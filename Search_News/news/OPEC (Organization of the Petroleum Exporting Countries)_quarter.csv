Paramount: An Immensely Misunderstood Linear Networks Business,"""Please Not Another Article About Streaming!"" Don't worry, this won't be yet another article mainly about whether streaming will work or not (and yet I won't come around to say a few words about it).IThe asset falls under the ""linear TV is dying"" category on Wall Street and is, in my opinion, a very misunderstood asset, which is far more attractive than it appears. To begin with, here is a brief overview of the performance over the last few years:It is unfortunately very difficult to get an accurate picture of CBS because 1.) Paramount+ has had a significant negative impact on OIBDA over the entire period (please note that in 2018, the results of each division are skewed by the inclusion of Paramount+, at the time called CBS All Access), 2.) the profitability of each division is difficult to figure out, and 3.) CBS has been integrated into the results of the other Linear Networks since 2022, which means there is no accurate data available for the last year.However, let's get into the three segments, Advertising, Affiliate and Licensing: The revenue mix consists mainly of advertising during sports programs, prime time/ non-sports programming and news, as well as political advertising. As can be seen historically, revenue in this area can fluctuate greatly, due on the one hand to the cyclical nature of the business tied to the economy, but also due to the rotating broadcasting rights of the Superbowl and NCAA Championship Games, as well as the political cycle.To better understand the value of the advertising business, it makes sense to break down the revenue into its components: According to media , CBS generated around $1 billion in NFL advertising revenue in the 21/22 season. That year, CBS did not have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl. It is important to note that the Super Bowl alone has an  of around $550-600 million on the overall result. By my own estimate, the remaining advertising revenue from sports (primarily PGA Tour, NCAA and UEFA CL) accounts for another $700 million+. I assume here that these content rights like the NFL will also be amortized over the entire business and advertising revenue will therefore only account for around 75% of the future license fees (which will be sub $850 million, as will become more clear below). This means that in an off year without the Superbowl, around $1.7+ billion in advertising revenues are generated with sports, and in a year with the Superbowl around $2.3+ billion (excluding the other, smaller sports rights), or about 30-50% of the overall advertising business. On top of that, there is political advertising. Here, too, the actual revenue is very difficult to estimate. Political ads are generally very high margin (according to our own estimates well above 50%+), which has the very simple reason that politicians do not think in terms of return on investment in the economic sense, but in electoral votes, which means that the financial incentives will always be to use the raised capital as extensively as possible. According to my own analysis, based on business reports from the big four broadcasters CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC, as well as owners of tv stations such as Gray Television, I estimate the bottomline impact to be around $350-450 million, so political ads revenue should be conservatively somewhere around $800 million+ in political years.The remaining revenue is divided between news and other programming. I estimate that in 2022 advertising revenue was around 4.8-5 billion due to the lack of revenue from several sporting events, offset by political ads.This means that on an adjusted basis >50% of Advertising revenue comes from revenue sources that a) are very acyclical and b) historically show an upward trend in Advertising spending. Only <50% of the Advertising business is thus affected strongly by secular decline. And CBS, as the broadcaster with the largest reach and the highest rated content, should be even less affected than its peers, as will become clearer later. The second misunderstood part of CBS. In a nutshell, affiliate revenues represent revenues from MVPDs (cable, satellite, etc.) and vMVPDs (YouTube TV, etc.) as well as revenues from local TV stations (also called affiliate stations).To specify this: MVPDs/vMVPDs compensate the TV stations owned by CBS (currently CBS owns 26 TV stations) for the right to retransmit the program, while local tv stations pay CBS as broadcaster for the right to broadcast the program.Therefore, there are three relevant players in the distribution chain: Broadcasters (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox), local TV Broadcasting Stations (Gray Television, Nexstar, etc.) and MVPDs/vMVPDs (e.g. Comcast, YouTube TV). Broadcasters charge fees to local TV broadcasting stations (reverse comp), which in turn charge fees to MVPDs/vMVPDs (retransmission revenue). Affiliate fees thus represent a cost block for MVPDs/vMVPDs, while they generate revenues for local tv stations and broadcasters.The distribution of power is easy to understand: Broadcasting programming is essential for MVPDs, because to put it bluntly, without sports programming there is almost no reason for the masses to still use cable TV. Not broadcasting sports programming is unthinkable for linear TV providers, as it would lead to churn being even higher than it already is. TV stations, on the other hand, serve only as an intermediary. Apart from broadcasting the programming they do not add any value to the supply chain and therefore do not have much of a say, but they do participate in the pie to a certain extent by passing on the affiliate fees they receive from the broadcasters (reverse comp) to MVPDs (retransmission revenue). The broadcasters as owners of the content rights have the clear position of power and therefore the dominant bargaining position. As Bill Gates likes to quote: ""Content is king"".This is also historically reflected in P&L statements. MVPDs have increasing costs and decreasing margins, as it becomes more and more difficult for them to pass on the TV stations retrans fee increases to the end customers (especially under falling subscriber numbers). TV stations, on the other hand, are making increasing profits in absolute terms, but are making ever smaller margins, as they can only pass on the affiliate fee increases to a share of <1. Broadcasters (like CBS) are happy to renegotiate prices on average every three years and in the meantime benefit from annual price increases with high incremental margins (while this is not directly clear, the margins should be WELL above the 15% EBIT margin that CBS achieves, as affiliate fees require almost no incremental costs). CBS, acting as a broadcaster, generally charges fixed fees and, acting as a broadcasting TV stations owner, has built escalators into the contracts to counteract the loss of customers. This is different for ABC, for example, which uses variable contracts and is negatively affected by subscriber losses.According to own estimates, reverse comp conservatively accounts for >70% of affiliate revenues, while retrans revenue accounts for <30%, which minimizes the downside risk from subscriber losses enormously.The bull thesis vor Broadcasters and local TV stations owners is that broadcasting has around 30% of viewing time on pay TV providers, but only has a revenue share in the high teens. This gap has been attempted to be reduced in recent years and will probably continue to be closed in the future. Based on the historical development (CBS sales are skewed, but retrans fees of TV stations have grown with ca. 6% CAGR in the last 5 years and historically with well over 20%), I expect that the segment will GROW with 5-10% and high incremental margins in the long run, starting from ~$3 billion in 2023. In brief, CBS licenses the content it produces to any possible content provider. Unfortunately, there is very little information on this division. However, revenues can fluctuate greatly and are very lumpy, as IPs are licensed on an irregular basis, and are furthermore (apart from some productions) associated with very low margins. Based on historical development, I assume that licensing will neither grow nor decline.Now that we have understood the drivers, let's move on to a way to think about the business in the long term.CBS continues to own the rights of the NFL through 2033 (with average rights-costs of $2,1 billion per year), while being allowed to broadcast the Super Bowl for the 2023, 2027 and 2031 seasons, as well as the AFC in every year. CBS also owns the TV rights of the PGA Tour until 2030 (~$250 million), the rights of the Big Ten (football as well as basketball) from 23/24 onwards until the 29/30 season (~$350 million) and the rights of the UEFA Championsleague until 2030 ($250 million).It is important to note that the market is afraid that CBS will experience a bottomline hit of around $1.5 billion in the worst case due to license renewals beginning 23/24, as the new contracts for NFL (+$1.1 billion), Big Ten (+$300 million) and UEFA (+$150 million) will be in effect. However, as contracts are usually based on annual price increases, I expect the hit to be significantly lower, as the published cost of rights only indicates the average over the period of the contract.To highlight this point with the NFL as an example, because I think this is greatly misunderstood by investors and the media: When the media  that NFL right costs are increasing from $1.1 billion to $2.1 billion, they are referring to the average for the period of the contract, since explicit contract terms are typically not communicated. This means that the cost this year for NFL rights will be WELL above the $1.1 billion average for the contract period ending 22/23 and then WELL below the $2.1 billion average for the contract period ending 32/33. There will likely be a one-time bump up in cost, but by no means the $1 billion implied by first level thinking!So on the cost side, you have rising license costs in the long-term and in addition secular decline in the topline. But at the same time, you have immense tailwinds, both in 2024 and long-term. If you look at 2024, this is the first year CBS is going to air a Super Bowl, Big Ten Championship Games, more UEFA CL Games and the U.S. elections at the same time. Simultaneously, you're going to get higher affiliate revenues, which will come with very high incremental margins. According to my own estimate, this will more than compensate for the headwinds and lead to EBIT GROWTH instead of EBIT decline. So what does this mean in concrete numbers?The bottom line of CBS next year overall is probably impossible to predict due to the many drivers that will impact the bottom line. An unsatisfactory answer, isn't it? Nevertheless, I would like to share a few thoughts.I estimate that CBS' current EBIT, adjusted for Paramount+, to be around 1.8-2 billion. As I mentioned before, I see a high probability that EBIT will grow next year, because especially political ads and affiliate revenues are associated with very high margins/incremental margins and also mentioned sporting events are aired, which also have a significant impact on the bottom line. So you have tremendous tailwinds in 2024. The tailwinds will be largely non-existent in 2025, temporarily potentially leading to a significant cut in profitability. How much? No idea and I don't think anyone knows.Still, it's worth pointing out that CBS has huge long-term benefits. People will always consume sports, while costs for sports ads will very likely  steadily over the next decade. Sports as a commodity is still very valuable for companies, since due to scarcity and almost no vulnerability to disruption holders of the rights are in a very advantageous negotiation position with advertisers. CBS has (especially with the NFL) some of the most attractive sports rights for the next decade, with all licensing contracts already negotiated, which makes the business in sports overall predictable.The same is true for spending on political ads, which has been  for a decade and will likely continue to do so for the next decade. CBS, as the largest broadcaster with the largest national reach, will benefit greatly and is expected to continue to do so, making the political ads business more or less predictable. In addition, as described earlier, affiliate is also predictable.The component that is least predictable is the secular headwind, primarily in the news and non-sports programming business, which accounts for <50% of the ads business. However, it bears repeating here that CBS is probably by far the most attractive of all broadcasters in this business.So will CBS still be around in 10 years? The probability is more than very high. Even as CBS declines in viewing time in the linear networks model, viewing time elsewhere (vMVPDS and streaming services like Paramount) continues to increase, counteracting secular decline and therefore minimizing CBS's downside risks. So maybe CBS won't exist with the profitability of today (this is also debatable), but most likely the asset will hugely profitable for many years to come. According to my own estimates, it is realistic that the business will generate an average of >1.5 billion in EBIT in the coming years. This is below today's levels and is therefore conservative in my view. Why?Contrary to the headwinds, primarily due to rising licensing costs and secular headwinds, there are long-term topline tailwinds due to 1) sports/political advertising, 2) affiliation fees and 3) secular TAILWINDS due to vMVPD/streaming, which makes CBS more valuable for advertisers also in news and non-sports programming. All in all, I think this will lead to a slightly declining to constant bottom line, conservatively estimated on a net basis.Doesn't seem like a dying asset, does it?For a premium asset with the quality of CBS, a valuation of 10-12x EBIT therefore is in my opinion accurate. This means that CBS should be valued at between $15-18 billion today. The valuation is a premium to , however, this should be justified due to the higher scale and brand value of CBS.In addition, there is the CBS Broadcast Building. The asset is a very attractive 860k sqf asset in Midwest Manhattan. Paramount sold a comparable building (Television City) in 2021 for $760m. I personally estimate the value to be between $750-1000 million, considering Manhattan real estate prices. The business is currently for sale and will generate additional cash, bringing the total value of CBS to $15.8-19 billion.I view this segment with a more pessimistic eye. First, to the numbers, which include BET, Showtime, Paramount, MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and all of the other networks:In this segment, too, the exact figures are difficult to determine because 1.) BET+, Pluto TV, Showtime+ and the other streaming businesses (excluding Para+) are included in the result until 2021 (here, as again, 2018 must be adjusted) and 2.) here, as well, the profitability of the individual businesses is difficult to work out.Broken down, Linear Networks too consists of the Advertising, Affiliate and Licensing segments: Advertising is unfortunately less attractive than at CBS, as the linear networks unfortunately cannot compete with the sports assets that CBS has to offer. Linear TV is less and less attractive for advertisers (except in years of political elections, where a high reach is required) and I guess this trend will continue going forward. How powerful? No idea, and I don't think anyone knows. This is no different for affiliates. Affiliate fees in this segment look a little different from CBS. In a nutshell, Linear Networks receive a variable fee from MVPDs that is tied to the subscriber count. The trend in this area is relatively simple to understand. Linear Networks increase fees while subscriber counts fall. Historically, however, fee increases have not been strong enough to offset subscriber losses, which equates to falling revenue and profitability for Linear Networks. Will this trend continue? Very likely. In any case, there is no reason to believe otherwise at this time. How powerful? No idea, and I think the answer is also written in the stars here. There is not too much to say about Licensing, but there has been a boost in recent years, driven in part by production for third parties. Revenues and thus profitability can fluctuate greatly and tend to be very lumpy. As an example, take South Park, which was licensed in 2019 for $500 million for 2020-2025, with an EBIT margin close to 100% (Paramount has a 51% JV share, so $250 Million in EBIT for Paramount). If Paramount licenses the IPO again in 2025, it can take a very strong impact on the EBIT margin of that year. My guess is that the licensing business will develop in a very lumpy way going forward.So what will the segment return in the future? You probably don't want to hear it, but I don't have the slightest idea. Will the EBIT of the business and therefore the FCF decrease? I think in all likelihood the answer is yes. How much? I don't know and I guess probably nobody has a clue. But will the business still exist for the next five years? Of course, no transformation goes within a couple of years. Bulls would say (if there are any) that subscriber losses will slow as the older generation is not ready to switch to streaming, which would mean that linear networks will continue to generate cash flows for many years. Evidence shows that viewing time has actually even  for people >65. Will it still exist in ten years? The question is more difficult to answer, but it is clear that the business will serve as an attractive cash cow for most of the way until then, as management will squeeze every penny it can out of the business.Overall, it should be noted that the business today generates about $3 billion in EBIT. In my opinion, a valuation of 4-6x EBIT is an appropriate valuation for a declining asset, resulting in a valuation of $12-18 billion. Compared with other linear networks assets, which are mostly trading at high single digit EBITDA multiples, this valuation should be considered as very conservative.Even if the business goes completely bust, you still have very valuable IPs, like Spongebob, South Park and co. that can be licensed for years and bring in cash flows per the Sony model. And this is just one of many creative ways to generate cash flows in a worst-case scenario. I think the market reaction is way too hyperbolic.My thesis on streaming is very unconventional and is very much based on the view of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, who discussed streaming at their . In a nutshell, I personally believe that streaming is a commodity product. Streamers serve a limited number of eyeballs with an infinite supply of series and movies, which makes the various streaming providers seem very undifferentiated overall, while converging over time to an even more undifferentiated supply as content spending remains very high. Fundamentally, streaming is thus not a good business given high competition in a saturated market, but can become a good business through 1) price increases or 2) consolidation. 1) implies an oligopoly, 2) the evolution towards one. For price increases to be successful, they must happen across the board because, assuming a commodity market, subscribers will otherwise switch to an alternative, cheaper streaming service. This will not happen, however, as there are short-term incentives to reduce the price in order to gain customers and achieve a higher benefit at the expense of the other streamers. Thus, in game theory terms, prices are kept low in anticipation of competitor decisions, which is rational for all competitors, but still disadvantageous (the result is paretoinefficient), since all competitors would be better off with higher prices. However, the less competition there is in the market, the easier indirect coordination becomes, and hence the more likely it is that players will collectively raise prices, as the risk of short-term profit maximization through price deviation at the expense of long-term profit sacrifice becomes smaller. I think two aspects are very interesting in this regard:1) Gunnar Wiedenfels  openly about the issue since the beginning of the year and has the strong opinion that streaming providers offer too much value for too little price and ergo price increases would be rational.2) Every streaming provider (excluding tech) has raised prices in the last 9 months. Disney with its recently announced second price increase continues the trend. It is not unlikely that tit-for-tat is currently being played to test oligopolistic tendencies. Overarching price increases mean that as a consumer, there is no incentive to switch streaming providers, as there is not much of a cost advantage.So are we already in an oligopolistic market? I don't know, but there are a few reasons why not: Supply goes beyond the big 5 with tech players and smaller providers, high churn could lead to incentives to reduce prices again, lack of scale with small providers, etc. Overall, I think price trends are probably impossible to predict. Accordingly, it remains to be seen how the market will develop. If price increases do not work, the only thing left to do is consolidation. Consolidation reduces competition and ergo increases the chance of being able to raise prices in the future. Paramount, along with Peacock, is an attractive takeover candidate as one of the two smaller suppliers, but any consolidation is beneficial to the industry and especially to Paramount. It can be seen that there is already a lot of consolidation going on (Showtime, Bundeling, etc..).What happens if none of this materializes? This would be unfavorable for all competitors and streaming will remain the unattractive business it currently is. Will this happen? Of course, anything is possible, but I think it is unlikely, as there are almost no incentives to do so in the long run.So will Paramount's DTC business become profitable? First, let's look at the numbers:To give the answer: I don't think so. Personally, I think the probability of the business not becoming profitable is higher than it becoming profitable. Why? Lack of scale and little pricing power due to high competition.For my valuation, I therefore assume a total negative value of $4 billion. The business will probably generate a loss of around $2 billion this year, of which >1 billion has already been taken into account. I assume that the loss will be strongly reduced in the next years by 1) the integration of Showtime (up to $700 million), 2) the announced less spending and 3) growing topline. Furthermore, I assume that management will act rationally and not finance a loss-making business ad infinitum. With the financial incentives  for Sheri Redstone and Bob Bakish and the involvement of Warren Buffet, anything else would be irrational in my opinion. Accordingly, I consider a negative value of $4 billion to be justified and conservative, and positive surprises are not priced into my valuation.To give an example for a positive surprise: Not included in my valuation is PlutoTV, which could be enormously valuable for Paramount in the coming years. PlutoTV is a $1 billion+ advertising business that was  in early 2019 for $340 million. The business has since scaled from 12 million MAU to ~80 million MAU and is accordingly many times larger than it was a few years ago.Let's move on to the last part of Paramount, Filmed Entertainment. The business consists mainly of Paramount Studios and is responsible for Paramount's theatrical releases. Accordingly, the business is enormously volatile in both the top and bottom line:What is the value of Paramount Studios?To be conservative, I compare Paramount Studios to MGM, which was  to Amazon for $8.5 billion in 2022, and value the asset at the same price. I do consider that as conservative, as Paramount Studios is significantly larger than MGM and, in my opinion, the IP is significantly more valuable.Downside protection: In addition to the IP, the studio owns Paramount Pictures Studio in LA, which totals 62 acres at 1.85 billion sq ft. The building can be compared to CBS Studio Center (LA, 40 acres in size), which was sold in 2021 for about $1.85 billion. It can be assumed that as a premium asset, the asset is worth at least as much, if not significantly more. So PPS alone could potentially be worth $2.5-3 billion. So even if I am wrong with my estimate of $8.5 billion, there is a huge downside protection due to the real estate value underlying it.Let's get into the SOTP valuation:Included in cash is the sale of Simon & Schuster for $1.3 billion (= Net Proceeds).Based on my valuation, this provides an upside potential of 110%-260%, or 2x-3.5x. .A Turning advertising cycle in addition to a strongly depressed market leads to declining cashflows in the short term. However, the advertising market is highly cyclical and should reach a higher level in the medium to long term.A decreasing bargaining power in the affiliate business, especially at CBS, causes a significant cash flow driver to weaken, which would invalidate my thesis.Long-term rising streaming costs combined with the absence of a decision to close the business will result in Paramount generating significantly less cash than expected and therefore invalidate my thesis.National Amusements  would cause short term selling pressure and therefore a declining share price. However, this would not impact the fundamentals of the business.An ongoing  involves the risk that Paramount's services will become less attractive to customers, which may in particular jeopardize the streaming services business.I think CBS is an overlooked and misunderstood asset within Paramount that, in combination with the Linear Networks business, is going to generate significantly more cashflow than the market expects. At the same time, there is significant downside protection due to the asset value as described, which leads to an investment case a la ""Heads I win, Tails I don't lose much"".

Devon Energy: Ignored Oil Play,"The potential  ()   () should make  () even more appealing. The independent energy company trades at yearlyDevon Energy was oddly left out of the recent rally in oil. The stock now trades at multi-year lows, even despite the big potential merger in the energy space and oil prices that spiked to $90/bbl.Exxon Mobil is potentially bidding for Pioneer Natural Resources in a move to boost oil production from the Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil actually hit an all-time high right prior to news ofWhile the details of a potential $60 billion merger are unknown and might not even happen, the interesting aspect is the valuation disconnect between Devon and Pioneer here. Devon trades at only 6.6x forward EPS estimates while Pioneer trades at 9.9x EPS targets and Exxon Mobil is rumored as willing to pay another 10% premium for Pioneer on top of the rally on Friday.Even Exxon Mobil now trades at 12.0x forward EPS targets. The stock market is oddly favoring the energy giant over the independent producers, hence one reason the company is probably targeting Pioneer. The deal could be very accretive with the use of cash, though shareholders are unlikely to want Exxon Mobil to pile on a bunch of debt again.Devon Energy continues to boost oil production with guidance for Q3 production reaching 322K b/d to 330K b/d, up from 323K b/d back in Q2. Oil production growth reached 8% YoY and total production hit 662K boe/d.The odd part here is that Pioneer Resources only produced 369K b/d of oil during Q2 with total production at 710K boe/d. The independent energy company had oil production at 52% of total production, slightly above the 49% oil production levels at Devon.One has to really question the valuation discrepancy between Pioneer with a potential offer for $60 billion and Devon Energy trading with a current market cap of only $28 billion. The issue really isn't the valuation for Pioneer at $60 billion with forecasts for annual free cash flow topping $5 billion annually with WTI prices at $80/bbl.Devon now offers investors a massive dividend opportunity. The energy company pays a fixed $0.20 quarterly dividend amounting to a 1.8% dividend yield while the variable amount hit $0.29 during Q2 and the higher oil prices are likely to help boost this amount.Based on a consistent $0.49 quarterly dividend, Devon would pay a $1.96 annual dividend offering a 4.5% dividend yield. On top of these dividend payouts, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares for $200 million during Q2 and the current stock weakness along with oil prices rallying to $90 provides an ideal opportunity to buy very cheap shares.The key investor takeaway is that Devon Energy just appears an ignored energy stock despite strong profits and capital returns. Exxon Mobil might be chasing Pioneer due to Permian Basis resources and a CEO looking to retire making a deal more possible, but Devon Energy is the much cheaper play here.Investors in Pioneer Natural Resources should use any offer from Exxon Mobil to flip the investment into Devon Energy. One can sell Pioneer at all-time highs and flip that investment into Devon at multi-year lows.Stone Fox Capital (aka Mark Holder) is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

Suncor Energy: Oil Prices Spiking As This 4.5% Yield Beast Becomes A Buy,"Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome WA Research as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Offering a double-digit upside potential as my price target sits above $42 per share, investing in Suncor Energy () stock seems like an obvious choice currently. The average 5-year net income growth has been 6.47% and the dividend growth during the same period is 7.33%. The management is moving the company into a phase where it's leveraging its solidified asset base and distributing large sums of earnings to shareholders. The price indicates a 23.5% upside at the moment and with market sentiment somewhat mixed, the light is shining on the buyers right now.SU is strategically positioned to harness the potential for an imminent oil price surge over the next few months. Moreover, the company is well-prepared for the long-term challenges posed by a world where economically viable global oil reserves are becoming increasingly scarce. SU boasts one of the industry's most impressive reserve life ratios, emphasizing its strong foothold in ensuring a sustainable and robust energy future.Even with the push towards renewables, the production levels of SU have been growing very well on a YoY basis, up to 814 mbbls/d as of Q2 FY2023. Utilization rates have also been increasing and sit at 85. The price of crude oil has increased substantially in the last few months and sits at over $87. In 2022, the oil prices  at $100 for the year. Should we see a rapid increase here, it seems likely that we will see a rapid increase in the share price as well for SU to display optimism for future earnings. But I do think there is a case to be made here as well that SU can provide a strong dividend-paying opportunity for a portfolio. SU has the qualities I seek right now like strong margins and further utilization rate of the assets as the top line has appreciated faster than total assets. Seeing as the management is already growing production levels I think this is indicative of their positive view on the market conditions.To underscore the company's current trajectory to grow its production levels, it seems they are impressively increasing economic investment capital. For 2023,  sees a total investment and sustainment & maintenance capital rate of $5.4 - $5.8 billion. Since 2020, the capital expenditures have increased to $4.2 billion, but sit below where it was back in 2017. That year had expenditures of $5.2 billion, and it seems we are heading back there too. Revenues that year were $25 billion, which SU has surpassed by a long shot this year and last too. The reason I am bringing this up is to highlight the improved efficiency of the business and its capability to limit expenditures whilst also quickly raising the bottom line.With SU you are getting a solid dividend payer as the yield inches above 4.5% currently. The long-term outlook as we have discussed is positive for the company as necessities like oil and gas are going to be persistent. My argument for this lies in that the sheer cost and amount of resources needed for transitioning fully to an energy renewables society is just not going to happen in a few years, it's a slow and steady transition.The market seems quite positive on the business right now, with SA analysts and Wall Street both rating it a buy. I fall in the same camp as the fantastic margins of the business has made it a winner in my book.The chart indicates very well the relationship between the share price and the net margins of the business. During 2020 we saw a steep decline as oil prices plummeted. It has recovered very well since but did cause SU to have a negative NI margin of over 15%. Oil prices averaged $41 that year and the company  $4.1 billion in EBT, Including unusual items which pushed earnings down. I think SU stands in a better position these days than in 2020 as interest expenses have declined to $610 million TTM, a result of impressive  of over $6 billion since then, $4 billion in 2022, and $2.1 billion in 2021. There seems to be a consensus that rates will stay  for a longer time. I find it likely that interest expenses of over $600 million TTM is likely for SU even if they pay down large amounts of debt as refinancing may be done at higher rates. Below we will get into more of the price targets I have for the company, but in short, I see the outlook for oil and gas as very positive and the forecasted price target I have for SU indicates a 23% upside potential currently.Last  showcases a net earnings decline of over $2 billion from Q2 FY2022 results. This has been the result of softer commodity prices. It's important to remember though that volatility is to be expected in this industry as we have seen above. In times of strong oil prices the distributable cash flows for SU increase and so does quite often the optimism from the market causing the share price to appreciate in value. But then of course in times of lower oil prices the SU dividend prospects somewhat decrease, but over time I think will average out.The returns to shareholders have still been quite positive though, sitting at $1.3 billion, still down from $3.2 billion a year prior. I think it's important to realize that the increase in shareholder returns largely came from increased buybacks. The dividends have been growing steadily over the years and are higher than in 2022, averaging a 5-year annual growth of 7.33%. What I am looking more at though is the repayments of debt that SU has focused on, declining over $1 billion since December 31, 2022. Whilst other companies have been largely affected by higher interest rates, SU has not seen the same rise as prioritizing debt repayments has been maintained. The oil sands  of the company have still been very positive on the business as it was over $1.5 billion last quarter and $3.2 billion YTD. Capital expenditures for the assets have grown, and the inflated oil prices the previous year's quarter offered inflated the FCF too. I don't expect similar numbers for either Q3 or Q4, but a slight increase in both capital expenditures and FCF I see as likely. In most years the price of oil prices rallies somewhat into the colder months of the year which supports the previous statements about raised FCF in the coming quarters. As a final price, I want to include the positive work SU has done on its cash position, which is the highest since 2017 at over $1.9 billion. This amount is capable of covering over 10% of the debt position which I factor as a strong position, and is one of the several arguments I have for a slight premium valuation and buy case.On the overview of productions and operating costs, I think SU is in a good position right now. The company remains profitable at $30 - $33 bbl for the oil sands operations. This is also the largest site for productions, anticipated to generate 385.000 - 425.000 for 2023. The Syncrude operations are the least profitable at $39 - $43 per barrel. The guidance indicates strong refinery utilization rates at 92 - 96% and with the low threshold for strong profits SU will likely post strong earnings for 2023.There are some planned maintenance for 2023 and this will impact the quarterly mbpd with Base Plant U2 at the largest, 65 and 70 in Q3 and Q4 respectively. Should it be revealed that impacts may be prolonged or maintenance behind schedule I think we should anticipate a slight dip in the share price, but something that likely will be short-lived.Above we have the current price targets for SU, ranging from $50.99 to $35.88 with an average of $39.61. This average is under my price target of $42, which I justify by the fact SU has made implied improvements in the last few years, like significant debt repayments which have limited the impacts of higher interest rates. The interest expenses are far below that of a few years ago and have enabled strong returns to be sustainable for shareholders. At a share price of $42 SU trades at an earnings multiple of 10.79, given current 2023 predictions of $3.89. The 10.79 p/e is above where SU has been , which is 10.52. But as I said, SU is in a better position today than in 2020 and has as a result grown into a premium valuation. The $42 target implies roughly a 23% upside from today's levels, an immediate upside far outperforming that of broader market indexes, enabling a buy to be made here.Over the short term, the oil market remains highly vulnerable to substantial price fluctuations, largely influenced by the dynamic geopolitical landscape. Notably, elevated oil prices can evolve from economic matters to political challenges, potentially involving government actions such as tax policy modifications and trade regulations, all of which can introduce an element of unpredictability into SU's near-term financial prospects. The intricacies of managing this multifaceted energy market underline the intricate nature of the industry.We have seen negative oil prices affect companies in the industry previously. During 2020, which was a surprising year, the price of oil declined heavily and so did many oil companies. But what has been proven is a certain resilience in businesses like SU as shareholder returns continued, with dividends and buybacks amounting to over $1.5 billion. Short-term volatility is a risk with companies like SU, but I don't think it's an adequate risk that trumps the prospects of making it a long-term position.My target of $42 is within reach as SU is growing its assets and paying back debt efficiently. The impact of higher interest rates has been limited, and I think as they decline SU will post even higher EPS results. The upside is over 23% and recent spikes in oil imply that Q3 and Q4 may showcase strong NI YoY growth, as production levels remain high. The 4.5% dividend is a solid addition to the buy case as well, one that seems sustainable as well given the positive  for traditional energy sources like crude oil.

Solid Power Keeps Charging Ahead In The SSB Revolution,"Solid Power () is coming off another strong quarter in terms of strategy execution. However, despite this, the stock price has significantly declined since I  it. There have been significant developments, particularly inThe drop in the stock price has not changed my opinion; in fact, it has reinforced my BUY rating. In my view, the fundamentals remain strong from both key perspectives: on the financial side, the pace at which liquidity is being utilized remains exactly as planned; on the technological side, Solid Power's powder has passed all 12 internally conducted tests in collaboration with BMW.I recommend reading my previous analysis of the stock to get an overall picture of the company'sSolid Power is a company specializing in solid-state batteries (SSBs). These batteries represent an evolution of the lithium-ion batteries currently used in EVs and battery storage. They are safer, as they are less flammable, offer higher energy density, longer lifespan, and faster recharge capabilities. Despite being a ""revolution in the making"" talked about for years, no one has yet managed to create a commercially scalable offering capable of dominating applications like EVs, eVTOLs, or battery storage.Unlike other companies that aim to develop, manufacture, and sell solid-state batteries, Solid Power has a different business model. They focus on the essential component that makes these batteries possible, namely, the electrolyte. The electrolyte is what sits between the anode and cathode, the two poles of a battery. In the case of traditional lithium-ion batteries, the electrolyte is liquid or gel-like; in the case of solid-state batteries, it is, as the name suggests, a solid. More specifically, in the case of Solid Power, we are talking about a powder.Solid Power intends to sell its electrolyte to OEMs and battery manufacturers. These companies can then choose to use the powder in combination with their own designs or even request licensing for the complete battery designs developed by Solid Power. This makes the business capital-light, highly agile, and rapidly scalable. Most importantly, in laboratory tests, Solid Power's powder has already shown excellent results, and the company is actively working on scaling up production.The latest earnings call was led for the first time by John Van Scoter, the new CEO who replaced Dave Jansen. Jansen has been serving as Chairman since 2012 and as interim CEO since November 2022. As of October 8th, Jansen no longer holds any role within the company.Van Scoter appears to be an excellent choice for Solid Power. His first significant role was as Senior VC at Texas Instruments, a position he held until 2008. From that point on, he went on to work for a series of significant companies in the fields of electronics, semiconductors, and innovation:The new CEO wasted no time in presenting a concrete plan during the : to bring Solid Power's technology to South Korea. He believes that this is a critical market to establish a presence in at this moment, given the fierce competition among companies involved in R&D, battery OEMs, vehicle manufacturers, and electronics giants.Solid Power now occupies a significant portion of my portfolio, so I wanted to delve deep into the potential of the South Korean market. South Korea currently stands as  for research and development in solid-state battery technology.SK On has recently developed a solid-state electrolyte that achieved a world record in ionic conductivity, and they have had a partnership with Solid Power since October 2021. Ionic conductivity measures how quickly ions travel within the battery, directly impacting battery output and charging speed. The achievement came through collaboration with Dankook University and was published in Advanced Functional Materials.Samsung, on the other hand, commenced production of its solid-state batteries in June, with plans to start shipping to customers by the end of 2023.LG Energy Solution has initiated an extensive partnership campaign with public entities and private companies. It could very well be the anonymous partner that, according to Solid Power's latest earnings call, provided ""positive feedback"" on SLDP's electrolyte.Van Scoter has clearly identified this market as a significant variable for Solid Power, just three months into his new role. When a company primarily focused on R&D and essentially pre-revenue rapidly makes such an expansion decision, it likely indicates that something substantial has already transpired behind the scenes in my opinion.Quoting from the latest earnings call: was also crucial for another element - the commencement of full-scale electrolyte production. This production is overseen by a part of BMW North America's team, present directly at Solid Power's facility, as per the terms of the joint development agreement between the two companies.Solid Power and BMW have outlined a list of 12 specific parameters that the electrolyte must meet. While there are no guarantees that the laboratory test results will replicate in mass production, Solid Power has announced that the currently produced material passes all tests. The third and fourth quarters of 2023 will thus be dedicated to ramping up production, aided by the arrival of new machinery, and, most importantly, sending samples and gathering feedback from potential customers.The company assured shareholders during the latest earnings call that BMW's feedback has already been very positive. Collaboration with BMW's headquarters in Munich has even begun, indicating that the JDA with Solid Power is no longer a ""peripheral bet.""The other important JDA, the one with Ford (), has been renewed. All these positive developments bode well for the coming quarters.At present, Solid Power's revenues are solely derived from joint development agreements and public contracts, so there isn't much to comment on in terms of growth.Operating expenses and SGA expenses have increased as expected, as the company now prioritizes production volume expansion. Capex has decreased slightly compared to previous quarters and is nearly halved from a year ago. Below are the most important financial figures for Solid Power at this moment, bearing in mind that it is a company preparing for commercial sales on a large scale in 2024 (figures in $ millions, source: Seeking Alpha).Crucially, it's important to note that the company remains debt-free, a factor I previously highlighted in my initial analysis as a pivotal one. Not only that, but Solid Power has reiterated its forecast to become self-sustaining in terms of cash flows before needing another round of financing. Quoting the :Compared to my initial analysis, it doesn't seem that competitors have made significant strides. Currently, the primary risk is competition because being the pioneer holds immense value: whoever can first develop a winning technology at affordable prices for large-scale SSB production could potentially find themselves in the same position that Nvidia () enjoys today in the world of generative AI chips.Toyota () has confirmed the arrival of its first SSB-equipped car in 2024, theoretically boasting a range of 900+ miles. There are skeptics, partly due to the limited details revealed so far, but it's reasonable to assume that such a giant may want to fly under the radar until it's ready to surprise everyone with its first commercially saleable model. In terms of PR, Toyota has always maintained an approach opposite to that of Tesla.A significant leap appears to be made by Factorial Energy, a small Massachusetts-based company with a business model very similar to Solid Power's. In January 2022, it closed a $200 million financing round led by Mercedes and Stellantis (), making it a player not to be underestimated. The company  of its first solid-state batteries to commercial partners. This news is only a few days old, so it will take some time before receiving feedback from customers. Factorial has also begun working on a 50,000+ square feet facility for battery production, but it lags behind Solid Power in terms of production.Of course, there are also short-term factors that could move the stock price. We are in the midst of a Treasury price collapse that is shaking Wall Street, but this is a variable that cannot weigh as heavily as Solid Power's internal fundamentals. Even if the stock price could drop further in the coming weeks, to me, this would be an opportunity to buy at a discount.Solid Power is continuing its journey exactly as expected, which is no small feat for such a young company working on an emerging technology. Compared to my previous analysis, I believe that the advancements made in production are shortening the time required before SLDP's technological potential transforms into economic results. While I initially indicated a horizon of 2-3 years, I am now convinced that within the next 12 months, we will truly discover the company's future. Customer feedback and production levels will tell us if we are indeed facing the most significant promise in the world of solid-state batteries, as I believe we are.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Rivian: Buy The Panic (Rating Upgrade),"Rivian Automotive () saw its share price decline by one-fifth on Thursday after the electric vehicle company announced that it would raise more debt in order to finance the production ramp of the R1T and R1S. In aI rated Rivian  due to the company's narrowing losses and raised guidance in terms of productionAccording to the company's third-quarter  which was released at the beginning of the week, Rivian produced 16,304 electric vehicles at its manufacturing plant in Illinois in Q3'23, showing 17% quarter over quarter growth. The company also delivered 15,564 vehicles which was an improvement of 23% compared to the previous quarter.In the first nine months of the year, Rivian produced 39,691 electric vehicles, showing 177% year over year growth. The electric vehicle company has guided for 52 thousand electric vehicles to be produced in Illinois this year, meaning the company would have to produce another 12,309 electric vehicles in the fourth-quarter which should be easily achievable. Based on Rivian's third-quarter accomplishments, the EV firm would only have to achieve 75% of its Q3'23 production volume to meet guidance… a target that I believe will be easily surpassed.The Q3'23 production update demonstrates that Rivian has made significant progress in terms of growing its production and I now believe that the EV company will be able to fly past its recently raised production goal of 52 thousand EV units.Assuming a stable production volume quarter over quarter in Q4'23 (no growth), Rivian would be on track to produce approximately 56 thousand electric vehicles in FY 2023. If Rivian were to grow fourth-quarter production at the average sequential production rate achieved between Q1'23 and Q3'23, 31.7%, then Rivian would report 21,478 EVs produced in Q4'23.Rivian has said in a  filing that it seeks to raise $1.5B in convertible senior notes due 2030 (+ an option for another $225M) in a private offering which, of course, poses a dilution risk to investors. However, considering how much progress Rivian has made in terms of growing its production and how solid the balance sheet already is, I believe investors are overreacting to the debt raise.Rivian is burning through a lot of cash and a debt raise at some point was expected. Rivian burned through approximately $2.3B in cash in the first six months of the year, or about $1.15B per quarter. The debt raise is not an existential issue for the EV company, however, as it carried $10.2B in cash on its balance (including short term investments)… enough, by current cash burn rates, to last at least until the end of FY 2024. Rivian also carries very little debt on its balance sheet and can easily handle additional debt.Rivian is commanding a decent valuation multiplier factor although the EV company is not yet profitable. However, Rivian is still significantly cheaper than Lucid Group () and Rivian has pulled way ahead of the company in terms of production/delivery volume as well.Tesla () is still by far the most highly-valued electric vehicle company -- with a P/S ratio of 6.4X -- as it is the leader in the industry, has a global production and distribution network in place and is already profitable.Rivian is expected to achieve revenues of $6.85B in FY 2024 which implies a year over year top line growth rate of 59%. With a price-to-revenue ratio of 2.5X, Rivian is no longer as outrageously valued as it was in FY 2022 and the 20% drop on Thursday implies a much more favorable risk profile.I believe Rivian's risk profile has quite considerably decreased following Thursday's 20% decline, in my opinion. This is because the EV company reported material progress in terms of growing its production at the beginning of the week and investors are panicking over the debt offering which makes no sense to me. Rivian has a very solid balance sheet, a mountain of cash and very little debt. With delivery growth also soaring, Rivian doesn't seem to have a demand problem either.I have stayed on the sidelines with regard to Rivian for as long as the EV company has been listed on the stock market, but I am risking a small position now because I believe investors are overreacting to the $1.5B debt offering that was announced yesterday. Rivian is also doing much better in terms of growing production now and if the EV firm maintained Q3 production levels in the fourth-quarter... Rivian would fly past its 52 thousand EV production target. The debt offering is a short term negative for the shares, but the valuation is now much more attractive, and risks, in my opinion, have decreased following the production update!

Comstock Resources: Swing Producer,"Comstock Resources () has often noted the low production costs in presentations to shareholders. But this is only part of the picture. Antero Resources (), for example, has noted that the Haynesville is the ""swing production"" area that usuallyThis company has some of the best operating costs in the industry.An excellent margin is certainly an accomplishment. However, there also has to be sufficient production volume to provide a relatively fast payback. Otherwise, competitors with lower margins but more volume (orAlso, competitors with a higher value production may have a lower margin percentage but could still be more profitable because the absolute margin combined with the well production level could prove attractive.Yet the Haynesville has long been known to be the ""swing production area"".The Haynesville despite those low operating costs is the region where the rig count usually declines significantly. At least some of this is due to the fact that the Haynesville is a dry gas area. Antero Resources operates in an area that has rich gas parts as well as dry gas. So, even if the dry gas production has to stop drilling, oftentimes the rich gas still provides a decent return to justify activity. Antero Resources itself has been drilling rich gas for some time to take advantage of the extra value that liquids add to the production stream. Comstock Resources does not have that option.It turns out that the breakeven costs of dry gas producers in the Haynesville Area are relatively high. are relatively low, then obviously the drilling and completion costs have to be relatively expensive for the production volume in the Haynesville. It is the only thing left that raises the costs to the comparison shown above that makes the Haynesville the ""swing production"".This comparison actually comes from an older presentation. But based upon recent activity, the comparison still appears to be valid.The other big deal is that Antero Resources has positioned itself to get superior pricing as shown on the left part of the slide. Antero Resources actually has two pricing boosts. One of those comes from the liquids adding value to the revenue stream. The other is the ability to send product to strong pricing markets as shown above to get a premium price compared to many competitors. Many others end up with a discount., Comstock is kind of locked into lower prices. natural gas prices because management hedged. The actual price received was considerably below what Antero Resources Received. Combine that with the fact that Comstock Resources does not produce enough of the ""value added"" products to raise its average selling prices and it quickly becomes apparent why this company is located in the ""swing producer"" basin. This company closely follows the fortunes of natural gas. That is not true as much for Antero Resources (which produces a lot of products besides just natural gas).Now this situation could easily change as more natural gas export ability comes online in the near future. But for the time being, Comstock Resources appears to have a competitive disadvantage by focusing on dry gas production in the Haynesville.The higher costs also show as negative Free Cash Flow.When you have higher costs (at least compared to the average selling price) then raising production during a period of low prices, even if wise, often results in negative free cash flow.Now Antero Resources sold a fair amount of hedges as management noted because they believe that natural gas prices will strengthen in the future. This is based upon the lower rig activity among dry gas producers. Here you have a company reporting higher production that will be there when those anticipated stronger natural gas prices arrive. This is two different ways to have exposure to higher natural gas prices.Low production costs and leading margins mentioned by Comstock Resources play a key part in profitability. But they are not the only determinants of that profitability. Other important variables include the total cost of the well and the volume it flows.Now the costs shown above are reasonable for the Haynesville. But compared to other basins, these are expensive wells. Keep in mind that for the Permian, for example, I report well costs in the $3.5 million range. As shown above, the wells drilled by Comstock are a good deal more expensive. They also averaged something like 21 MMCF per day (very roughly) which is a huge production level. But the combination appears to be relatively high cost for a natural gas producer.Marcellus wells would be more expensive than that. But that is also why Antero Resources concentrates on rich gas rather than dry gas. Dry gas often has competition from places like the Permian where the decision to drill and produce is often based upon the price of oil. Therefore, whatever price that producer gets for natural gas is extra. Unfortunately, that extra production from oil wells keeps the price natural gas down to the detriment of dry gas producers.What is likely to help is the expanding ability of North America to export natural gas. North America has long seen lower natural gas prices than is the case for the far stronger world market. Therefore, as North America (likely) joins the world market in the future, this company stands to benefit from that change.Therefore, Comstock Resources is likely to have superior operating leverage (and is a strong buy on that basis) as North America joins the world market of usually much higher natural gas prices. That significant export ability appears to be in the near future. So the risk of Comstock Resources suffering a sustained downturn in selling prices appears to be fading with each month as more export capacity comes online in the near future. In the meantime, the upside potential of a company straddling the breakeven point currently could be very large.It is not so much that there are a lot of lower cost producers as there is production that happens regardless of the price of natural gas. The ability to right size the supply of natural gas through the ability to export is therefore critical. This company appears to have a bright future in that context. But for now, it is a swing producer.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience.

Energy Transfer Selling Off Is An Opportunity Yielding 9.66%,"Energy Transfer () is having a strong 2023 as units appreciated from $11.62 to a 52-week high of $13.67. Units of ET are retracing a bit after earnings, finishing the week down -4.06%. ET has now missed I am pro-renewable energy, and I am invested in several renewable energy companies because they are projected to increase their percentage in the global energy mix over the next several decades. Why I see the opportunity in renewables, I am a realist and understand that eradicating oil and gas isn't probable over the next 20-30 years. I continue to read many different energy industry publications to understand current trends and future predictions. I continue to allocate capital toward energy infrastructure companies due to the information I will share from these publications:Over the past decade, there hasn't been a year where global oil production exceeded the amount consumed. In 2022 the global economy consumed 97,309,000 Bpd of crude while the production level was 93,848,000 Bpd. Natural gas has been produced at a slight surplus over the period compared to the deficit of oil produced. The U.S. is the largest oil and gas producer, producing 18.93% of global oil production and 24.2% of global natural gas production. When Canada is accounted for, an additional 5.94% of oil production and 4.57% of natural gas production comes online. This is the main reason why I am consistently allocating capital to energy infrastructure companies. There is 24.87% of the global oil production and 28.77% of the global natural gas production occurring in North America, and it all needs to be treated and transported.The 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids and natural gas will increase through 2050 in the U.S. The U.S. will also remain a net exporter of petroleum and liquified natural gas (LNG) products. If the U.S., which is the largest oil and gas producing nation globally, is projected to increase production and be a net exporter through 2050, the logical conclusion is that more takeaway capacity will be needed, and energy infrastructure companies will generate larger levels of distributable cash flow (DCF) as more fuel passes through their systems.In  completed its acquisition of Lotus Midstream for a combination of $930 million in cash and 44.5 million of newly issued units. ET added 3,000 miles of active gathering lines and 2 million barrels of crude storage. ET is projecting that the integration of Lotus will generate significant synergies between the companies and immediately enhance their ability to generate free cash flow and distributable cash flow. I like the deal because it provides ET with a bi-directional connection from the Permian Basin to Cushing OK, and adds capacity to other major hubs, including Midland.ET finished Q2 generating $3.12 billion in Adjusted EBITDA and $2.04 billion of DCF on a consolidated basis. $1.54 billion of the total DCF is attributable to the partners of ET. ET saw its NGL fractionation volumes increase 5%, midstream gathering volumes increase 8%, NGL transportation volumes increase 13%, intrastate natural gas transportation volumes increase 3%, crude transportation increase by 23%. ET guided that in 2023 we will see between $13.1 billion and $13.4 billion in Adjusted EBITDA, which is the largest amount from all the MLPs.For the past several years, I have discussed ET's strength in the exporting sector and why it was a strategic move for the company. ET has export facilities on the East and Gulf coasts with a large pipeline system that spans over 120,000 miles. ET recently signed  to sell LNG from the proposed Lake Charles export facility in Louisiana. The first deal that was announced was with an unnamed Japanese consortium for the purchase of 1.6M tons/year for a 20-year term. The 2 agreement acts as a middleman where Swiss commodities trader Gunvor would buy LNG from Chesapeake Energy () at a price indexed to the Japan-Korea Marker for 15 years. CHK would supply the Lake Charles facility with enough volumes of gas to produce 1M tons/year for 15 years; after liquefaction. The 3 deal is with an unnamed U.S. customer and involves a tolling arrangement for 1M tons/year for 15 years.The Lake Charles facility has come under question, and on the conference call, ET discussed this project at length. In May of 2022, ET received an extension from FERC on the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. The DOE denied ET's request for an extension for the commencement of exports and in April, denied ET's appeal placing this project in Limbo. We have now been informed that ET has been in discussions with the DOE and is filing a new application for export authorization. ET expects to file in August and, during the DOE's review, work with existing customers, prospective equity investors, and other stakeholders to progress the development of the Lake Charles export facility. Ultimately I believe that ET will be granted the authorization because commodities are too important to the U.S. in global trade, and there will be a continuous need for U.S. energy on the global stage.The Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. and international markets. ET has made a final investment decision on an expansion to its NGL export capacity at the Nederland facility to address increased demand. They expect the expansion to cost $1.25 billion and add roughly 250,000 bpd of export capacity. ET also is pursuing a project at the Marcus Hook facility that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity.I am bullish on ET's future because as the demand for energy increases, so will the need for ET's services throughout the value chain. ET generates incremental profits throughout every segment in transporting crude, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Exporting could be a critical differentiator between ET and the rest of the sector in the future and allow ET to grow even quicker. If ET gains the approvals from the DOE it will expand their exporting capability and should drive higher volumes through their infrastructure due to contracted exports.ET goes  on 8/11, and the current distribution is larger than before the cut. In the November 2020 distribution, ET made a -50% reduction from $.305 to $0.1525. Since the February 2022 distribution, ET has provided unitholders with 7 consecutive quarterly distribution increases, bringing the annualized distribution to $1.24. On the conference call, management indicated that they will continue to target a 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate.If ET grows the distribution at a 4% rate which is the midpoint of their guidance, the annualized distribution could grow by 17% by the 2027 distribution. Management reduced its leverage, acquired 2 companies, and provided 7 distribution increases, bringing the distribution above its prior levels before the cuts in less than 3 years. ET is getting back to its roots and could become a distribution growth machine. I think between the new acquisitions and the potential export expansion, ET has the ability to provide larger increases to the distribution in the future and this is becoming an enticing yield story all over again.I updated all of the numbers for the MLPs I compare ET against, and they still look undervalued. I used the following MLPs in my peer group:ET trades at the lowest Adjusted EBITDA to market cap ratio in its peer group at 3.02x. The peer group average is 5.39, and units of ET still look to be on sale compared to this metric.ET's EV to Adjusted EBITDA is 7.89 compared to a 9.31 peer group average. PAA trades at a similar valuation then the rest of the group trade between 9.36x and 11.79x.When looking at the DCF that these companies generate compared to their market caps, ET trades at 4.66x compared to a 7.02x average.ET has the largest amount of debt, but they also produce the largest amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF. ET has a 3.74x total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which isn't that high even though it's the largest in the peer group.ET is also the largest-yielding MLP in the peer group, with a 9.73% yield compared to the peer group average of 7.98%.I still feel that ET is undervalued, considering you are paying 3.02x its market cap for ET's Adjusted EBITDA and 4.66x for its DCF. Today you would be getting the largest yielder out of the growth with a commitment to 3-5% in annual distribution growth at the lowest valuation. Oil and gas aren't going away, and with the global demand set to increase along with production in the U.S., ET's services will continue to see increased demand. If units continue to retrace in the coming weeks, I think the opportunity will just get stronger. I think ET deserves a stronger valuation, and eventually, the market will come around.

Boeing: Look Beyond Temporary Issues Towards Overall Trajectory,"The Boeing Company () is having trouble recovering to its past glory. The combination of problems revolving around 737 MAX and supply chain disruption due to the pandemic has created serious challenges for the company. Throughout the past fewBoeing is going through a temporary problem. Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems () found a  in the production of some Boeing 737 MAX planes. There were improperly drilled fastener holes in the aft pressure bulkhead. According to CFO Brian West during the , the current problem will impact 75% of the 220 planes in inventory, which is 165 planes.The problem certainly exists, and one may argue that these problems are hindrances to Boeing's future goals. However, I argue investors to look beyond what is likely a temporary hiccup, in my opinion.During the 2023 Industrial Conference, Boeing's CFO, Mr. Brian West, gave investors significant insight into the company's views for 2023 and beyond.Starting with 2023, despite the ongoing problems with Spirit AeroSystems, Mr. West has said that Boeing has ""a range of 400 to 450 for the 737 deliveries"" goal in 2023, and the company is ""not changing that range"" although it is likely for the delivery numbers to be in the lower range of this goal due to the ongoing problem. Further, the company continued to reiterate $3 - $5 billion in free cash flow for 2023.Thus, I believe this show of confidence could be interpreted as the ongoing problems surrounding Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are a near-term risk that will likely not have a major impact on Boeing's 2023 goals, let alone the company's longer-term vision.Further, despite the ongoing problems with 737 productions, the company has reiterated its plans to increase 787 production from 3 per month to 4 per month by the end of 2023 during the Industrial Conference.Overall, I believe the recent drop in Boeing stock is unwarranted. It is true that problems surrounding Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are significant and should have never happened. But, I believe the current problem is temporary, and it is unfair for Mr. Market to punish Boeing for something that could be overcome in the coming few quarters.The current problem may be temporary, but for Boeing to see future growth in both top-line and bottom-line, the company must drastically increase its delivery numbers. To address this,  737 MAX production from 31-38 per month to 50 per month, 787 production from 4 to 5 per month to 10 per month, and 777 production from 3 per month to 4 per month. These goals are expected to take place by 2025/2026, which is called the master schedule by the company.The successful execution of the master schedule is critical to Boeing and my bullish thesis, as the company's recovery and growth in the top and bottom line depends on this plan. Higher production volume impacting revenue is fairly obvious, so I will focus on the expected margins as these plans unfold.Boeing is eyeing recovery in 737 and 787 margins to 2018 levels in the coming years. Mr. West acknowledged that the margins on 737 and 787 today are lower than in 2018 driven by ""production rates [being] lower now than they were"" in 2018. Also, the company has ""two dual factories that we've had to stand up to support the inventoried airplanes on both the 87 and the 37,"" which were impacting margins. However, going forward, as inventories continue to trickle down and production rates increase, these problems could be behind Boeing. More concretely, Mr. West guided for a 737 margin rate in line with 2018 and a 787 margin rate higher than 2018 due to favorable model 10 mixes.I believe this argument to be reasonable. If no inventories are dragging the company while higher production volume creates lower unit costs, it is natural for the company's margins to improve. But, is it realistic?In my opinion, the answer is yes. Although there were numerous bumps in progress, the company has been consistently showing progress and delivery number increases since 737 MAX re-certification as the chart below shows. I believe this shows the company's ability to execute, and also, the fact that the company continues to guide and update the progress toward their master schedule shows confidence. Thus, as of today, I believe the company's production goals are realistic.[Chart created by author using: , , ]Overall, as I believe Boeing is moving in the right direction, I am bullish on the company. However, there are some risks involved in investing in Boeing.First, investors should closely monitor the company's progress in increasing its delivery numbers in the company's upcoming earnings report on October 25th. My bullish thesis revolves around the company's progress towards achieving high-volume production in the near future; thus, any implications from the management team that may hint at a significant delay to such a future could pose a significant risk to the thesis.Further, due to the prolonged grounding of 737 MAX, Boeing's financial health or its  is not in the optimal position today. Boeing, as of 2023Q2, has a total asset of about $134 billion with a higher total liability at about $150 billion, bringing the company's total liability to asset ratio to about 112%. A big chunk of the company's liability comes from long-term debt, which stands at about $48 billion, bringing the company's interest expense for the first half of the year to about $1.27 billion. Thus, any major hindrance to Boeing's progress to achieve higher volume production may continue to strain an already fragile balance sheet.Boeing has been through a lot in the past few years. Everything from the 737 MAX crisis and the supply chain disruption due to the pandemic following years of grounding has created major hurdles. However, although there are some near-term problems with Boeing's operations and ambition to grow production, the company is moving and progressing in the right direction. Boeing continues to guide a production target that has been laid out for the past few quarters despite the current near-term challenge, while providing confidence for the company's ambitious schedule to dramatically increase production levels that can bring increased margins in the coming years. Therefore, I believe Boeing is a buy.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Barrick: Fool's Gold,"It has been some time since we wrote about Barrick Gold Corporation (). We tend to keep our trades reserved for the Marketplace Service and the last one involved us selling our positions out for a .That was on January 31, 2023, and the stock has done terribly since then. That is on an absolute performance basis, as well as relative to the S&P 500 () and VanEck Gold Miners ETF ().We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to haveThe last released quarter was actually not bad at all. Barrick got the benefit of higher Gold prices and a higher production level relative to Q1-2023.Barrick then went on to hit the trifecta with lower cost of sales and lower cash costs. Anyone who has followed Barrick's history for any length of time knows that it is pretty rare for Barrick to hit all of these in the same quarter. In fact, in the same graphic above, you can see the deterioration if you switch to a year-over-year view.One remarkable aspect of this is the fact that Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022 and oil prices and all other commodity prices spiked in the second quarter of 2022. All raw material costs for items used in mining are lower relative to that quarter. And yet, Barrick shows the higher cost of sales, cash costs, and all-in sustaining costs, relative to that of Q2-2022. As we have , this is a slow motion train-wreck of escalating costs, that never ever stops.The latest 10-year Gold and Copper production outlook disclosed in September was as follows.Gold production is expected to be about flat with 4.1 million ounces expected all the way to the end of the decade. In 2020, the outlook was for 4.5 million ounces.Ok, that is not a big drop. Only 10% is peanuts for this business. But let us look further back. Barrick's biggest acquisition was Randgold Resources that brought the highly revered Mark Bristow to the forefront of the combined operation. When the two (Barrick Gold and Randgold Resources) merged or rather were about to merge, their combined production So 6.0 million ounces of gold turned to 4.5 million ounces and that turned into a target of 4.1 million ounces. Ok, that is a 33% drop. But let us go past that as well. In 2006, Barrick as a stand-alone company produced 8.643 million ounces at a cash cost of $280 an ounce.Riveting right?So when you whine and grumble that no institutional investor has love for Barrick, it is probably because they have spent some time actually reading the financial statements.Ok, so the longer-term case is the same. Grinding down production with escalating costs, punctuated with new presentations showing how the future will be radically different than the past. That is why the chart looks like this. Note we have shown the return and total return (including dividends) below.If you bought Barrick for leverage over gold prices, well that is how it has worked out. But in shorter timeframes, Barrick does look incredibly oversold.The price is significantly below its 200-day moving average and the same can be seen for GDX as well.Gold itself has been falling in response to a stronger US Dollar and sentiment levels are reaching extremes that are usually associated with a meaningful bottom. Gold tends to do better as we end September, but so far that bounce has been missing in action.We think a bottom is due shortly, and we will likely get a rip-roaring rally to reset sentiment.  After that it should be business as usual.It is very hard to make a long-term investing case for Barrick. The only reason we made positive returns was due to utilizing the high option premiums for covered calls that buffered things for us. The stock was actually lower when we sold it versus when we first bought it, but all those premiums saved us from losses. The lesson learned was that you cannot squeeze blood from stone and some asset classes are best just traded, rather than used as investments. If you have a retort there somewhere, feast your eyes on the XAU, the Gold and Silver Index, which sits 35% below its 1990 level.Lots of trades there in that chart and there are some amazing experts who can navigate those turns. But it is not one for the believers. You know the ones that think the US Dollar will go to zero and gold will go to infinity. Even those believers are better off buying actual bullion for the long haul. Gold miners in general and Barrick in particular, remain poor ways to leverage that thesis. If you really have to wade here, then consider the royalty plays like Royal Gold () which actually do create long-term value for shareholders. Buy for a trade and then hit the fade. targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety. The volatility of these investments is further lowered .

"Superior Industries: Mill Road Keeps Buying, Should You?","Superior Industries () is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (""OEM"") producing aluminum wheels for vehicles in North America and Europe. The company's balance sheet is complex, and the business has suffered from leverage issues as well as low auto productionSuperior was founded in 1957 but their leverage problem is new. From 2002-2016, Superior had no net debt, but they levered up in 2017 to gain European exposure throughMost production takes place in Mexico and Poland, with limited operations in Germany. Superior believes their footprint is well-situated to take advantage of . They own their manufacturing locations and should be able to tap these for liquidity via sale-leasebacks if traditional financing becomes too expensive for their business. If land and buildings were sold near their book cost of $150m, and leased back at 8-10% annually, Superior would retain more flexibility to deal with maturities. Based on commentary , some rationalization in Europe is likely incoming:Superior has about 27m shares outstanding, which currently trade at ~$3.50/share - roughly a $100m market capitalization. Superior also carries a $399m term loan, €217m of senior notes (~$236m @ 6/30/23), and $5m other debt against $181m of cash for $458m net debt. Lastly, they have preferred stock, convertible at $28/share with an initial value of $150m, redeemable after September 2025 for $300m in cash or a maximum of 5.3m shares.If we value the preferred at the full $300m, the total Enterprise Value (""EV"") is $100m + $458m +$300m = $858m, which is what it would take to buy the full company today before any equity premium and not giving them any credit for significant owned real estate.Superior is guiding to a midpoint of $180m Adjusted EBITDA (4.8x EV/EBITDA), $120m of cash from operations in 2022 and $65m of CapEx. Subtracting another $14m for preferred dividends, 2023 free cash flow to equity should be $41m at the midpoint, about a 40% yield to common shareholders and unleveraged yield is almost 15%. Given current auto supply is not exactly at all-time highs, these metrics are not very demanding on what are hopefully depressed earnings. This guidance also suggests they will reverse the negative FCF YTD, due to some fluctuations in aluminum payables (per Q2 call).I dislike making macro calls, I.e., predicting the direction of automobile manufacturing. My goal here is to show that I think the most likely direction for demand for Superior's products is up.There is a relative lack of vehicles in the US currently, and I expect the result of this to be demand for wheels to remain steady or increase.  also remain far below pre-covid levels. If new vehicles are prohibitively expensive, then hopefully this will increase aftermarket demand (though it is only ~6% of Superior's business). GM, Ford, and VW represented  respectively, making their production a key driver for Superior investors.There have been looming talks of a , which could certainly harm Superior's main customers.Auto suppliers are generally not great businesses, and I wouldn't be surprised if Superior trades near 5x EBITDA going forward, but there is upside to the stock if it maintains the current multiple.If FY24 EBITDA can hit $200m with European restructuring and no additional growth, and the stock trades at 4.5x, the resulting $900m EV would only be a $42m accretion to the current EV but would have the tailwind of reduced leverage from cash generated by the business, and all that accretion goes to the equity. Between debt paydown and EBITDA growth, the current share price could easily double to $7 in this scenario.If we advance to FY25, when the 6% senior notes will be due and the preferred stock will be callable, Superior appears on track to pay the notes off in full or refinance a portion. Interestingly, in this scenario, Superior may be able to settle the preferred using only the 5.3m shares it is redeemable for.Assumptions:In FY19, Superior was able to sell about 19m wheels against 35m vehicles produced in Europe and North America, earning EBITDA of almost $9/wheel. In FY22, earnings had improved such that 15m wheels earned about $12.50/wheel with vehicle production down about 10% from FY19. If we assume Superior can recover to 2019 production levels, but maintain their better earnings per wheel ($12.50-$15/wheel), FY25 EBITDA could be $250-300m. I would expect with higher factory utilization, margins would increase to the top of this range, but the amount of production Superior can recover remains to be seen.It seems possible the stock could trade at 7x EBITDA if there is a clear path to eliminating the preferred overhang and leverage is back below 2x EBITDA. Therefore, 7 * 300m = $2.1B EV, less $400m debt plus $150m of cash generated is $1.85B valuation/32.5m shares after conversion = $57/share. This is a blue-sky scenario, but maybe not as outlandish as you would expect for a stock trading under $4 today. This kind of outcome could also be part of some kind compromise with TPG to remove the overhang sooner.If I'm going to suggest a stock has this much potential upside, there must be some risks.Superior's acquisition of UNIWHEELS in 2017 led to significant growth in revenues and EBITDA, but the complexity of its capital structure, including the redeemable preferred stock deal, presents a hurdle to overcome before the 2025 debt and convertible preferred stock maturities. This provides opportunities for the company to unlock value for its shareholders as maturities approach. Monitoring the evolving automobile landscape will be essential for potential investors. Tailwinds to the industry may be extremely favorable for Superior shareholders, and Mill Road is seizing the moment.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Civitas Resources: More Than Half Its Production Now Comes From The Permian,"Civitas Resources () has remade itself after a series of acquisitions. Slightly over half of its total production is expected to come from the Permian after its latest $2.1 billion  acquisition.All these acquisitions have resulted inCivitas is projected to generate close to $1.5 billion in free cash flow in 2024 at the current strip. It should be able to reduce its debt to a bit over $4.2 billion at the end of 2024, while also paying out around $7 per share in base plus variable dividends.I now estimate Civitas's value at around $86 per share in a long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas environment.CivitasCivitas is paying $1 billion in cash (subject to purchase price adjustments) at deal close along with 7.3 million shares. Another $550 million in cash is due in January 2025, although this will be reduced to $500 million if Civitas chooses to pay this additional amount at the closing date (expected in early 2024). Civitas is paying a high-single digits interest rate on its borrowings, so it would save a modest amount (net of additional interest costs) if it paid $500 million upon closing.Civitas expects the production from the acquired assets to decline a bit from current levels in 2024, which should also help cash flow a bit. It expects roughly 55,000 BOEPD (46% oil) in 2024 production, along with approximately $750 million EBITDA at $80 WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX gas in 2024. With $400 million in projected capex for these assets, that would leave $350 million in asset-level free cash flow for these assets.At the current 2024 strip of $75 to $76 WTI oil along with around $3.60 NYMEX, 2024 EBITDA would be reduced to around $715 million, resulting in $315 million in free cash flow. The purchase price is thus 2.95x 2024 EBITDA (at current strip) and the free cash flow yield is approximately 15%.Overall the Vencer deal appears to be fairly typical of the current market in terms of pricing and multiples. Civitas mentions that around 80% of the purchase price is attributable to the proved developed reserves, which suggests a 0.9x multiple to PD PV-10 (at three-year strip) plus around $1 million per gross location for inventory.If the Vencer acquisition closes at the start of 2024, Civitas expects to average around 335,000 BOEPD in production during 2024. This includes 160,000 barrels per day in oil production. Civitas's production mix would be approximately 48% oil, 25% NGLs, and 27% natural gas.Slightly over half of Civitas's 2024 oil production is coming from its Permian assets. The narrower Permian oil differential should reduce its overall company oil differential to under $3 per barrel.Current strip is around $75 to $76 WTI oil along with around $3.60 NYMEX gas. At those commodity prices, Civitas is expected to generate $5.544 billion in oil and gas revenues, while its 2024 hedges have around negative $34 million in value. Civitas's hedging position was last reported as of the end of July 2023.For 2024, it appears that Civitas's cash opex could end up slightly under $10 per BOE. This includes lease operating expense, GT&P expense, midstream expense, and cash G&A.Civitas also expects approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures after its Vencer acquisition.This results in a projection of $1.488 billion in free cash flow for Civitas at the current strip. This doesn't include the potential impact of cash income taxes for Civitas. It doesn't expect to pay cash taxes in 2023 but does not appear to have mentioned 2024 expectations yet.Civitas mentioned expecting approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow at $80 WTI oil, but the current oil strip is around $4 to $5 lower than that now. I have also assumed that Civitas will largely fund the cash portion of the Vencer acquisition by issuing additional notes (discussed more below), which would increase Civitas's interest costs.Civitas had approximately $3.8 billion in net debt at the end of Q2 2023, proforma for its Tap Rock and Hibernia acquisitions that closed in August.Proforma for its Vencer acquisition, it may end 2023 with approximately $5 billion in net debt (including deferred consideration).I expect Civitas to issue additional notes to help fund the Vencer acquisition, so I am modeling things as if Civitas adds $500 million in 2028 notes and $500 million in 2031 notes as tack-on offerings.This would leave Civitas with $4.1 billion in outstanding notes and $900 million in credit facility debt at the end of 2023.Civitas now has approximately 101 million outstanding shares, so its $0.50 per share quarterly dividend adds up to around $202 million per year. It may also pay around $5 per share in variable dividends in 2024, adding up to around $505 million in variable dividends. Civitas's variable dividend is based on trailing 12-month free cash flow, so it will take a bit of time for its acquisitions to fully affect its variable dividend.This leaves $781 million for debt reduction and share repurchases. If Civitas puts that all towards debt reduction, it would end 2024 with around $4.22 billion in net debt or leverage of around 1.1x. This is higher than Civitas's 0.9x leverage projection, which was done based on $80 WTI oil.Civitas has also mentioned a target of $300 million in non-core asset sales by mid-2024.I now estimate Civitas's value at approximately $86 per share at my long-term commodity price estimates of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. This translates into a 3.25x EV to unhedged EBITDA multiple based on Civitas's 2024 production levels and projected year-end 2024 net debt.At $86 per share, Civitas should also be able to deliver a 12% to 13% free cash flow yield at $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas while maintaining production levels. This also assumes that Civitas is a full cash income taxpayer. Without cash income taxes, its free cash flow yield would be closer to 16% in this scenario.Civitas has significantly increased its production through a series of Permian acquisitions, of which the $2.1 billion Vencer acquisition is the most recent one. Civitas now has slightly over 50% of its production coming from the Permian.This has increased its net debt to around $5 billion after its most recent acquisition, although its overall leverage still appears to be acceptable. Civitas may be able to generate close to $1.5 billion in free cash flow in 2024 at mid-$70s WTI oil. This would allow it to pay $7 per share in total dividends while also paying down its debt by over $750 million.I estimate Civitas's value at around $86 per share in a long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas environment. Civitas's production is around 48% oil, so it is somewhat sensitive to the price of natural gas and NGLs.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

AMD And Nvidia: Engagements Vs. Invoices,"There's a pretty intense debate around  () ability to compete with  () in the artificial intelligence, or AI, space, especially in the data center sector. And the former is chasing the latterTheNow, just because Nvidia has a head start with its product doesn't mean AMD can't come on the scene, rip some wins out of the hands of Nvidia, and steal the show. It can certainly happen - though, there's a software aspect to it that I'll discuss later.The problem is there's no real way to know at this point, and ""engagements"" are about as cheap as water from the ocean.But what are engagements, exactly?According to Lisa Su, they're customer ""programs"" with the intention of deploying its MI line of AI accelerators (emphasis added):In the business world, this is the very first level of working with a potential vendor or customer (depending on which perspective you're coming from). To ""engage"" with a vendor means to get more information about what it can provide and go as far as getting its hands on the product to mock a proof of concept. Proof of concepts can take anywhere from a month to six months or longer before any business decisions are made; it all depends on the complexity of what's being proven.These engagements are what Nvidia had to do over a year ago when it began sampling its H100 accelerator. Those engagements have turned into invoices. But before I get too far down the road, I'll map out where AMD is right now on the timeline.With MI300 production not starting till Q4, the volume ramp will trail into 2024. So while the mass production of the product begins, it won't have sufficient inventory to sell until a few months later once it ramps. Then there's the delivery to the customer and the installation and setup thereafter. If AMD is just now having proof of concepts shipped, there's a minimum of three-to-six months before these companies decide to purchase. Moreover, AMD is only providing ""early system access"" to its  customers - not all of them.So even the engagements are only turning into proof of concepts with its lead customers. Those lead customers will likely apply the most scrutiny to their proof of concept. However, if they approve, the remaining customers may be more comfortable with their proof of concept. But with AI, the product must work for each of them specifically, so there are very few shortcuts to the evaluation.But more to the point, if only initial lead customers are evaluating, the number of customers lining up to order will be thin come Q4. Furthermore, this puts the purchase decision late in the fourth quarter. Delivery and installation will not likely occur until Q1 '24 once volume production allows for shipment. From there, widespread availability may not come until Q2 '24.This is corroborated by  in the tech space (emphasis added):With engagements only happening now, it means no revenue for the next two quarters, at the very least, with the third quarter beginning to show some receipts. So the process for AMD to turn engagements into invoices is nowhere near where the market would like it to be. Incremental revenue gains in the data center segment for MI300 won't happen until Q1 '24 at best.To move into the more speculative side for a moment, these engagements may also be a red herring altogether. In my assessment above, I'm giving the benefit of the doubt AMD will see these engagements turn into invoices. They instead may be cloud and AI customers trying to find other solutions to Nvidia's H100 package because they can't order enough H100s to fulfill their AI needs. After all, Nvidia admitted to ramping volume up more than it was to satisfy demand in 2H '23. So these customers kick the tires with the only other vendor in the field to see if they have something to offer to supplement their AI needs.Ultimately, these customers may find the alternate solution in their proof of concept unworkable or too costly to implement. You might be thinking, ""How can it be too costly? Nvidia's H100 setup is the most expensive thing a cloud provider can buy right now."" While this is true, this is where software comes in. Another solution requiring more software integration and several new software components may require more labor (development time) to get to a workable solution. This is TCO - total cost of ownership.With Nvidia's accelerator, customers are getting its proprietary package. Some may say this is the exact problem. However, it's also a supported solution where Nvidia is incentivized to work with its customers to tweak the software because it can provide the most expertise, and its customers become entrenched. AMD is working toward an open-source software solution. While this sounds free and broad-community supported, it also requires a lot of customization to tailor it to the customer's needs. And much of that lands on the customer to figure out.Even beyond my skepticism, AMD admits its software path will be long. Cloud customers don't have ""long"" (emphasis added):And AMD is open-sourcing because it cannot work on the software solely internally, either because of a lack of talent or dedicated resources, or both.Nvidia has been working on its software for over 16 years (with CUDA), while its AI package has been around arguably since 2017. This has made Nvidia a software powerhouse and not just a hardware engineering company. AMD's reliance on open-source software, which is all-new, requires it to make the same inroads while also dealing with the open-source community to advance the software. There are certainly advantages to open-source software; I use them every day. But for the biggest customers in the world, a proven and minimal configurable-intensive solution is what moves business forward. AMD has  been a follower in software, while Nvidia has been a leader, and this is still the difference between the two.Engagements are a far cry from revenue, especially without a proven product. Sure, benchmarks here and there may show AMD's MI300 beating out the H100 in certain aspects and certain tests, especially on the memory side. However, pure hardware performance is nothing more than a paperweight (a very expensive one) without software. And Nvidia maintains a significant lead in software for GPUs and AI compute.Also, none of this addresses Nvidia readying its next-generation product just as AMD is at full production levels. It will put AMD behind again in hardware before it ever gets going.In March of next year,  (believed to be called Blackwell) will be launched. This would put Nvidia, without question, back on top of the hardware side. I expect Nvidia will up its memory game and procure Micron's () , which will put to rest any questions about Nvidia's accelerator's ability to keep up in the memory bandwidth bottleneck game. The timing aligns for Micron's product release of early CY24 with a likely Hopper-Next Q4 '24/Q1 '25 release.Overall, I wouldn't be too excited about AMD's AI data center prospects. Its MI300 is only in the engagement phase of the sales cycle, while Nvidia is finalizing its Hopper-Next accelerator architecture. Once AMD overcomes the ""long journey"" in software, I'll be all ears. Until then, AMD's revenue may be incremental to the recovery in data center as a whole - if it ever recovers to the same levels, which I doubt - as GPUs begin to take over the data center architecture, pulling CPU demand down for AMD and Intel () over the next few years.Do two things to further your tech portfolio.

Antero Resources: Profit From The Nat Gas Bull Market,"Antero Resources () is my favourite stock to gain exposure to natural gas prices.It stands out in terms of recent performance and has a compelling valuation. Furthermore, AR does not hedge for gas prices, so this means thatFrom a TA perspective, we could have initiated a 1-2 set-up that will take us towards $40 over the next few years.Antero's revenue saw a significant blow compared to last year's quarter. Its revenue is down 61.86% to $937.40 Million from $2.4 Billion YoY. The company's net income (loss) stood at -$83 Million, down 110% from net income of $765.14 Million last year's same quarter. Antero reported an EBITDA of $106.61 Million, declining by 91% from 1.26 Billion in the same quarter the previous year. Similarly, its EPS was also down by a significant margin, standing at -$0.28, down 116% from $1.68. Although these numbers don't paintAs mentioned earlier, the company's most of the exploration sites are in the Appalachian Basin. So the company provided an update in its earnings report and Antero leads its Appalachian peers in well productivity trends and, importantly, continues to increase its liquids productivity. The company said they increased their completion stages by 93% since 2019, and in March, they achieved 16 stages per day. Its drilling efficiency at sites has also increased by 52% since 2019, showing promising progress. Antero's drill out 2795 feet per day in 2019; in March 2023, it hit a daily record of 6450 feet. They also reduced their cycle time per pad by a significant margin. Cycle time represents days from the surface spud to the first production date. So, in 2019, it was around 427 days; in March 2023, it was reduced by a significant margin to 129 days.The company mentioned enhanced production forecasts and reduced anticipated maintenance costs. It also mentioned improvements in drilling and completion, paired with robust well outcomes, lead to elevated production levels and decreased maintenance capital requirements. Production guidance increased by 3%, and maintenance capital was reduced by 10%. Antero's U.S. propane exports hit a record high in 2023, setting a weekly record on June 23, 2023, of 1.895 MMBbl/d.Right now is a great time to begin investing in gas, in my opinion.Natural gas will be a key player in the global energy transition, and US gas will play an important role. The US boasts a high supply of gas but cannot make the most out of it due to limitations in its transportation infrastructure.As we can see above, LNG capacity is drastically being built out in the next few years to address this issue.This will allow US companies to take advantage of the current price differential.On the other hand, AR is a great way to gain exposure to the gas price, because the company does not hedge its production. This means investors will be fully exposed to an appreciation in gas prices.Antero Resources holds a distinctive position in the competitive landscape of energy resources. Its forward Price-to-Earnings ratio stands at 28.33, and its trailing twelve months at 5.38. These numbers suggest a market optimism regarding Antero's prospective earnings, especially when juxtaposed against peers like Southwestern Energy, with a notably low forward P/E of 2.76.Antero's Price-to-Sales ratio of 1.09 aligns closely with most of its competitors, barring Southwestern's () notably lower 0.63, which might hint at its undervaluation or possible revenue challenges. As indicated by the Price-to-Book ratio, Antero's 1.36 is moderate regarding asset valuation. It's less optimistic than Range's () or Matador's () nor as cautious as Civitas's () or Permian's (), which hover below 1.Leverage-wise, Antero's Total Debt to Total Equity ratio of 68.55 strikes a middle ground, being more conservative than Southwestern's high 105.62 but less than Civitas's lower ratio. Growth metrics further illuminate Antero's position with a 3-year revenue CAGR of 26.99% and a 5-year CAGR of 14.45%. Though solid, it's outpaced by Civitas's remarkable 3-year CAGR of 131.98%.Finally, regarding profitability, Antero's Return on Equity stands at 23.71%. While this indicates efficient capital management, it's shadowed by Southwestern's staggering 146.60% and Range's impressive 63.34%.With its specific valuation figures, Antero Resources carves out a balanced niche within its industry. Antero is fairly valued compared to its energy sector peers. It's neither undervalued nor overvalued. Its debt-to-equity ratio shows that the company's debt is moderate, meaning it has not overly relied on debt.Antero has reported a significant drop in earnings despite the rising oil and gas prices. Since the company announced its quarterly results, its stock has been on a roller coaster ride, presenting a mixed picture. Its numbers don't impress the investors, but its operations at Appalachian Basin sites are gaining investors' attention, so the stock has not dropped significantly.Antero has generated an EPS of $4.44 in the last year. The company expects to grow its earnings by 574% next year, increasing its EPS from $0.28 to $2.90. Currently, the company is not offering dividends, especially when the sector offers a median yield of 3.57%. It is not a better pick for investors seeking a passive income stock. But Antero shows potential growth for investors willing to take risks.Antero's P/S TTM ratio is 1.09, marginally below the sector's 1.35, while its forward ratio of 1.58 is slightly above the sector's 1.52. Its P/B ratios, both TTM and forward ratios, are 1.06 and 1.05, respectively. Both are lower than the sector medians, which shows it is undervalued according to its assets.From a technical perspective, Antero looks like a good buy right now:We have completed an impulse from the May lows, and the stock has managed to retrace close to 61.8% from its high. We have seen a strong impulse form from there, which gives me confidence that a 1-2 set-up could be in place.Based on this analysis, we could have now begun a rally towards +$40, which is the 1.618 ext of wave 1 measured from the bottom of wave 2.Like any other resources company, Antero also has potential threats that it could face. It ranges from threats that could arise within the company, industry or factors that aren't in its control and can affect from outside.Companies operating in the energy sector are prone to commodity price fluctuations, which can significantly affect their revenue. Operational risk is also important to a resource company, as hazards could sometimes arise. If we look at Antero's debt-to-equity ratio, it indicates significant debt, which could make it vulnerable during an economic downturn.One other important factor is the decline in its reserves. The value of the resource company is often subject to the reserves it owns. If its reserves start to deplete, its value could drop if it doesn't explore reserves to create new revenue streams. So, for Antero, it's important to regularly engage in exploring new reserves.The oil and gas market is competitive, and for Antero to stay relevant in the game, it should always have a competitive edge to stay ahead. Other potential risks could be technological challenges, Dependence on the leadership, infrastructure constraints, legal and litigation risks, and economic downturns.Antero is well-positioned in the energy sector after analyzing the ratios, risks, and relevance. It shows a balanced valuation when compared to its peers in the industry. The nature of the energy sector is volatile and has imminent risks. The company's debt, although not extreme, still is a threat in an economic downturn. Lastly, its survival is based on its reserves, so it's good that Antero continuously explores new reserves and secures its future to create value for its investors.This is a high-risk/high-reward opportunity, which is exactly what I look for in my YOLO portfolio.Join the Pragmatic Investor today to get insight into stocks with You will also get:- Weekly Macro newsletter- Access to the End of The World and YOLO portfolios- Trade Ideas- Weekly VideoJames Foord is an economist by trade and has been analyzing global markets for the past decade.

Ring Energy: Capable Of Generating $80 Million In Free Cash Flow In 2024,"Ring Energy () looks to be a decent value at $1.75 per share now, which I believe prices in high-$60s WTI oil in the longer term. At my long-term oil price of $75 WTI, I am keeping Ring does have hedges covering around 40% of its oil production in 2024 and the first half of 2025, and its hedges have around negative $19 million in estimated value over that period. I still expect Ring to be able to generate around $80 million in free cash flow in 2024 at current strip (just above $80 oil) despite its hedges, which works out to slightly over $0.40 per share in free cash flow. This would be around a 23% free cash flow yield at Ring's current share price.Ring issued 63.9 million shares to Stronghold Energy's owners in 2022 as part of the consideration for that acquisition. Stronghold was mostly owned by Warburg Pincus.There were  distributed to other Stronghold owners, leaving Warburg Pincus in control of 59.6 million Ring shares. Of these shares, 13.5 million were recently sold, leaving Warburg Pincus with around 46.1 million shares.Further sales of Ring's stock by Warburg Pincus may weigh on its share price at times, but overall I think Ring's assets are worth more than its current share price indicates.Ring's 2024 hedges have an estimated value of negative $16 million at current strip prices. It has oil hedges covering approximately 43% of its 2024 oil production if its oil production remains at Q4 2023 levels (based on guidance midpoint).Ring's 2025 hedges have around negative $3 million in estimated value, and it may have around 39% of its 1H 2025 oil production (also based on Q4 2023 production levels) hedged.Thus Ring still appears to have a decent amount of exposure to oil price upside although it is roughly 40% hedged on oil in 2024 and the first half of 2025.Ring is required to hedge 50% of its projected production from PDP wells on a rolling 24 month basis until it gets its borrowing base utilization below 50% and its leverage to 1.25x or below.Ring had $395 million in net debt at the end of Q2 2023. At current strip prices it may be able to reduce this to around $360 million by the end of 2023 assuming there are no changes to other working capital items. With a $600 million borrowing base, Ring would need to reduce its borrowings by at least $60 million more to reach the 50% requirement. At high-$70s oil, Ring's leverage should be 1.25x or less with $300 million in net debt as well.Ring's Q4 2023 production is expected to be around 19,200 BOEPD (69% oil). I am modeling its 2024 production at a similar level for now.The current strip for 2024 is slightly above $80 WTI oil. This results in a projection that Ring can generate $388 million in revenues after hedges in 2024.I've assumed that Ring can maintain production at 19,200 BOEPD in 2024 with a $155 million capital expenditure budget.Ring's credit facility debt has an interest rate based on SOFR plus 3% to 4%, so with SOFR around 5.3%, Ring's interest rate would be 8.3% to 9.3% depending on its level of borrowings. Thus its cash interest expense may be around $30 million in 2024.Ring is projected to generate $80 million in free cash flow in 2024 at current strip while maintaining production. This is around $0.40 per share in free cash flow.I am keeping my estimate of Ring's value at $2.85 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil. At its current share price it seems to be fairly valued for a high-$60s long-term oil scenario.At $2.85 per share, Ring should be able to generate a 13% to 14% unhedged free cash flow yield at $75 WTI oil and with $30 million per year in cash interest costs. This also assumes no cash income taxes. Ring has a substantial amount of NOL carryforwards that should cover its net income for several years.Ring Energy appears capable of generating around $80 million in free cash flow in 2024 at current strip prices. If it puts that towards debt reduction and doesn't do any more acquisitions, it could reduce its borrowing base utilization rate below 50% and see lowered hedging requirements as a result.I believe that Ring's current share price is pricing in high-$60s WTI oil and that it at long-term $75 WTI oil instead it could be worth $2.85 per share. To get to that price, Ring may need to show that it can achieve substantial debt reduction though. It appears capable of reducing its net debt to around $280 million by the end of 2024 at current strip.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Mesabi Trust Looks Attractive With Estimated Forward Yield Of 8.2% To 11.4%," () generally passes through to shareholders the income it receives from the company's iron ore royalties. It sold off hard after Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. () CEO Lourenco Goncalves forced theAs I highlighted in my most , he did try to continue to lean on the trust by floating a thinly veiled threat to use the mine as a swing operation going forward:I didn't buyMeanwhile, Mesabi  on October 13th. Meanwhile, we have another  as well, and it has become clear that the mining is being put to good use. During the three months ending July 31, 2023, iron ore pellets production at Northshore from Mesabi Trust Lands totaled 1,049,281 tons. This translated into the following royalties received:If you would extrapolate the above royalties received for a full year, it adds up to $2.8 per unit.I understand the maximum capacity of the mine is something like  per annum. The mine has solid reserves. I expect I won't be around when it finally runs out. Given that the mine started in April or May, production is pretty good.A dividend of $0.35 on a stock price of $20 isn't that impressive. However, it is just an initial distribution. Meanwhile, iron ore prices are pretty good, especially with China having been in such a rut lately.Iron ore prices don't translate exactly into dividend payout. The royalty structure is complicated. There are bonuses for annual production levels and price thresholds. However, the dividend does follow iron prices reasonably well (with a bit of lag), as may be expected:I'd expect a normalized dividend rate in the $1.80-$2.50 range at current iron ore prices. This year, it will be lower, but as soon as a big quarterly dividend is paid, I expect investors to start extrapolating it a few years out. The recent share price appears like the market is pricing in larger future dividends, but it could also be due to iron ore strength.China appears to be changing its tune and initiated  Measures include policies targeting the construction sector. Construction is the primary market for iron ore and China is generally 70% of global iron ore demand.Mesabi stock isn't super cheap, but it is still only back at the same price as when I wrote my last article. The royalty model benefits from high inflation, as it in essence charges a percentage of iron ore prices to the producer. In an inflationary environment (you could consider this one), this type of income vehicle should look quite attractive compared to bonds. My dividend range estimate effectively translates into a normalized annualized forward yield of 8.2% to 11.4%(full production over a full year). The income is volatile, but over the long term, it should be well protected against inflation because the distributions follow the iron ore price. Higher iron ore prices generally mean higher distributions.Check out the  report if you are interested in uncorrelated returns.

EQT: Strong Value Potential In Healthy Natural Gas Market,"Natural gas has faced an incredibly tumultuous period over the past two years. Natural gas prices initially skyrocketed in 2021 due to shortages created during COVID-19 lockdown production cuts. The commodity continued to rise in 2022 as the Russia-Ukraine war ledBullish investors in natural gas have multiple options. The natural gas futures ETF () is one option, but it often chronically underperforms due to harmful contangoHistorically, both EQT's price and cash flow per share correlate to the futures price of natural gas. Usually, some portion of EQT's production is hedged, so its correlation to natural gas is not perfect. Last year, it had solid cash flows due to the high price of natural gas. However, gas has crashed to extreme lows since then, pushing its operating cash flow to near-zero levels. Despite this, EQT's share price remains nearly the same level during the 2022 peak. See below:EQT did not entirely benefit from 2022 natural gas prices due to its hedge ceilings last year, making its profit outlook today nearly equal to its profits in 2022. Many factors may impact the company, mainly changes in production costs and natural gas prices. Natural gas is relatively cheap today but is more stable as its production outlook stagnates. Overall, I expect natural gas prices to stabilize around the $3-$3.5 level in 2024, given the trend in the natural gas rig count; however, upcoming winter weather conditions will play a key role in its 2024 pricing.Most of EQT's 2023 production is  of around $4.25/MMBTU level, while, at the end of Q2, 30% of its 2024 production was hedged at $3.64/MMBTU.  of its output varies from around $2/MMBTU to $3/MMBTU across its portfolio. Thus, looking into its 2024 potential, we will need to closely monitor that range to determine its ability to generate a profit. We know that nearly a third of its portfolio is hedged and at a slightly profitable level. Still, given that natural gas has held the $2-$3 range this year, the company will unlikely continue to hedge its 2024 production.The 2024  contracts are trading at ~$3.4/MMBTU, up by around $1/MMBTU over recent months, putting pricing back into a firmly profitable range for the company. The rise in natural gas prices may likely result from the sharp decline in the rig count, associated with profit declines amongst most US natural gas producers. That said, total US natural gas production remains very strong today. See below:As stated in its , this ""breakeven"" level includes capital costs, corporate overhead, taxes, and other key expenses. Over the first half of 2023, EQT had 883K MMcf in sales volume, or ~1.83B MMBTU annualized. That said, the company expects  Mcfe in total 2023 production, so I will project its 2024 production at 2.02B MMBTU,  was hedged at the end of Q2 at a weighted-average floor of $3.64. Assuming an all-in breakeven of around $2.5/MMBTU, we can expect around $728M in profits from its hedged position. Further, if natural gas remains around $3.4 (based on 2024 average contracts, marginal profit of ~$0.9/MMBTU), its total profit on unhedged positions should be around $1.24B. Together, its full natural gas expected profit is ~$1.97B. Accounting for oil, NGL, ethane, and other products, which usually account for 10% or less of its revenue, I expect combined segment profits of ~$2.1B.The variability in profit potential is significant at potentially +/- $1B, given no change in commodity prices but variation in production costs across its operating segments. Its Pro Forma free-cash-flow breakeven cost , meaning it should earn around $952M in FCF on its hedged position and ~$1.65B on its non-hedged position, assuming no change in commodity prices and production costs. Together, adding potential FCF from other segments, I forecast its 2024 FCF at ~$2.7B based on these assumptions.Given that income and FCF target, EQT is likely not overpriced at a market capitalization of $16.9B, giving it a forward ""P/FCF"" of around 6.25X. This is a reasonable, if not low, valuation for EQT. The reality is that EQT missed out on profits in 2022 due to hedge positions. It is less hedged going forward and should earn a decent profit, given natural gas prices do not decline significantly. I would not say EQT is  undervalued today because small changes in natural gas prices could substantially impact its forward profit potential. That said, given I am slightly bullish on natural gas, I believe EQT may be a superior tool than ETF like UNG to speculate on higher natural gas prices.The upcoming winter will be essential for EQT, given the small ongoing glut in the US natural gas market. The surge in expected LNG demand from Europe and high natural gas prices caused many US producers to overdevelop in 2022, leading to ongoing production growth today. The steady decline in the rig count implies US natural gas production should peak soon and potentially fall as many companies reduce exposure given the price decrease. Still, natural gas is now back at $3.3/MMBTU (on a spot basis), so it is above the breakeven levels for most companies, implying the rig count may not continue to decline at its recent pace.Without an excessively cold winter or changes in Europe or Asia's situation, there are no solid reasons to expect natural gas prices to rise above the $4-$5 level anytime soon. The historical storage glut in US natural gas inventories has decreased over recent months to around , the commodity ranges from $2.5 to $3.5, given that small surplus level. Natural gas is currently on the higher end of that range, potentially due to expected production declines following the rig count decrease. has spiked slightly over recent months, trading at €37.5/MWH, equivalent to around $12/MMBTU. That figure is above Europe's expected price range but still over 80% below its price range in 2022. Given the spread between US and EU prices, I expect LNG export levels to remain roughly constant, with some increase expected as . As a result of high 2022 prices,  level indicates a glut, though its prices should remain high as it pays extra for non-Russian sources.Overall, the only apparent upside or downside factor for natural gas may be winter weather, as the warm 2022-2023 season significantly contributed to low natural gas prices earlier this year. Today, contract pricing for winter natural gas has a historically low spread due to the  condition outlook. Should the winter weather outlook normalize, natural gas could increase in value. That said, there are no  that will occur soon.Overall, I am very mildly bullish on EQT today. The companies' lower FCF breakeven costs and decent output growth point toward solid income potential over the next year. The natural gas market is a mixed bag, with supplies likely to decrease slightly due to the decline in drilling activity. That said, there are no indications that reserves will rapidly decline swiftly enough to lift natural gas well above its current price range. Further, the warm winter weather outlook has suppressed natural gas prices and could either help or harm going forward as that forecast changes.Ideally, this environment will benefit EQT as stabilized natural gas prices, cost levels, and production levels contribute to steadier profits for the firm. Over most of the past decade, EQT has been highly volatile as immense US natural gas production growth created a very unsteady profit environment. Looking forward, the natural gas market is entering an era of stability as production levels remain relatively steady. EQT's costs remain relatively low, so I expect the firm to generate significant cash flows over the coming year and beyond. In the long run, EQT may benefit from higher natural gas demand and limits to production growth due to the  of US shale.Looking forward, I do not expect EQT's value to rise or fall too dramatically as long as natural gas remains as stable as I expect. That said, the company is an excellent inflation hedge and has, to me, better business economics than most at a much more reasonable valuation. Thus, I believe EQT is a solid long-term value investment with ample upside exposure should natural gas eventually fall back into a shortage.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Tesla: Sell-Off Is Unwarranted,"Since  () reported , the market value of its stock has declined by ~18%. At one point, TSLA shares were down by ~25%, before recovering somewhat over the prior week. We believe the sell-off is unwarranted. TheContrary to Mr. Market's opinion, during 2Q23, relative to 2Q22, TSLA produced 83% more cars, and delivered 86% more. Specifically, ~480,000 cars were produced and ~466,000 were delivered. Sure, margins suffered, driven by discounting on Teslas, that wasEvents that have unfolded over the prior few quarters have demonstrated that TSLA is no longer the scrappy underdog. With its Model Y as the best-selling car in the world and its supercharger turning into the de facto standard in North America, market forces have christened the company as a leader of global automobile. However, TSLA's rapid evolution over the previous decade will appear slow and steady, compared to the fast and furious growth its business is likely to experience, across the next decade of its lifecycle.Undoubtedly, TSLA's story ahead is about the momentum building in its automobile business (surmising that 20 million Teslas are delivered in 2030, an average price of 25,000 and a profit margin/car of 10%, would amount to $50 billion in profits). However, predominant drivers of TSLA's next chapter, are also likely to be its ancillary segments: solar panels/roofing, energy storage, FSD, and Robotaxis. They are likely to match the success of the firm's automobile business head-to-head.In order of magnitude of growth, we view TSLA's energy storage business, as the show stealer, over the next three to five years. TSLA has created an entire ecosystem to facilitate the generation, storage, deployment, and monetization of solar power. For generation of solar energy it provides solar panels/roofing, for storage of the generated power it provides Powerwalls and Megapacks, and for selling surplus energy to the grid, it has Autobidder. Considering that TSLA has simplified activities associated with solar power, its solar panels/roofing, Powerwalls, and Megapacks are experiencing strong customer demand.As Powerwalls are relatively lower priced home power storage systems, majority of sales associated with TSLA's energy storage business will be derived from its Megapacks, which are designed for commercial enterprises, including large utility companies that supply electricity to the grid. Given that solar energy is relatively cheaper to produce than electricity generated deploying fossil fuels, and that it prevents further degradation of the environment, we expect customer demand for Megapacks to expand exponentially. In that regard, it is important to note that Megapacks are backordered until 3Q24.Accordingly, to benefit from the solid customer demand for Megapacks, TSLA has announced plans to rapidly ramp on production. Currently, Megapacks are manufactured for the most part, at TSLA's Lathrop, California facility, which is equipped to produce 10,000 units/year. However, upgrades to the factory are underway, which will double manufacturing capacity, over the next year. In addition, a Megafactory is expected to debut in Shanghai, China during 3Q23, with production of Megapacks anticipated to begin during 2024. Moreover, TSLA has indicated that it plans to launch several Megafactories over the next few years.With each Megapack featuring a storage capacity of just 3MWh, hundreds of units are required to facilitate large scale sustainable energy deployment. Among completed Megapack projects is the 212 unit 350 system in Victoria, Australia, that provides backup energy to the city, a 81 unit 100 MWh system in Angleton, Texas, that provides the grid with outage protection, and a 37 unit 46 MWh system in Soldotna, Alaska, that increases the sustainable energy capacity, and offsets electricity produced at gas turbines.Ongoing projects include a PG&E 367 unit 1.1 GWh (1,100 MWh) system in Moss Landing, California which will supply electricity to the grid, and a 189 unit 565 MWh system in Kapolei, Hawaii, which will support the state's transition to sustainable energy.With respect to earnings potential, each Megapack is priced at ~$2.4 million, and TSLA has indicated that profit margins are consistent with the 10% associated with the company's automobiles. Given the ramp in Megapack production expected over the next few years, it appears that the business is well positioned to deliver solid earnings over the medium term. In regard to demand, it is noteworthy that given the significant benefits associated with sustainable energy, global transition away from fossil fuels is imminent, particularly across the Southern Hemisphere of the globe, where sunshine is abundant and oil imports stress foreign currency reserves.Any discussion on TSLA is incomplete without discussing the firm's FSD platform. FSD is being developed to automate Teslas to a level where they can function without driver intervention. In essence, the plan is to transform Teslas into driverless cars. TSLA's FSD is currently at Level 3 automation (conditional driving automation), which indicates that although Teslas with FSD have the ability to drive from point A to point B, automatically, driver attention is mandatory, at all times, to intervene in case of malfunction.Level 4/5 Automation is required for Teslas to be considered fully automatic, with full ability to function without a driver. TSLA has noted that six billion FSD miles will be required to train the platform to achieve Level 5 automation (full driving automation). At the end of 2Q23, Teslas had traversed 300 million miles on FSD. In addition, 400,000 Teslas in the U.S. and Canada are equipped with FSD. Further, 2.3 million Teslas feature Autopilot, the driver assist system, that is loaded onto every Tesla.Acceleration in the evolution of FSD requires FSD miles and compute power. To support compute power, TSLA has developed the Dojo super computer, which will increase the pace of neural net training associated with FSD. With regard to FSD miles, the greater the magnitude of FSD equipped Teslas on the road, the faster the opportunity to achieve the six billion FSD miles required to achieve full automation. Given the dynamics, TSLA's FSD will achieve Level 5 automation, it is a matter of when not if. However, given the substantial gap between the six billion FSD miles requirement and the 300 million FSD miles currently travelled, it appears that full driving automation for Teslas is ways off.However, Level 4 automation (high driving automation) might be more easily achievable. At Level 4 automation, vehicles can operate in self-driving mode without a driver, usually in urban settings. Once Level 4 automation is achieved, TSLA might be positioned to embark on its Robotaxi business. Alphabet's () Waymo Robotaxis operate on Level 4 automation. In addition, at Level 4 automation, FSD at $15,000, might become more attractive to potential Tesla purchasers.Management has indicated that its Robotaxis will be fleets of driverless vehicles without pedals and steering wheels, built specifically for ride sharing, and private FSD equipped Teslas that owners can potentially ply out through a dedicated Robotaxi application. Given that the cost/mile associated with the Robotaxis is anticipated to be approximately $0.18 compared to the current $2 to $3 linked to car services, the potential for profits is significant. TSLA has stated that it anticipates splitting profits 50/50 with private Tesla owners that join the Tesla Robotaxi network.To ballpark potential revenues associated with the service, it is noteworthy that General Motors' () affiliated Cruise, that provides Robotaxi service on the West Coast, has projected that revenues linked to its business are likely to touch $50 billion by 2030. Considering that automation associated with Cruise EVs is based on mapping of entire cities, while Level 4 automation Teslas could be plied anywhere without limitation, the potential for revenue generation related to Tesla Robotaxis is exponentially higher.However, FSD has to achieve Level 4 automation before TSLA's Robotaxi business can even be launched. Unless the company changes track and launches a Robotaxi service based on mapping entire cities. Considering, that we view such a scenario as highly unlikely, a potential launch estimate for TSLA's Robotaxis is yet to be determined.Net-net, investors should not be valuing TSLA on the basis of one month of declining deliveries of Teslas in China. They should be focusing on the sum-of-the-parts associated with the firm's multiple segments. Given business conditions, we believe TSLA's stock at current levels represents a Buying opportunity. Therefore, we are reiterating our Price Target of $492/share and Buy Rating. Please note that our Price Target excludes earnings from solar panels/roofing, energy storage, FSD, and Robotaxis, pending additional color from TSLA.Armed with government support from all over the world, the industry's largest and growing production capacity, the ability to deploy price cuts to keep inventory moving, and competition that appears slow on the uptake, all is well at TSLA automobiles. As the pioneer of the industry, the company's cars are as synonymous with EVs as Xerox was to photocopying and Cadbury's was to chocolate. Now TSLA appears well positioned to work its magic on additional verticals associated with sustainable energy - solar panels/roofing and battery storage systems, and potentially FSD and Robotaxis. Earnings will keep rolling in, for sure. Blue skies for Tesla, Inc. Blue skies for TSLA investors.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

() Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript October 25, 2023 10:00 AM ETJune Filingeri - Comm-Partners LLCDennis Oates - Chairman, President and Chief Executive OfficerChristopher M. Zimmer - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerSteven DiTommaso - Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerPhilip Gibbs - KeyBancRobert Sales - LMK Capital ManagementThank you for standing by, and welcome to the Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call and Webcast. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, June Filingeri. Please go ahead.Thank you. Good morning. This is June Filingeri of Comm-Partners. And I also would like to welcome you to the Universal's call and webcast. We are here to discuss the company's third quarter 2023 results reported this morning.With us from management are Denny Oates, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Zimmer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; John Arminas, Vice President and General Counsel; and Steve DiTommaso, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before I turn the call over to management, let me quickly review procedures. After management has made formal remarks, we will take your questions. Jonathan, our operator, will instruct you on procedures at that time. Also, please note that in this morning's call, management will make forward-looking statements. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, I would like to remind you of the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in today's press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.With the formalities complete, I would now like to turn the call over to Denny Oates. Denny, we are ready to begin.Thanks, June. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our third quarter performance essentially met our short-term expectations, both top line and bottom line. Let me hit some of theOur gross margin expanded to 15.2% of sales, the highest since the second quarter of 2018, despite commodity headwinds. Operating income increased by 43% from the second quarter. As a result, our net income doubled sequentially to $1.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $9.5 million, up 20% from Q2 and was 1.5 times greater than the third quarter last year.Inventories were reduced $800,000 and managed working capital remained at 53% of sales despite the sales growth and high backlog. Capital spending was $3 million with major projects on time and within budget. Lastly, we reduced debt by another $3.8 million to $89.5 million, while liquidity improved to $31 million on September 30 compared to $24 million on June 30.There were five main drivers of our third quarter performance. First, a richer product mix, mainly more premium alloy sales and aggressive mix management of our air-melted portfolio. Second, higher base selling prices. We've implemented 15 base selling prices since late 2021. The P&L benefit of these increases will continue to grow as we move through the next several quarters. Third, increased production levels with well-controlled fixed overhead spending. Production is running about 15% ahead of last year as we strive to ramp up operations. Fourth, my compliments to the manufacturing team on setting several monthly production records, especially in our Vacuum-Arc remelting operation in North Jackson and the intermediate bar cell at our Dunkirk facility, which you'll recall, we installed just before COVID. Our Dunkirk plant also set a new monthly finished bar shipping record in September. Fifth, our focused efforts to improve yields in recent years are also beginning to pay dividends, particularly in our [indiscernible] plate products and growing finished round bar products.Turning to the order book. Order entry was up sequentially on strong aerospace demand and order backlog remained substantial at $345 million before surcharges. Premium products represented 37% of our backlog. Our strong backlog and demonstrated positive trends in operations gives us confidence in continued sequential improvements in performance.One additional very important update. I'm also pleased to announce that our Board, as a part of its leadership succession plan, unanimously named Chris Zimmer as our new President and Chief Executive Officer effective November 1. Chris is a 15-year Universal veteran. He joined Universal as Vice President of Sales and Marketing and currently serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. He knows our company inside and out, and he's well established as a leader in specialty metals industry.As I stated in our release this morning, I have confidence that Chris' leadership, working in concert with the senior management team, sets the stage for Universal to have a very exciting future. On a personal note, I will be transitioning to Executive Chairman of the company, focusing on a smooth leadership transition, longer-term strategic issues and my normal Chairman responsibilities. So Chris, congratulations. I look forward to supporting you and the team as you assume your new responsibilities. I'll turn it over to you for your review of operations.Thank you, Denny. I appreciate your kind words, and I'm grateful for your ongoing support. I'm deeply honored to take on this leadership role and for the board's confidence in me. This is an exciting time, and I'm looking forward to continuing the work with our talented management team to execute our long-term strategy and profitably grow our business.And now turning to my operating report. Let me start with our capital project at the North Jackson plant where we're adding two VAR furnaces. We're now in the final commissioning and technical validation phase with full integration into operations to begin in the first quarter of 2024. Once complete, the project will increase our bar capacity by 20%. Bar capacity was a pinch point for us back in 2018 and 2019. The new VAR furnaces have better technology and better controls that will mainly be used for premium alloy production.Premium alloys are the critical platform for our growth strategy. As Denny highlighted, our third quarter premium alloy sales increased 28% from the second quarter. They were double the level of third quarter of 2022 and they were up 83% year-to-date. Production levels at our remelt shops, hot working mills and major finishing units, all continued to improve sequentially. As we already announced on September 1, we reached a new fiveyear agreement with the hourly employees at our Bridgeville plant. Company-wide, our employment stability continues to improve as our labor headcount has increased 5% since the end of the second quarter.Turning to Commodities. Nickel ratcheted down another 4% in the third quarter closing at $8.90, the lowest level in two years. While the strong aerospace market and electric vehicle industry are a source of growing demand for nickel, supply is outpacing demand due to Indonesian production, which is up 50% in just three years. Continued weakness in the Chinese economy is adding additional pressure. In fact, nearly every metal tracked declined sequentially in the quarter including scrap, which fell by 11%. It's worth noting that the prime scrap market in the Pittsburgh region stabilized in October and is expected to gain traction during the rest of the year. As anticipated, we saw a negative surcharge misalignment in Q3 and we expect misalignment in the fourth quarter to moderate.Let's turn to end markets, beginning with aerospace, our largest market. Aerospace sales increased 5% in the third quarter of 2023 to a new record of $54 million or 76% of sales. They were up 71% from the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date sales reached $154.2 million, a 58% increase in the same period of 2022. Demand for our aerospace products remains robust in the third quarter, and that level of demand continues to grow. The demand drivers remain the same. Air traffic continues to recover and is on the verge of a full recovery back to pre-pandemic levels. Airlines continue to place substantial orders for new, more fuel-efficient, planes as they upgrade and expand their fleets to meet customer demand. As a result, order books at Boeing and Airbus extend past the end of the decade, and both are continuing to press hard to increase production levels.Looking at recent developments at the airplane manufacturers, Boeing delivered 105 airplanes in the third quarter, including 69 of the 737 MAX and 19 787 Dreamliners. Deliveries in September were lower than expected because they needed to fix and inspect thousands of holes in the 737 MAX bulkhead that were drilled improperly. Last week, Spirit entered into an agreement with Boeing to achieve production stability at its facilities and support higher deliveries. Boeing has provided funding for tooling and capital through 2025 for planned and potential 737 and 787 rate increases.Boeing's third quarter activity was strong, totaling 321 commercial planes with 200 737 MAXs and 120 787s. By the end of the quarter, Boeing's commercial backlog had increased 4% to 5,172 planes. September was the first month since December of 2019 that their backlog surpassed 5,000. Boeing has reportedly laid out an aggressive build rate plan for the 737 and a master schedule for its suppliers that it reaffirmed in their earnings release today. The plan calls for a production rate of 38 per month by the end of the year, with plans to increase to 50 in the 2025 to 2026 time frame. The 787 program is now transitioning production to 5 per month and plans to increase to 10 per month in that 2025 to 2026 time frame.Meanwhile, Airbus delivered 172 aircraft in the third quarter and won total orders of 200 new planes. Airbus plans to deliver 720 planes this year and its current production rate is estimated for 48 per month. In the company's second quarter report, Airbus said that their production of the A320 family was progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 per month in 2026. On wide-bodies, Airbus continues to target a rate of three A330s per month in 2024 moving to 9 A350s per month by the end of 2025.Looking at the data supporting the demand for new aircraft, IATA reported total traffic in August of 2023 rose 28% from August of last year. Global traffic is now at 96% of pre-COVID levels. That included a 30% increase in international traffic versus the same period a month ago -- the same month a year ago, with all markets demonstrating double-digit gains year-over-year. Domestic travel has reached 109% of August 2019 levels. It's also reflected in the TSA daily passenger screening count, which exceeded 2.7 million on October 22 versus 2.5 million on that date in 2022 and 2.5 million back in 2019.Looking at the airlines, all three of the major U.S. carriers reported record third quarter revenues. Delta Airlines saw 6% higher domestic travel and 35% higher international travel and said strong demand is continuing into the fourth quarter. United Airlines also reported higher domestic and international traffic year-on-year. American Airlines attributed their growth to a resilient demand environment. All three airlines referenced the spike in fuel costs, which reinforces the case for newer, more fuel-efficient airplanes.The defense industry has been in sharp focus given the war in Ukraine and the tragic attack by Hamas in Israel. Needless to say, market demand remained strong. Lockheed Martin reported better-than-expected third quarter results, along with a record backlog for both domestic and international customers. An area of focus is their next-generation F-35 jets, which they expect to begin delivering in the spring. Additionally, the State Department has greenlighted a $5 billion sale of 25 F-35 jets to South Korea, subject to congressional approval.For Universal Stainless, the opportunities in commercial aerospace and defense are both substantial and continuing to increase as we execute our initiatives to expand our portfolio of products and approvals. With our increased premium alloy portfolio, we are growing our presence in the engine side of the airplane and winning new business. More approvals from the primes have led to stronger order entry. Overall, the supply chain remains in a pull mode, and strong demand is expected to continue well into 2024 and beyond.The heavy equipment market remained our second largest market in the third quarter of 2023 with sales of $8.9 million or 13% of sales, which is level with the second quarter and 44% higher than the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date sales of $24.8 million rose 15% from the prior year period. Metal fabrication demand drives our heavy equipment market sales mainly for automotive applications, especially model changeovers. We said last time that we expected our sales to that market to remain solid in the third quarter, and that was the case.However, we've also noted tool steel plate demand can be lumpy. While the automakers report strong third quarter sales with an estimated 3.9 million cars and trucks sold in the period, the prolonged UAW strike actions against GM, Ford and Stellantis have been disruptive to their operations. As a result, our customers are showing signs of caution, and we expect some softening in our heavy equipment sales in the fourth quarter. Once the strikes are resolved, we expect quarterly sequential growth throughout 2024 to return as they have in normal years.The general industrial market remained our third largest market in the third quarter of 2023 with sales of $3.3 million or 5% of sales, which is up 3% from the second quarter of 2023 and up 50% from the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date sales rose 35% to $10.1 million. Our general industrial sales are mainly for semiconductor manufacturing. In their latest report, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported that semiconductor sales improved for the sixth consecutive month in August, providing optimism for continued momentum in the months to come. We said last time that we were bullish about 2024 with the ramp up beginning in the second half of this year, and that forecast remains on track.Sales to the oil and gas market totaled $2.6 million or 4% of sales in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 15% from the second quarter and 30% lower in the second quarter -- the third quarter in 2022. Year-to-date sales of $10.4 million were 18% lower than the same period of '22. As was the case in the second quarter, the decline in our third quarter oil and gas sales reflects our decision to temporarily shift more of our production to higher-margin aerospace products. Last quarter, Baker Hughes, Halliburton and SLB, formerly Schlumberger, all said that they expected softness in the U.S. land market to continue in the second half of 2023. That was borne out in Baker Hughes' third quarter rig count data with U.S. oil rig count falling 9%, while the gas rig count was down 15%.Let me emphasize that our shift away from oil and gas is temporary. We intend to fully resume servicing our customers in that market as our production levels continue to increase. Power generation market sales totaled $700,000 or 1% of sales in the third quarter of 2023, down 46% from the second quarter and 54% lower than the third quarter last year. Year-to-date sales of $3.1 million were down 38%. As is the case in oil and gas, we have temporarily shifted finishing capacity away from the power gen market to aerospace applications. We primarily serve the gas turbine maintenance market and intend to do so going forward.Now let me turn the call over to Steve for his report on our financials.Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter sales reached $71.3 million, the highest level in the past 10 years, driven by growth in our premium products and our aerospace end market and by increasing base prices. Our premium product sales totaled $16.5 million, which is our second highest ever, second only to the first quarter of this year, and our aerospace sales of $54 million reached a record level.Year-to-date, our premium product sales through nine months totaled $47 million, which is more than any previous full calendar year and compares to $25.7 million in the first nine months of last year. That increase is driven by a more than 50% increase in the volume of our premium shipments, plus a more than 20% increase in the average price per pound of these products.Third quarter gross margin of 15.2% was almost a full point better than the 14.3% achieved in Q2 despite misalignment of $1.8 million between our sales price surcharge and our materials costs, holding back margin by an additional 200-plus basis points. Consistent with our plan, margin has expanded each quarter this year as a result of higher base prices, more shipment volume, a richer shipment mix and higher production.Selling, general and administrative costs totaled $6.4 million in Q3, down from $6.8 million in Q2 and approximately in line with the first quarter of this year. Year-over-year, SG&A expenses increased due to higher property insurance costs and higher employee-related costs, but is 9.5% of our sales for the current year-to-date compared with about 10.5% last year.Operating income of $4.4 million is also a sequential increase and at its highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Interest expense increased in Q3 and totaled $2.1 million compared with an even $2 million in both the first and second quarters this year. The increase is due to persistently high interest rates, partly offset by lower average borrowing levels in Q3 versus Q2. Our pretax income of $2.2 million resulted in net income of $1.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share outstanding, and our effective tax rate for the quarter of 13.4% continues to primarily reflect a federal statutory rate of 21% adjusted for the impact of research and development tax credits earned. State income taxes and discrete items impacting the quarter are not significant.EBITDA was $9.2 million, a $1.6 million increase compared to last quarter, while adjusted EBITDA was $9.5 million, the highest since the third quarter of 2018. The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA for each period presented is provided in the tables with the press release.During the third quarter, we generated $6.7 million of cash from our operations, while growing receivables on high September sales and decreasing our inventory, despite the sales increase and our robust backlog. In total, we have generated $17.8 million in cash from operations in the current year-to-date. We used $9.7 million of that cash on capital expenditures and the rest to pay down our debt. Second quarter capital expenditures were $2.7 million.We expect full year CapEx to come in between $14 million and $16 million, with about half of that total going to our investment in remelt capacity at our North Jackson facility where we are commissioning the two new Vacuum-Arc Remelt furnaces.Regarding our financial position as of September 30. Total debt was $89.5 million down $3.7 million this quarter and nearly $9 million compared with the end of last year. Revolver availability increased to about $31 million compared to $24 million last quarter. Managed working capital increased by $3.2 million sequentially despite a $5.7 million increase in accounts receivable.Managed working capital decreased as a percent of annualized sales to 53%. Our days sales outstanding ratio this quarter increased to 47.7 days compared to 41.3 in Q2, but our underlying collection cycle in both periods was similar. Sales were back-end loaded in Q3 and we continue to target a collection cycle in the low 40s. And inventory at the end of the quarter was modestly down versus Q2.In summary, we have delivered two consecutive quarters of positive earnings while paying down debt and expanding our liquidity, our backlog remains strong, and we continue to increase production levels. We expect to continue this momentum in the fourth quarter and into 2024.That concludes my financial report. And I'll hand the call back to Denny.Thanks, Steve. So we were pleased with the third quarter results, but we are very far from being satisfied. We're looking at the fourth quarter and on into 2024 with growing optimism. That optimism is based on a number of things. Our near-record backlog of $345 million, which contains 37% high-margin premium products. Our evolving product mix changed towards more premium melted and finished bar products, both higher-margin product lines. Our growing capture of base price increases embedded in our backlog will add to margin expansion directly with each passing month.Commodities appear to be stabilizing, as Chris said, which will reduce the negative misalignment experienced over the past couple of quarters. Plant activity levels are increasing and plan to continue to increase providing the opportunity for better fixed cost coverage and variable cost reduction. Process improvements are generating benefits in terms of productivity per equipment hour and in higher product yields. Our capital project that had much needed Vacuum-Arc Remelt capacity is wrapping up and will be ready for service early next year. We are seeing slow, steady improvement on the labor, supply chain and inflation fronts.Most importantly, I'm confident that the leadership of Chris and his senior management team, along with the talent and commitment of the roughly 700 Universal employees, is a powerful formula for future success and I look forward to working with them in my new role.Lastly, I want to thank our Board, stockholders and all of our employees for your support, advice and counsel during my almost 16-year tenure as Universal's President and CEO. And it has truly been an honor and a pleasure.With that, we'll conclude our formal remarks. Jonathan, we're ready to take some questions.Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc.Hey, good morning.Good morning, Phil. How are you doing.Good. Congrats Chris.Thank you, Phil. I appreciate it. Thank you.Sure. Then on the gross margin piece, I think you teased out $1.8 million of misalignment. And I know at least on the -- for the flat roll guys, some of the nickel and stainless surcharges have declined for the November month. So still heading down. Is that factored into your forecast that you still would expect easing this misalignment?Yes. The rate is actually slowing, so we do expect to see it in the fourth quarter, but likely not to the degree that we did in the third quarter.And then on the CapEx side, is the roughly $15 million spend outlook still intact for the year? And should we assume that within that number, about half of that is related to maintenance? And also as we look out into 2024, seemingly the CapEx is going to stay around the same levels, given the investments that you have on the docket?Yes, Phil, that's correct. So the number for the current year will come in right around $15 million. It could be a little more, it could be a little bit less, depending on the timing of wrapping up some projects here. About half of that 2023 number is related to the growth CapEx installing and commissioning the new VARs in North Jackson. So the rest of it is maintenance type or smaller strategic type CapEx projects and aren't quite as individually large as that remelt expansion.And then the second part of your question for 2024, yes, we expect similar CapEx levels in 2024. About half going to projects for growth or expansion and about half maintaining that historical maintenance level.And then on the labor side, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you said things are easing in terms of some of the constraints out there that you see. Where are you all in terms of your specific situation? And are you expecting to increase your headcount further or are you in spot at this point?Yes, Phil, it's getting better. We're not quite exactly where we want to get to. Stability is improving. We're shifting more of those onboarding customers into core workers that give us the type of safe working conditions and productivity that we expect going forward. I suspect we'll probably add a few more heads. We're not quite done staffing up the plants the way that we want to have them staffed, but when I think back to where we were a year ago versus where we are today, it's absolutely a better environment. And every quarter that goes by, we continue to get more stability.So I think we're really close to getting to that level we want to get to. And as these new customers that have come on board continue to mature in their roles, productivity is going to continue to improve as we stabilize headcount.Thank you. And then just lastly, you've done a good job maintaining a nice base level of inventory as you've grown your volumes over the last couple of quarters. What's the outlook that you have for net working capital over the balance of the year and maybe into early next year and inventory specifically? Thanks.So net working capital may grow modestly in the future, mainly on higher receivables related to our higher sales outlook. Inventory, the mix is going to shift a little bit to more premium product, which has some upward pressure on the inventory dollars, but we are trying to continue to manage our terms improvement. So we improved terms in 2023. We're continuing to focus on that. And we will be looking to keep that inventory dollars line as flat as possible as we step through 2024. So that's the goal. So implicit in there will be a modest increase in managed working capital, but certainly continued improvement as a percent of our sales line.To sneak one more in for Chris specifically. Chris, I know you worked a lot on the commercial side and product development along with the rest of the team. As it relates to your comments regarding winning new business with jet engine manufacturers, I would think that, that's part of the reason why you're investing in North Jackson a little bit more heavily. Maybe kind of talk about that evolution and how you've gotten here, and then what gives you confidence that you can continue to build that moving forward? Thank you.Yes. One of the benefits of this environment that's been extremely strong as demand has snapped back coming out of COVID, is the focus that the primes that we've been working with to point their engineering resources towards approvals has been as good as it's been since we purchased North Jackson back in 2011. So we developed a lot of these products early on, but it's really only been in the past 18 to 24 months where a lot of the prime approvals have started to come in.That's opened up the door for us to start booking new business for these alloys and it's 1 of the primary drivers of our backlog, and it's starting to show up now in our shipments. So that's really been the game changer has been the prime's willingness and their focus to mitigate risk in their supply chain, bring us on as a new supplier, and this is for a number of different primes and applications. So that's the part we're really excited about, really being able to fulfill the potential of North Jackson, and I think we're going to realize that in '24 and moving forward.The capital that's going into North Jackson when we talk about the VARs and a couple of other smaller projects really round out some of the pinch points. They pave the way for us to continue to grow. So the majority of those assets are already in place. We still got capacity to grow on a number of them. So the capital is really focused towards our ability to smoothly execute that growth and continue to serve customers. So that's the primary thing that I would say is what's changed and what's really got us excited about rounding out this year and heading into next year as we've got this big backlog to work against.Any way to size up the revenue potential of the premium alloy business or North Jackson as you look out a couple of years? And then how much of that would be dedicated, generally speaking, to the engine guys? That's my last one.Yes. I think when we look back historically, we talked about what that investment in North Jackson can mean. We've talked about incremental sales of $100 million has been the historical number that we've talked about at very rich premiums from a margin standpoint. The markets continue to evolve. I would say that, that number is probably closer to $120 million to $130 million at this point. And that expectation for solid margins remains intact.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bob Sales from LMK Capital Management. Your question please.Hi. Thanks. Just one question on the premium alloy products. With 28% of the revenue in Q3 being premium and the backlog containing 37%, do you have any sort of quantitative guidance for us in terms of what you're planning towards with premium alloys as a percentage of revenue or total dollars in Q4?Yes. We expect that to range between 25% to 30%. Right now with lead times, the backlog appears to be higher because we do have a number of products that we continue to book with shorter lead times. So even though the backlog contains 37%, that shows the richness that's there and the promise that it is coming, but there's a number of products that we'll continue to book into 2024 that should bring us back down around that 25% to 30% range going forward.Got it. Got it. Okay. And then on the misalignment of commodity prices with -- did you say it was $1.8 million in the quarter?Yes, that's correct.Do you -- again, can you be -- if commodity prices stayed where they are now, can you offer any precision as to how much better they might look in Q4?There are a few moving parts in there, but a rough cut would be about half of what we experienced in Q3 would recur in Q4 from continual decline in our surcharges.Fantastic. And do you expect to be able to make any more progress against inventory to bring it down given the, I guess, sort of inventory headwind of having more premium alloy in the mix?So -- yes. So we are focused on continuing to improve our volumetric terms because we will have a higher mix of premium alloys with inventory in the coming quarters. That comes with a higher dollar amount. So it will provide a little bit of a headwind there that you acknowledge. But as we look out into 2024, we want to manage against that and keep inventory as flat as possible. So we're not planning on that driving a big increase in the inventory dollar line item.Yes. Got it. Got it. And then last question is, you talked about the product approvals starting to flow into the order book given that you've been working on them for a while. Are those approvals skewed towards commercial or defense, one way or the other?There's a healthy mix. I think the majority of it as that we're able to identify go towards commercial applications. But as we sell into the engine manufacturers, for example, a number of the alloys that we're qualified on now and supplying into, can go into applications that will show up on a commercial airplane and they go into defense applications, both on fighter jets and rotorcraft. Rough cut, when we look at where we believe our metal is going to, and again, the visibility can be challenging because 75% of our sales flow through service centers and forgers. But we believe that close to three quarters of our volume is going towards commercial applications and the balance going towards military applications.Got. Okay. Great performance. Congratulations.Thank you.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Oates for any further remarks.Thanks, Jonathan. Once again, thank you for joining us this morning. We continue to execute on our strategy in the third quarter. We remain optimistic about the fourth quarter and 2024. We look forward to updating you on that progress on our next call in January. In the meantime, please enjoy your holidays, be well and stay safe. Have a good day.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Energy Transfer: The Cash Flow Beast Everyone Should Own," () is a $41-billion market cap firm that  across 41 US states and plays a vital role in transporting 30% of US natural gas, 35% of US crude oil, and 20% ofThe company is divided into 5 segments and has investments in subsidiaries involved in various energy-related activities. These include compression services, natural gas marketing, and resource management. They also hold interests in other companies engaged in compression services and manage coal and natural resource properties, generating revenue from royalties and land management activities. NGL fractionation, transportation, and midstream gathered volumes hit record highs of 5%, 13%, and 8% growth, respectively. Intrastate natural gas transportation rose by 3%, while interstate gas transportation saw a substantial 17% increase. Crude transportation and terminal volumes surged by 23% and 15%, respectively.The increase in volumes helped slightly offset the sharp fall YoY in the price of transported commodities in all the company's main segments. But of course, this was not enough to achieve similar financial results to the previous year.Despite total revenues falling by 29.3% YoY in Q2, ET's adjusted EBITDA amounted to $3.12 billion compared to $3.23 billion in Q2 2022, which is not that bad. Distributable cash flow [DCF] was $1.55 billion, compared to $1.88 billion in Q2 2022, with excess cash flow after distributions at $579 million.As of June 30, 2023, their credit facility had $2.36 billion available.  ~$387 million in growth CAPEX for Q2 FY2023. ET acquired Lotus Midstream Operations and continues to integrate operations. Lake Charles LNG secured non-binding agreements for long-term LNG offtake totaling 3.6 million tonnes per annum.The company's liquidity is at a very good level, and the constant attempts to expand the volume base speak, in my opinion, to the quality of the management of the excess cash flow. Management is clearly looking to the years ahead and is not limited to the current conditions of the still ongoing bull oil & gas cycle.Long-term debt on the balance sheet decreased by 7.4% compared to the previous year, as part of the debt was transferred to short-term debt, which matures in 2024. The company's cash flow capacity seems sufficient, in my opinion, to service the debt easily; the debt burden itself is not high in relation to equity.ET projected adjusted EBITDA for FY2023 to range between $13.1 billion and $13.4 billion. That's around 15.4% to the consensus revenue figure  from ET for FY2023:A quarterly cash distribution of $0.31 per common unit ($1.24 annualized) was announced for Q2 2023. This puts the forward yield at ~9.5%, which is well above average even among energy stocks. Many readers are probably wondering if this yield is sustainable, as the O&G sector is very cyclical and unstable to all sorts of macro issues. Historically, ET's payout grew at a CAGR of  [10-year period] over the long term. Today,  that ET's dividend yield will increase to 10.21% by FY2025:Like many analysts at Seeking Alpha, I  for the development of the global economy in the foreseeable future - this should certainly put pressure on demand for hydrocarbons of all types. However, in the case of ET, this seems to be partially priced in, as the yield is so high even though from a historical perspective we are now roughly in the zone of normality:Because the falls of 2015 and 2020 in the chart above had very different reasons than the ones that are likely to happen next in my view.This time, the major oil exporters appear to be aware of the medium-term risks and are positioning their production levels accordingly. This has led to one of the most oil price-supportive setups in crude oil inventories today:At the same time, demand for certain activities has not yet recovered from COVID, such as the demand for jet fuel in China:If we look at the positioning of hedge funds, the energy sector does not seem to be that crowded so far, despite its superior rise last month:In my opinion, the energy sector has not yet lost its attractiveness for investors, as buying volumes have just started to return to the market, according to data from Ned Davis [proprietary source]. The valuation of the sector as a whole is also still enticing. The energy sector accounts for 12.4% of the S&P 500's gains, third only to technology and financials. However, it accounts for only 4.3% of the index's market capitalization, placing it 8th.ET itself should get an additional tailwind from the growing buying power in the sector, as the company looks like a very reliable midstream player with a good balance sheet, healthy growth ambitions, and now a very attractive dividend yield, which sell-side analysts believe is set to rise further.Again, I suggest looking at a company's valuation in a historical context, based on both TTM and FWD metrics. I usually look at EV/EBITDA [in the case of oil and gas - EBITDAR]. Since YCharts does not provide data on EBITDAR values, I will focus on the classic calculation formula for simplicity of visualization.So let's take a look back at 2020. Crude oil futures fell into negative territory for the first time in their history, forcing some derivatives textbooks authors to urgently add to their new editions. Energy companies faced unprecedented downtime - no one needed oil. The global economy was at a standstill, and the prevailing uncertainty led to a general panic in the stock market. As we can see in the chart below, at the height of this panic, the EV/EBITDA of ET dropped to about 7x, possibly even a bit lower. After that, the drop in actual EBITDA values from ET led to a sharp increase in this metric, which is logical.Since 2021, oil and gas companies, including ET, have been on the upswing, leading to a further decline in their EV/EBITDA ratios. As I wrote above, this sector is very cyclical, so it is not surprising that EV/EBITDA multiples fall sharply at some point: most likely they will rise sharply again when selling volumes/prices fall. if ET's volumes are growing at the moment [we saw it in Q2] and the market is waiting for a probable increase in energy prices in the foreseeable future due to the building supply/ demand imbalance, why is the FWD metric even lower than the TTM metric, when the logic of things should be the other way around? If you have an answer to my question, please let me know in the comments below.I assume that even if the multiples of ET remain where they are now, income-seeking investors in the form of large funds (and not only them) should come to buy this stock because of its growth approach and shareholder return policy. The distribution yield looks quite stable even against the backdrop of the sharp decline in the share price in recent months.Even in the event of a mild recession, ET should feel relatively comfortable thanks to its margin of safety. How much further should its EV/EBITDA ratio fall?And what is the growth upside of ET's FCF yield in this case?I simply don't have answers to my last 2 questions.My current Buy rating has a number of pitfalls. First, it is not at all necessary that hydrocarbon prices continue to rise, as we have seen in recent weeks. I believe that we still have a mild recession ahead of us due to declining purchasing power and rising real interest rates. Oil prices are very elastic to changes in market demand. So if the US manufacturing activity feels more pain than I expect, the increase in volume from ET may not be enough to keep it undervalued.Be that as it may, it seems to me that ET is now an excellent long-term choice for income-seeking investors today, while not all funds have yet managed to put their capital into this cash flow beast.If the influx of new investors I expect occurs, the current valuation of ET will allow it to rise to 10 times EV/EBITDA, based on historical trends. At a current enterprise value of $104 billion, ET will become ~15% undervalued in this case. Amid its high dividend yield of over 9%, ET looks even more attractive.Therefore, ET stock is an undervalued ""Buy"", in my view.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to !

Lithium Americas: Game Time,"In an ironic twist typical of the stock market,  () recently started lithium production and the stock now trades at multi-year lows. The stock market has a long history of valuing a concept at higher valuation multiplesWith the Cauchari-Olaroz mine in Argentina producing the  back in June, investors should be able to relax on the risk of whether Lithium Americas can effectively construct a mine. The whole investment thesis surrounds whether the management team can construct and operate lithium mines in Argentina and the U.S.The major risk to the investment thesis is mostly de-risked now with theLithium Americas now projects 5,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate production this year. The new mine has total capacity of 40,000 ktpa by mid-2024 with the ability to further expand the mine another 20,000 tonnes via Phase 2.Thacker Pass has the same production capability in Phase 1 at 40 ktpa LCE with the ability to double capacity another 40 ktpa LCE. In essence, Lithium Americans can quickly go from 5 ktpa LCE in 2023 to a couple of mines topping 140 ktpa LCE by the end of the decade.The issue going forward is much more about timing and financing then meeting production goals. Due to the expected lithium supply gap issues in the years ahead, any company like Lithium Americas with current lithium supply will benefit from project delays.In essence, if Lithium Americas fails to hit production targets with new mines, lithium will just enter further under supply scenarios and the price of lithium will rise. The company is in a win-win situation with production in hand now.The revenue picture starts opening up with the start of lithium production. Lithium Americas obtains 49% of Caucharí-Olaroz Phase 1 mine output suggesting 2,450 tonnes in the 2H of the year.The consensus analyst (only 2) estimates have the lithium miner reaching $117 million this year. The current lithium prices of ~$30K won't support those revenue levels, but the ultimate key is the 2024 production levels and future plans for Thacker Pass to open in 2026.The Argentina mine alone with production of ~19,600 tpa for Lithium Americas (future Lithium Argentina). At this current price, the company will generate 2025 revenues closer to $600 million compared to the $700 million targets for analysts, though the price of lithium could easily rebound from the current lows.The company is highly profitable with lithium prices at only $24K. In fact, the Thacker Pass project will deliver $1.15 billion in adjusted EBITDA from at the start of Phase 2 production in year 5.The stock has fallen to a market cap of only $2.8 billion despite the very positive economics of lithium due to strong demand from EVs and renewable energy projects. Lithium Americas has a cash balance of $500 million with limited costs remaining to finish the capex on the Argentina mine.The company is working with the U.S. DOE on the ATVM Loan Program to fund 75% of the costs of the Thacker Pass Phase 1 project. The split up of the business into two companies will alter some of the investment thesis on whether one wants to own the Argentina company turning to positive cash flows here or the Americas division taking on a loan for a huge project in Nevada.The key investor takeaway is that Lithium Americas is very appealing on dips. The stock starts trading at only 2x to 3x adjusted EBITDA targets for the Thacker Pass mine alone, assuming even lower lithium prices in the future despite supply concerns.Investors should use weakness to load up on a lithium miner starting production with the stock trading at the lows.Stone Fox Capital (aka Mark Holder) is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

Albemarle: Bottoming And Heading Higher From Here,"The share price for Albemarle Corporation () has been steady downwards in the last 12 months. However, this has not stopped the company from expanding and reaching new markets. Quite recently the company announced a non-binding However, the market doesn't seem to be rewarding ALB with the price premium I think it could have. A FWD p/e of under 7 is a significant discount to the 24 it has averaged over the last 5 years. I think the downside is limited from here, even though the chart might look like it's a falling knife scenario. I think however that the demand for lithium will eventually push the prices upwards and even though ALB isALB is a global company  in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of engineered specialty chemicals. The company operates through three primary segments: Lithium, Bromine, and Catalysts. Historically, ALB has been primarily known as a specialty chemicals company. However, in recent years, it has strategically shifted its focus towards becoming a prominent lithium producer, making lithium production its top priority.The most important and prominent segment though I think investors are watching is the Lithium segment, ALB offers a range of lithium compounds, including lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and lithium chloride. This strategic transition reflects the growing demand for lithium in various industries, particularly the EV sector, where lithium-ion batteries are a critical component.Over the long term, ALB continues to see lithium sales growing at a rapid rate. Until 2027 it's expected to see CAGR sales growth of 20 - 30%. The demand is fueled by the growing EV industry and the need to establish more clean energy sources. The material used there is lithium for example.Lithium has garnered substantial  from investors in recent years, primarily driven by its pivotal role in the EV industry. As an essential component in EV manufacturing, the demand for lithium has outpaced its availability, leading to significant price surges in 2021 and 2022. This surge in demand has been primarily fueled by the rapid expansion of the EV market, with both 2021 and 2022 witnessing a remarkable uptick in the adoption of electric cars.The demand for lithium has been very visible and ALB is aiming to further capitalize on this as they aim to triple the lithium conversion by 2030. Given that some are estimating there to be a  of lithium in the coming decades, this switch and acceleration from ALB I think will result in strong earnings growth and shareholder value. What we need to look out for though is favorable prices. If the market for some reason turns softer and prices drop, the incentive to increase production like this quite quickly falls.Further strengthening the fact that lithium will see demand is that prices need to be above $20/kg to fund over 100 new projects to ease demand. If the prices remain lower projects won't begin and that will eventually create an even bigger gap between demand and actual production levels. Eventually, we might see a catalyst for the prices, a little like we saw in 2022 when prices shot up to almost $ 60,000 per tonne.In quite recent news, Rinehart  a significant stake in Liontown, but I don't think this is going to deter the case that ALB can finalize the deal. There still seems to be a strong conviction that ALB is suitable to acquire Liontown. I think this is short-term noise that doesn't really affect the deal too much, in my opinion.The announcement of  lithium nationalization has significantly impacted ALB stock performance, pushing it to its lowest point starting in April. The Chilean government's initiative to establish a national company with the potential to assume control of all existing lithium mines once current leases expire has introduced a considerable element of risk. This move has raised concerns in the market and triggered speculation that the government may seek to increase royalties on lithium mining operations.Volatile commodity prices are of course a risk for ALB as it makes the future earnings quite unpredictable. This quite often results in a lower multiple for a company, but I think that what ALB is receiving is too low. Where I can see investors being worried is the inconsistent cash flows over the years. This is making it difficult to see how the dividend may be growing. In my view though, rising lithium prices will improve the cash flows and also the likelihood that the dividend gets a raise in the medium term. It has grown for 28 years straight and I think ALB is in a position still where they can maintain this tradition. With more contracts for ALB, they are securing their revenues and I would expect less volatile earnings reports as a result of this.Looking at the  for ALB, I think it has managed to make some very solid improvements since December 31, 2022. The total assets have grown by almost $4 billion, a large leap upwards. This has come largely from inventory levels rising in anticipation of stronger prices I think. What I am worried about though is that high inventory levels are going to backfire and ALB will be left to cut production instead and resuming could cause some slightly temporarily higher operating expenses.The lithium market has proven to be very volatile and investing in it brings some inherent risks. However, I think that over the long term, prices will appreciate and ALB will be able to yield even higher earnings. The company is continuing to diversify its portfolio of revenue streams and the acquisition of Liontown is yet another. ALB has shrunk over 30% in the last 12 months in terms of the share price. I think we are finding a bottom here and will be starting to head higher eventually. My view on ALB is a buy right now.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Paramount Resources: Back To Growth," () is a family-owned company that took an unusual way to get where it is today. Now that the company has ""arrived"" the cash flow is such that management is highly unlikely to repeat the past. Still the pastAs , the family controls enough stock to effectively run the company for the foreseeable future. The company is effectively debt free from a net debt standpoint. The cash flowThe forecast for the current year has been adjusted for the effects of the wildfires that have been an issue in Canada for a significant part of the fiscal year. That production has not been lost. But it has been delayed. The wildfires also slowed development activity as well. The sizable jump in projected production assumes no similar event in the next fiscal year.This company has long taken a lease position where no one else is (meaning they generally grab raw acreage) at the moment and developed that position for sale at a certain point. Management also owns positions in other companies, both public and private, that the company may acquire or sell the position as market conditions dictate. In some ways, this company functions more like an upstream mutual fund.The industry in general may be ""in the area"". But this company rarely purchases anything that is developed. Management did buy Apache Canada some years back and that has given the management a lot of work to turn that purchase around. It would appear that work is about to pay off big time.Probably the difference this time around is that there are several projects generating a lot of cash flow and free cash flow. Before, management would develop a project and then sell that project. The proceeds were used to develop the next project. Generally, the company always retained some production. But the retained production levels were nothing close to the total production before the sale.This business strategy was acceptable prior to 2015 when a lot of companies were doing the same thing. However, management had to change direction and fortunately, was able to get the company to a debt free situation with a lot of production. Going forward, any sales that take place will likely not entail all the production (unless management sells the whole company). Therefore, there will be some cash flow to support future developments as well as the cash received from the sale.The most significant change in business strategy over the years has been a transition from a dry gas producer to a rich gas producer. The liquids have added an important profitability contributor to the revenue stream. Recent well payback periods have largely remained under one year. That is extremely good in the upstream world.Canada has an important cost advantage over the United States in that acreage in Canada is often dirt cheap in prime areas when compared to United States prices. As a result, the location cost of a well in Canada is often insignificant compared to cost in the United States for similar acreage.These wells are profitable enough that there is plenty of room for the hostile environment of a cyclical downturn. The company has emphasized the production of condensate which often sells for a premium to light oil in Canada. Not only are the payback periods unusually short, but the profitability of the wells happens under a wide variety of industry conditions. This is a company that typically reports profits well into a cyclical downturn and is one of the first to ""bounce back"" during a recovery.The short payback period allows for a dividend payment, an occasional variable payment, share repurchases from time to time, and production growth. Very few companies can do all that at one time.The priority for the foreseeable future will be low debt (or no debt at all) and production growth. That should support the base dividend to a greater extent than is the case with much of the industry that cannot grow while the balance sheet is repaired.This company has a significant investment in both wholly owned subsidiaries, private and public companies.As the notes to the slide make clear, investors wanting the full details of all the investments made need to look at the quarterly report. What is shown above is intended to be a significant summary of what is important to management at the current time.Management will either acquire some of these companies or will sell positions as market conditions dictate. Wholly owned investments are actively managed, and some are closely coordinated with company activities.Oftentimes, this is the place where investors can look for potential future projects if something gets sold. The company has long not kept higher cost production. When project profitability hits the peak area, the project is often marketed so that management can reinvest in a new project. Therefore, it seldom has to deal with significant plugging and abandonment issues.Investors can expect that unlike the past, debt is likely to remain low (or not at all) in the future. Production has now reached the point where major projects can be sold and new projects developed without the need to borrow money.Sometimes the market does not like this cycle because production will decline with the periodic sale of major projects. But now cash flow and receipt of proceeds from the sale should enable a quick production recovery without financial leverage. As the company grows, those periodic sales will become less significant. That should enable smoother, more reliable growth that the market favors.The base dividend has been growing rapidly. That is likely to continue with the growth of production. This unusually profitable company can grow production and the dividend at the same time. That means that while growth of production has a high priority, investors can expect an overall base dividend that rapidly increases in the future as long as the growth story remains intact.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

My Top 5 Lithium Juniors,"In the History Channel's dramatized program, historian commenting on John D. Rockefeller summarized his strategy: ""."" This quote somewhat remindsBefore I provide my detailed list of the Top 5 Lithium Juniors, some background on my approach and focus is in order:Here is this list with what I think are the most relevant details.Two points before I discuss these specific companies:First, obviously Patriot Battery Metals (; is not worth less than $0. My valuation method is signaling that the stock is worth significantly less than its current market capitalization perhaps the company produces a preliminary economic study with more details (e.g., CAPEX, production targets). More on this below in the subsection dedicated to the company.Second, if you think my total costs are too high, then take a look at the Total Costs for Albemarle () with its integrated production from the best brine and spodumene deposits in the world. (This may be the topic of a future article for me.) Moreover, Albemarle's 2027 targets imply a total cost of $19,000 per tonne. Under these economic scenarios, these projects still end up with net margins in the mid-20% to mid-30% range. My broader, long-term view on the lithium industry is that we are going to see higher prices and higher costs than consensus.Australian-based Green Technology Metals is targeting an ambitious, multi-deposit, integrated project in Ontario.Green Tech is led by CEO Luke Cox who was involved in the development of the Wodgina spodumene deposit in Australia. The  boasts Chairman John Young who was co-founder and Executive Director of Pilbara Minerals (; PLS.AX) and Executive Director Cameron Henry who helped Primero Group earn recognition for its expertise in developing lithium processing facilities around the world. otes:Beyond this, Lithium Americas has taken a 5% stake in the company and I can envision them eventually trying to partner or buy the company to expand their North American footprint beyond Thacker Pass.I have estimated initial CAPEX of $2.5 billion for Green Tech to deliver its fully integrated goals. This could be aggressive and is the key risk to my view. The company will soon deliver a preliminary economic assessment which will shine light on this, followed by a feasibility study next year which provide even more details. The individual investor will most likely have time to pull the trigger quickly when these details are announced before a potential big swing—up or down—in the shares. Although, with a $70m market cap, I don't see much downside and the shares are approaching longer term support. Here is the log chart:The Directors and Management own a little over 7% of the company.The U.S. does not have any significant amount of domestic lithium production. Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is destined to change that. Its recent separation from Lithium Argentina reflects how seriously management is taking the U.S. move to develop its own domestic supply chain.LAC's $300+ million cash position speaks loudly for the strength of its leadership team. President & CEO John Evans previously held executive and operational management roles with FMC's lithium division (as an interesting aside, he just sold a big chunk of Lithium Argentina () shares). VP of Growth & Product Strategy Rene Leblanc is highly regarded. He has 17 years of experience in lithium process development, operations, and battery supply chain development including with FMC's lithium division and with Tesla ().LAC has  a lithium testing facility in Nevada which Mining.com noted:This is not something that a Junior does unless they have serious technical capabilities. The reference to """" is also interesting as it speaks to the longer term ambitions of the company.LAC's technical capabilities could eventually be further leveraged through an eventual acquisition of Green Tech. Its management has a history of making wise, strategic investments in Resources on the cheap (e.g., Arena Minerals, Millennial Lithium, and Green Tech) instead of buying high with shareholder capital at the top like Albemarle with Liontown and Patriot.LAC as a 2-phase strategy to produce 80,000 tonnes of LCE in Nevada using commonly used (i.e., highly likely to work) processing technologies and not some unproven (i.e., gimmick) process which is an important consideration, especially since this will likely be the world's first major clay project.General Motors () is the largest shareholder and Thacker Pass may end up being a significant source of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) compliant lithium for its domestic EV supply chain.Brine projects get no respect in the current market environment and Australian-based Galan has the highest grade brine resource in Argentina. Its flagship project Hombre Muerto project sits adjacent to the other producing Hombre Muerto projects controlled by Livent (), Alkem (; AKE.AX; AKE.TO), and POSCO (). Galan's Board includes Non-Executive Director Daniel Jimenez who has 28 years of experience with lithium major SQM (). Its management team includes lithium consulting, exploration, and geological expertise from time spent at Alkem, Lake Resources (), NEO Lithium, and SQM.Galan's strategy is to gradually scale production to 60,000 tonnes. This will take quite some time and brine expansions are notorious for taking longer than expected. Because of this, I'm only targeting the 20,000 tonnes of LCE from the first phase of production but also significantly less CAPEX.The Directors and Management own 13% of the company.Everyone who reads financial news knows who Australian-based Liontown is now. I have them ranked #4 due to limited valuation upside, but they have a huge high grade Resource at Kathleen Valley and strong management. Their only weakness would seem to be the technical capability required to integrate and produce the refined product. Albemarle would have been a logical acquirer in this respect. Hancock Prospecting won't help here. At present, the company is analyzing a potential downstream partnership with Sumitomo (; ), as stated :Liontown is expected to ship its first ore soon so time is running out on this company continuing to be included in my junior list. This is one to keep an eye on longer term though.A solid 17% of shares are held by the Board and Management.Shares of Patriot soared last year after significant high grade drill results at its Corvette project in James Bay, Quebec led to an Inferred spodumene Resource which is now the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Note that the Resource size I used above is only a higher grade portion of the overall, much larger Resource.Patriot is Chaired by Ken Brinsden who was previously the CEO of Pilbara Minerals and thus knows a lot about building a large scale spodumene operation. Like Liontown, Patriot doesn't have any notable technical expertise when it comes to refined lithium processing and a potential takeover would likely be the best option for shareholders. Moreover, this appears to be the strategy of the company, keep drilling to define a very large, high-grade Resource and then sell out. A lot of this is baked into the valuation cake.Patriot has yet to produce an economic study. Importantly, this will shine some light on the potential capital costs to develop the project. Patriot can likely benefit from hydroelectric power but it is in Northern Quebec which could present labor challenges.Board and management only owns about 2% of the company.My rational for ranking Patriot a sell is (1) rich valuation, (2) uncertainties remaining around project economics and permitting challenges, namely around the requirement to partially drain a lake, and (3) lack of any path to becoming an integrated producer (on its own). This is definitely one to watch though because once solid amount economic studies have been completed, a buyer could quickly emerge. Potential acquirers have to be cognizant of the former Nemaska disaster in Quebec where there was an embarrassing lack of due diligence completed. This could lead to a slower acquisition process.Lithium shares are in free fall but a nice buying opportunity is coming. Two gauges that I am watching to help me determine when are the  log charts of Albemarle and Mineral Resources (; ; MIN.AX), shown here:Albemarle has huge long-term support at $110 which points to the potential for another ~20% or so of downside given the downside momentum that we are seeing.Just like Albemarle, MinRes also has about 20% more downside to its significant long-term support. I also eyeballed the monthly charts of SQM and Pilbara Minerals and they have similar downside potential.I think long-term investors should consider initial or additional stakes in Green Tech, LAC, and Galan as this bottoming process occurs.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Microvast: The Management Is Selling, And So Should You","Continuing in my analysis of companies involved in the lithium battery world, I have chosen to study Microvast Holdings () this time around. This is a small company headquartered in Colorado, specializing in designing and producingSince its debut on NASDAQ, Microvast shares have lost over 80% of their value. In this analysis, I aim to answer a question: Is this a golden opportunity to buy at a very low valuation, or is the downtrend set to continue over the coming years?In my opinion, it's not a good company to invest in, as it lacks at least one of the two critical factors to succeed in the long term in the EV battery sector: it neither has revolutionary technology, nor is it aContrary to what I suggested , where I even proposed a short sell, in this case, I'll limit myself to saying that there are better companies for our capital. For instance, I recently revisited  and believe it to be a much more intriguing small-cap within the same sector, with huge potential for an asymmetric bet.All of Microvast's batteries are designed in Colorado. Production takes place in centers located in China (Huzhou), Europe (Berlin), and the United States. Operations in the USA are split between ESS system assembly in Windsor, Colorado, and battery production in Clarksville, Tennessee. The Clarksville center is not yet ready, but it is expected to start limited production in Q4 and then become fully operational by 2024.Over time, Microvast began producing various batteries, with its first successful models emerging in 2020. Currently, however, 80% of the backlog concerns the latest 53.5 amp model. Quoting from the recent :In addition to producing battery cells, Microvast can also assemble battery modules and packs. The battery packs can be customized according to needs: in the US, they are primarily required for battery storage operations, while in Europe, demand mainly comes from heavy vehicle manufacturers.Below are the main figures related to Microvast's income statement over the past few years (data in $ million, source: Seeking Alpha):As one can see, revenues and margins have been on a roller coaster for the past 5 years. Depending on market conditions, a battery was more or less in demand, and a facility could benefit from tax incentives or not. 2023 has been another year of very moderate growth so far, but a new boom is expected next year: as of June 30, 2023, Microvast's backlog was 600+% higher than that of June 30, 2022, standing at 675 million dollars.The volatility in revenue and margins comes precisely from the product mix. At this particular historical moment, the 53.5-amp battery has enjoyed great commercial success, and Microvast manages to sell it with good margins. Almost all of the backlog depends on this single product which, like every other battery in the market, will face increasing competition in the coming months.Let's now turn to the data on financial solidity:As can be seen, the company has essentially used the proceeds from its stock market listing to finance its capital expenditure. Most of the funds were used to expand the production facility in Colorado, so as to assemble the ESS units there and take advantage of the tax incentives of section 45x of the IRA, and to build the new plant in Tennessee.Here is a table showing the most relevant valuation multiples for Microvast, compared to other battery producers. Most of the competitors are in one of two situations: they are either small/micro-cap companies in a pre-revenue stage, or big consolidated manufacturers. Since it would be of little value to compare the multiples of pre-revenue companies, for my comparison I opted for the big manufacturers.I could not use the P/E ratio, since Microvast is still unprofitable. Judging by the data, I would much rather on Samsung SDI than Microvast. Also, we should not forget that gross margins for Microvast have been very volatile in the past while Samsung have kept theirs very steady in a 17-21% range.The EV battery market shares many similarities with the traditional battery and semiconductor markets. In the initial market expansion phase, there is a huge demand for companies focusing on R&D and OEM manufacturers. Gradually, technological and production leaders consolidate, leading to a handful of major companies dominating the market: TSMC, Intel, AMD, Duracell, and so on.We are still in the first phase of the market's expansion, where many downstream companies in the supply chain need to secure any available quality battery to keep up with vehicle production rates. Having slightly below-average technology and slightly above-average prices is still enough to generate large industrial orders. This is true for electric cars and even more so for heavy vehicles, where all major manufacturers have simultaneously embarked on their race to electrification in the past two years.Given that Microvast's annual revenue is less than half a billion dollars, the chances of it becoming a volume production leader are extremely slim. At this point, comparing its production volumes to giants like CATL, LG, SK Innovation, BYD, or Tesla is irrelevant. The other competitive front, technology, is also where I have serious reservations.As mentioned, the 53.5 ampere/hour battery is Microvast's flagship product. It's quite telling that they use this uncommon metric to identify their product, given that the EV industry has been shifting more towards Wh and Wh/kg. Here's a brief refresher of high school physics lessons:A 53.5 ampere/hour battery isn't particularly special. For three years now, Samsung SDI has been selling batteries for heavy vehicles with capacities of 60 ampere/hour and even .In practical terms, Microvast's technology is not particularly innovative. Its batteries have an energy density of , while CATL can produce batteries with , and LG has been offering 60-ampere batteries with an energy density of  for years. Energy density tells us how much power we gain for every extra kilo of batteries we install in our vehicle; it's not particularly relevant for ESS systems, as weight is a less significant variable.Moreover, Microvast is less efficient than its competitors in battery pack assembly. Once installed in 398 kg battery packs, the system's energy density significantly . This indicates that the battery connection and control system is heavier compared to more efficient competitors like BYD and SK Innovation, in addition to the ones already mentioned.Clearly, being a technological leader is not essential when there aren't enough batteries on the market, but the situation is changing rapidly:These are just three examples, driven by the fact that it's not easy to find sources related to the activities of Chinese manufacturers. It's easy to imagine that hard work is also being done on the other side of the Pacific to produce batteries for heavy-duty vehicles, further increasing the competition for Microvast.Everything we've said so far can be precisely replicated for battery storage, an extremely competitive market where Tesla is widely establishing itself as a leader in innovation and production. Again, Microvast cannot compete with the production levels of Elon Musk's company; moreover, it does not have disruptive technology capable of conquering the market with its performance.This is all without considering that we will soon witness the large-scale commercialization of solid-state batteries, a sector in which Microvast has not even announced any ongoing R&D projects. Toyota is  the first car with SSB in 2025,  and  are ready for large-scale production, and by 2028,  will be ready to transition almost entirely to this type of battery. Major announcements of this kind have also come from , which should anticipate SK in 2026.Exactly in line with when Microvast's management predicts the company will start making profits, it's also expected that its technology will become extremely uncompetitive.Microvast's technology is not particularly advanced, and its production capacity is significantly lower than that of larger competitors, who invest billions for each battery production plant. Consider that the top 10 EV battery manufacturers, at the end of 2022, held a . The company has managed to carve out a niche in a less crowded market, taking advantage of the electric truck boom at a time when battery manufacturers are not ready to keep up with demand or offer specialized products.Over the months, however, this market gap is increasingly being filled by competitors able to benefit from large economies of scale and hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually on research and development. All this while the advent of SSBs is approaching, and Microvast has no ready answer. Given all this, I see no concrete reason to buy the stock today.My analysis might prove wrong if:However, these are all hypotheses I wouldn't be ready to invest in. I believe the company's fundamental problems remain, and there are no significant reasons to keep Microvast shares in the portfolio.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

First Majestic Silver: A Disappointing Q3,"The Q3 Earnings Season for the Silver Miners Index () is just around the corner and one of the first companies to release its preliminary results is First Majestic Silver (). And whileFirst Majestic Silver (""First Majestic"") released its Q3 production results this week, reporting quarterly production of ~6.29 million SEOs made up of ~2.46 million ounces of silver and ~46,700 ounces of gold. This translated to a significant decline from the year-ago period, with SEO production down 28% year-over-year. In fairness, the bulk of the decline was because of lapping production from Jerritt Canyon in the year-ago period, which has since moved into care & maintenance. However, while the company can get a pass from a comparison standpoint, it wasn't forced to make the Jerritt Canyon acquisition, and it's certainly put a severe dent in its per share metrics given the dilution related to the deal (~26.7 million shares).Digging into the results a little closer, much of this decline came from the company's lower cost San Dimas Mine which doesn't paint a splendid picture for Q3 margins, especially when combined with the Mexican Peso which continued to trend higher for most of Q3 vs. the US Dollar () and averaged its lowest price in years at ~17.1 MXN/USD vs. ~17.7 in Q2 2023. The lower production at San Dimas resulted from much lower grades, with silver and gold grades slipping to 237 grams per tonne of silver and 2.71 grams per tonne of gold, respectively, down from 289 grams per tonne and 4.1 grams per tonne in the year-ago period. And while increased throughput offset this (~213,700 tonnes), I would expect much higher costs year-over-year at San Dimas with the asset up against tough comps, relying on higher tonnes to maintain the ~3.0 million ounce production level (Q2 2022: ~3.78 million SEOs), and higher labor costs.Fortunately, the company's #2 Santa Elena Mine had a solid quarter, benefiting from increased grades and throughput, plus a boost to gold recoveries which improved from 92% (Q3 2022) and 94% (Q2 2023) to 95% with the commissioning of its dual-circuit plant, a 300 basis point improvement. The result of the higher gold grades was that the mine saw a ~13% increase in silver production and ~6% increase in gold production despite being up against difficult comps in the year-ago period from the start of production at Ermitano. That said, while the mine will benefit from slightly higher production, I would still expect this to be a relatively high-cost quarter given the sticky inflationary pressures.Finally, at the company's smallest La Encantada Mine, there wasn't much to write home about here either. This is because the mine saw a ~27% decline in silver production to ~566,000 ounces, down from ~779,000 ounces in the year-ago period. First Majestic noted that the lower production was related to the collapse of one well, which affected water availability, and that production would normalize once construction of the replacement well is complete, which began in September. On a positive note, First Majestic is still on track to meet downward revised guidance despite the weaker Q3 results year-over-year, tracking at ~75% of its guidance midpoint of 26.2 to 27.8 million SEOS.As for recent developments, the weakness in the silver price certainly doesn't help the outlook for Q4, especially when the company's costs are likely to remain elevated year-over-year despite turning off its highest-cost operation, Jerritt Canyon. This is because while the Mexican Peso has finally given up some ground vs. the US Dollar after a near parabolic rally from December 2022 through August 2023, it's still sitting at ~10% higher levels year-over-year. Meanwhile, the outlook for profit-sharing and wages has arguably worsened, with Newmont () caving in to an 8% raise for the National Union of Mine, Metal and Allied Workers of the Mexican Republic earlier this month. And while this doesn't mean that wages must go up for other mines, it certainly isn't an ideal development for mining companies in Mexico hoping for easing pressure from a labor standpoint.Meanwhile, from a reserve growth standpoint, First Majestic continues to have some of the shorter mine lives among its peer group and especially when compared to Hecla () and the combination of a weaker silver price, sticky inflationary pressures and rising Mexican Peso certainly isn't ideal. This is because the company may need to increase cut-off grades yet again at year-end 2023, providing a greater hurdle to moving ounces into mine plans. Adding insult to injury, reserves per share will likely decline yet again, with it being hard to be optimistic about reserve growth this year and the company seeing further share dilution with ~13 million shares sold under its ATM in H1 2023 alone. So, with it being hard to rule out further M&A after the disappointment at Jerritt Canyon, which didn't give AG its desired diversification/production boost because of being shut down temporarily and declining per share metrics already, I continue to see AG as an Avoid.Based on ~302 million fully diluted shares and a share price of US$5.00, First Majestic trades at a market cap of ~$1.51 billion. This continues to leave it as one of the highest capitalization producers in the silver space despite it having most of its NAV tied to Mexico, a jurisdiction that is dropping in ranks from an investment attractiveness (Jerritt Canyon in care & maintenance) and it being one of the lower-margin producers sector-wide. And if we compare this to an estimated net asset value of ~$640 million, leaving it trading at over 2.0x P/NAV. Not only is this a premium to other Mexican silver producers like  () at ~0.80x, but also more expensive than Hecla Mining (), which trades at ~1.20x P/NAV with better margins and operates out of more attractive jurisdictions (Idaho, Alaska, Yukon, Quebec).If we look out across the universe of gold producers, AG's premium makes even less sense, with the stock trading at nearly double the P/NAV multiple of names like  () that have the bulk of their NAV tied to Canada (a top-tier jurisdiction) and will be one of the lowest-cost producers post-2025 once its P3+ Expansion is complete at Island. Hence, even if AG may be down ~70% from its highs, it's hard to argue for owning the stock from an investment standpoint with it still sitting at over 2.0x P/NAV and ~20.0x FY2024 free cash flow estimates (~$75 million).First Majestic Silver had a disappointing quarter in Q3, with lower production at two of three operations and a significant decline in production per share on a year-over-year basis with Jerritt Canyon moved into care & maintenance. And while this might not be as much of a blow if Jerritt Canyon had multiple ore sources nearby and could sit be a toll-treater for refractory ore while the company explores the property, it's off the beaten path from a haulage standpoint relative to other roasters like Gold Quarry and Goldstrike. This means that the company can't generate revenue toll-milling revenue while it works to explore the asset, and it also had to let go of several of its skilled workers when it moved the asset offline.Assuming the company had an exceptional asset in its portfolio to stomach this blow like Iamgold () which may have lost Rosebel but it has ~60% of Cote, this wouldn't be as big of a deal. However, none of First Majestic's assets are what I would consider world-class and one of the major benefits of the Jerritt Canyon (assumed it worked out) was that it diversified the company from a cash flow/NAV standpoint, and this is no longer the case, making the move into care & maintenance a double whammy that makes it even harder to justify the stock's premium multiple. To summarize, I continue to see AG as an inferior buy-the-dip candidate, and I continue to favor other names elsewhere in the sector trading at deeper discounts to fair value that are also hated.

The Tesla Dilemma: Juggling Growth And Competition,"() stock still offers investors lots of upside potential; the carmaker continues to defend some of the best technology in electric vehicles, or EVs, on both production efficiency and product features; in addition, the Tesla brand remains the However, reflecting on the latest developments in the global EV market, it becomes also evident that the Austin-based automotive company faces multiple challenges in its road to ""EV domination."" In this article, I will discuss my take on Tesla's (i) latest Model 3 launch, (ii) the broader price cuts/ price war, and the (iii) changing market share.Overall, while I continue to defend the position that Tesla remains one of the most exciting growth assets listed on the market, I also understand that the goldilocks days of easy growth, notablyIn context of the Munich IAA mobility event, held from September 5th to 10th, Tesla unveiled a new generation of its best-selling Model 3 car. On the design angle, the new Model 3 sports updated bumpers and lighting, as well as a somewhat revised interior. With regard to performance specs: the rear-wheel drive Model 3 has a 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) acceleration time of 6.1 seconds and a WLTP range of 319 miles (513 km). The Dual Motor Long Range variant is even more impressive with a 4.4-second 0-62 mph (100 km/h) time and a WLTP range of 391 miles (629 km). Both versions offer fast charging capabilities of 170 kW or 250 kW, providing up to 175 miles (282 km) of range in just 15 minutes when the battery is depleted.In my opinion, the new Model 3 launch is notable, because it is a welcome alternation in the carmakers strategy to fuel demand by simply cutting prices. With the new Model 3, Tesla may once again point with car buyers on product excitement, vs. price excitement. By the way, somehow Tesla's Model 3 update reminds me of Apple's () strategy with relaunching the iPhone over and over again, with minor tweaks. Tesla plans to sell the new Model 3 as early as 2024. And overall, early management commentary suggests that the new product my help to improve profitability by both lowering the cost of goods sold and increasing the selling price compared to the outgoing model.Tesla's new Model 3 launch is also important, because Tesla needs to update its (somewhat) older product portfolio to remain competitive with European and Chinese carmakers, who bring new models to the market at record pace. In other words, the times where Tesla was the only game in battery EV, or BEV, are over. In fact, in terms of global BEV sales and market share, Tesla's share now has dropped to only 15%, down from about 23% for the previous year.However, it is also important to note that the BEV market is still expanding rapidly, which renders the loss of market share less concerning. According to a research note by Morgan Stanley's equity research team (), the global BEV sales in July 2023 YTD vs. the same period in 2022 are up a remarkable 36%, growing to 5,075,089 BEV units sold in 2023 so far. The growing market is supported by higher penetration levels in all regions: the U.S. at 8.0%, Europe at 15.9%, and China at 22.8%.Finally, while BYD Company's () 17% market share has overtaken Tesla's, I would like to point out that Tesla is leading in the U.S. and Europe, while BYD is only leading in China, which is a more price sensitive market, although high volume.Looking beyond the new Model 3 excitement, I see Tesla's next growth leg supported by its next-gen vehicle platform, which could account for 4-7 million EVs produced by 2028/30, according to my estimates. For context, the next-gen platform is Tesla's most important hardware project right now, aiming to reduce production cost and efficiency for more aggressive EV volume scale. According to management guidance, the next-gen platform will be leveraged at plants around the world, and not only in Mexico as I have initially assumed. The platform is expected to be used for the production of the Cybertruck, Semi, and Roadster, as well as other future vehicles.Moreover, as the second major growth opportunity, Tesla continues to be working on FSD technology. In that context, Tesla's ambitions are likely to accelerate over the next 12 to 24 months, as the company is investing in AI and its Dojo supercomputer project. As an additional consideration when discussing FSD, I would also like to point out that Tesla has recently reduced the price of its FSD package from $15 tsd to $12 tsd, which could likely push adoption up by anywhere between 10% to 20%, I believe. But more data points are needed to see how penetration and gross profit maximization is optimized by price adjustments in FSD. Like in its pricing strategy for vehicles, Tesla is lately experimenting a lot with pricing. Thus, pricing on FSD may continue to evolve over the next few months; and personally, I would not be surprised if the starter package drops below the five figure benchmark.I see a challenging Q3 for Tesla: In my opinion, there could be downside risk to investors' expectations for volume and margin, reflecting planned summer production shutdowns which will push both production and deliveries down, while repeated, aggressive discounts on sales may limit profitability. Specifically, Tesla has recently estimated that both production and deliveries volume will likely be down in Q3 vs Q2, mostly driven by the discussed factory shutdowns around the globe. In that context, the company had about 16 days of sales in inventory in Q2, mostly in-transit vehicles, which may not be enough to offset the production impact from shutdowns happening in Q3.Tesla has so far never voiced any doubts to hitting the 1.8 million in deliveries target. But the data still suggests downside risk to the flattish deliveries consensus at present. And if volume is met, it might come at a considerable cost, e.g., pressuring profitability on purchase-inducing price cuts. In that context, Tesla also intends to manage the delivery mix between the Model 3 and Model Y by adjusting the pricing gaps between the two models on a weekly basis for specific regions to tailor to market-specific nuances on supply and demand.The manufacturing costs of Tesla's Austin and Berlin factories are improving on volume ramp ups; but overall scale effects are still well below Fremont at present. However, once Austin and Berlin reach more stabilized production levels, they will be able to implement cost reduction efforts. In my opinion, however, meaningful operating leverage from the Berlin/Austin factory ramp will not materialize prior to 2024.Regarding the Cybertruck, Tesla reiterated that the company is on track for start of production and deliveries in Q4, with 250k in target annual capacity. The vehicle is a product specific to the U.S. market, and management indicated that it is difficult to estimate how many Cybertrucks can be sold in 2023 and 2024, since it will also largely depend on the demand for its other vehicles.Tesla continues to be an exciting investment opportunity. However, it is important to recognize the evolving landscape of the global EV market, which presents both opportunities and challenges. A few considerations stand out: First, the recent launch of an updated Model 3, focusing on product quality rather than price reductions, indicates Tesla's commitment to sustainable growth; Second, While Tesla's global market share has dipped, the overall EV market is expanding rapidly, with Tesla maintaining leadership positions in the US and Europe; Third, investors should keep a close eye on Tesla's next-generation vehicle platform and Full Self-Driving technology, which hold the key to the company's future growth.While I see a few potential challenges in the short term, particularly in Q3, I advise investors to maintain a long-term perspective on Tesla; and, as long as the company maintains leadership in EV technology, as well as customer love, I recommend to remain invested.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Obsidian Energy outlines plan to raise production to 50K boe/day in three years,"Obsidian Energy ()  in early trading Thursday after unveiling a three-year plan that  by mid-2026, driven primarily by the development of its Peace River assets, which the company expects will increase toObsidian () said its three-year growth plan calls for capital spending of $380M, $445M and $420M in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, which is expected to generate free cash flow of $53M, $36M and $213M in each year.The company said its strategy for the three-year plan is to maintain production levels in its Willesden Green, Pembina and Viking light oil businesses, and use the significant free cash flow to fund growth in the Peace River heavy oil business until it becomes self funding in 2026.",19,2023-09-21T10:14:57.000-04:00
Barrick Gold: Easy Comps In Q3 Makes It A Buy Near Trough Multiples,"The Q2 Earnings Season has been a mixed one for the Gold Miners Index (), with rising operating costs mostly offsetting the record average realized gold price despite a pullback in diesel prices vs. peak levels last year. Plus, productionUnfortunately,  ()  weren't able to buck this trend, with declines in margins, free cash flow, and gold output on a year-over-year basis.However, as I'll explain below, Barrick has a much stronger H2 ahead, benefits from easy compsLet's take a closer look at the company's Q2 results below and why a rearview mirror approach is the wrong one to take, with several factors working in Barrick's favor from now on.Barrick Gold released its  this week, reporting quarterly production of ~1.01 million ounces of gold, a 3% decline from the year-ago period. The slide in gold production was related to a softer quarter at Pueblo Viejo, with tie-in work on the nearly completed Expansion Project (14.0 million tonnes per annum) throttling output, lower production at Cortez related to mine sequencing and Turquoise Ridge, where planned autoclave maintenance was completed and autoclave processing was much lower at ~424,000 tonnes. This was partially offset by higher recoveries and throughput at Kibali and a slightly better quarter at its 61.5% owned Carlin Complex due to significantly higher average grades (4.55 grams per tonne of gold) that benefited from higher open-pit grades.Unfortunately, the higher production at these two key assets was unable to pick up the slack. Despite a better quarter, costs at the NGM joint-venture came in at elevated levels of $1,388/oz.Although this is disappointing, it's important to remember that Barrick guided for back-end weighted production so the fact that it's tracking at ~46.6% of its annual guidance midpoint should not be alarming. And while the above chart clearly shows a steady decline in quarterly gold production, investors must not lose sight of the fact that Barrick will see a significant step-up in production at Pueblo Viejo (60%) going forward, with the plant expansion expected to result in production north of 600,000 ounces attributable to Barrick next year (~150,000 ounce quarterly average) and ~135,000 attributable ounces form 2024-2027, translating to a 75% and 95% growth increase from the depressed levels in Q2 2023 (~77,000 ounces produced at $1,219/oz). The result should be lower costs and significantly higher free cash flow from this asset, one key pillar to Barrick's turnaround that's already set in motion.Plus, elsewhere in the portfolio, H1 2023 should have been a better period if the Record of Decision at Goldrush was not delayed (allowing for it to start ramping up) and Porgera had been restarted in line with more optimistic expectations. However, the ROD at Goldrush is expected by year-end and this is an incredible asset, expected to produce over 400,000 ounces per annum once it reaches commercial production by 2026. Meanwhile, Porgera finally looks to be closing in on the finish line in terms of a restart, and both of these assets will help increase production, and both are lower-cost assets. So, with H2 being stronger for Barrick and 2024 expected to be a better year, I would expect consistent sequential and year-over-year growth in production for Barrick going forward, with a more material step up in output in 2025 to 4.5+ million ounces of gold (4.2 million ounce guidance midpoint in 2022).As highlighted in Barrick's MD&A, the Goldrush ROD is now expected in Q4 2023, but underground and development has continued under the Horse Canyon/Cortez Unified Exploration Project POA in the meantime, with a minor modification by the Bureau of Land Management approved to allow for an additional ~635,000 tonnes of waste to be placed on the existing waste rock storage facility near CHOP (allowing underground development to continue into mid-2024).Unfortunately, the better forward outlook doesn't help Barrick's recently reported Q2 financial results, with revenue coming in at ~$2.83 billion (down 1% year-over-year), operating cash flow coming in at $832 million (down 10% year-over-year), and free cash flow plunging to just $63 million, with trailing-twelve-month free cash flow now barely positive. This is certainly not what one wants to see from a ~$20.0 billion company, but like production, there are nuances here that are important to consider.For starters, the gold price has spent its 21st consecutive week above the $1,900/oz level (a new record), suggesting that higher gold prices might be here to stay. Second, capital expenditures are up sharply on a trailing-twelve-month basis vs. Q2 2022 (~$3.14 billion vs. $2.61 billion). Third, near peak inflationary pressures have impacted profitability but appear to be easing finally, which will all translate to improve margins and free cash flow in H2 2023 and 2024.While the production results showed moderate declines, Barrick's cost performance wasn't much better from a headline standpoint. This is because all-in sustaining costs [AISC] came in at $1,355/oz (up 12% year-over-year), and while they pulled back from their peak hit in Q1 ($1,370/oz), they were a little higher than I anticipated. The good news was that Barrick's average realized gold price helped to offset the impact of higher costs, with AISC margins only down slightly at $617/oz vs. the $649/oz reported in Q2 2022.Still, these margins were slightly below my estimates of $625/oz, and continue to remain well below the levels Barrick enjoyed in 2020 when the stock outperformed the market with a 23% return in 2020. However, the higher costs were related to lower production from its low-cost Pueblo Viejo Mine, fewer ounces sold than produced in the period, and another quarter of relatively high mine site sustaining capital ($524 million). However, as I stated in my previous update on Barrick in July, it's important not to take a rearview mirror approach on costs and margins:Meanwhile, if we look at the bigger picture, Barrick's all-in sustaining costs should improve to sub $1,150/oz in FY2024, benefiting from higher production overall, the benefit of increased production from lower-cost assets (Goldrush, Pueblo Viejo), and more normalized sustaining capital expenditures vs. another elevated year of sustaining capital in FY2023 (2023 guidance: attributable sustaining capital of $1.45 billion to $1.70 billion). Just as importantly, several producers have discussed easing of inflationary pressures, another potential tailwind if this trend continues.So, even if we assume conservative AISC of $1,170/oz in FY2024 and a similar average realized gold price of $1,970/oz (2023 estimates: $1,960/oz), Barrick's AISC margins will improve from $573/oz in FY2022 to $800/oz in FY2024. This is a massive improvement and should help to shift sentiment surrounding the stock.In fact, if Barrick were to report AISC margins of $800/oz (2024), which I believe is achievable, its margins would only be 1% shy of its FY2020 AISC margins of $811/oz which briefly saw the stock soar to new multi-year highs at $31.20 per share. And while I think banking on a return to $31.00 per share is a stretch in the next 18 months, I think a target of $24.00 is quite achievable (50% total return), which would place Barrick at less than 9x FY2024 cash flow per share estimates ($2.85) and barely 16x free cash flow. I see these as very reasonable multiples for the world's second-largest producer, especially given that its margin and free cash flow figures should improve even further in 2025 with another massive year out of Pueblo Viejo, a full year of production from Goldrush, a full year of production from Porgera, and guidance for declining total capital expenditures for its gold business, as highlighted below.Finally, while Barrick Gold may be considered a producer in less favorable jurisdictions by some investors or a low-growth company, it's important to note that the company actually has over 45% of production from Tier-1 ranked jurisdictions (Nevada, Ontario). Meanwhile, while it has seen a decline in production over the past several years because of divestments (KCGM 50%), Lagunas Norte, Morila), assets winding down (Long Canyon, Golden Sunlight), and Porgera being placed in care & maintenance, Barrick set to return to growth. This is because Pueblo Viejo will enjoy a much larger production profile with the 14.0 million tonne per annum expansion, it has massive growth projects in Lumwana Super Pit and Reko Diq to grow gold-equivalent ounce production, Porgera will be restarted, and Cortez will also seeing growing production this decade (Robertson, Goldrush) even without factoring in growth from Hanson and Fourmile.1. It's nearly as  as it was in September 2022 before staging a major reversal, trading at just ~5.6x FY2024 cash flow per share estimates at a share price of US$16.00.2. It has  in Q3 2023 as it laps peak production and it has easy comps on deck on a full year basis as we head into 2024 with 2023 being weighed down by delayed production at Goldrush, elevated mine-site sustaining capital, and lower gold production.3. The company is finally set to begin seeing  both from gold and copper, with major growth projects being investigated in its copper business and key projects nearing the finish line in its gold business (PV Expansion, Goldrush ramp-up, Porgera restart).4. The company is opportunistically buying back shares, continues to grow resources and reserves, and is benefiting from a higher gold price, all pointing to  with the hard work by previous Randgold CEO Mark Bristow finally starting to be realized and show up in its results.Barrick Gold may be out of favor today, but with margins, free cash flow and production all set to rise materially, I would expect this to translate to improved sentiment for Barrick going forward.So, while rearview mirror statistics (declining production, rising costs, paltry free cash flow generation) might prompt some to steer clear of Barrick, this makes little sense when easy comps are finally in place and the company is set to see a significant improvement in its financial results going forward, even if gold prices lose the $1,900/oz level. In summary, with the stock hovering below US$16.00 following a largely telegraphed weak Q2 report (pre-reported) and trading near its most attractive valuation levels in years outside of Q3 2022 and Q1 2020, I see the stock as a Buy.

Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),"Over most of the past year, I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies, given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads. I  my long-term bullish take on MarathonHowever, as discussed more recently (), I've downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash "" in the ""crack spread."" As such, it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon, considering its stock remains generally high. However, its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon, particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines. The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk, as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopolitical-related production cuts. Overall, investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets, potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum, depending on how we calculate its forward valuation.For the most part, refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets, where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly. My long-term view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today. That said, the short-term outlook has changed as volatility mounts, raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline. See below:The first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022. However, oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around $87 per barrel today. Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil . Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped. Marathon has retained much of its value, but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income. The ""crack spread"" is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs. crude oil has crashed, particularly for the gasoline spread. See below:The heating oil spread remains high today, but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range. It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases, making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profit.Luckily, Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread. See its most recent analysis below:Since the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of ~$32/barrel to ~$19/barrel today. That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above. All else being equal, this $12/barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of -$12.96 annualized ($3.24B quarterly).  have only changed marginally over this period. Natural gas has also hardly changed, so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathon's refining margins.The company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023. However, this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathon's current EBITDA. See below:Historically, Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around $15, depending on changes in other operating costs. Today, that spread is below its typical range before COVID-19, indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability. The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around $1.5B per quarter from its Midstream segment. In comparison, its refining margins can vary from negative  (seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage). Its refining segment EBITDA was $3.16B in Q2 and may be as low as -$80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant. Combined with an expected +$1.5B from Midstream, I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at ~$1.42B, given limited changes in commodity prices and volumes.Marathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the . I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period. The spread averaged  during most of that period, or about $5 greater than the previous quarter. All else being equal, that equates to a ~+$1.35B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2, giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of ~$5.66B.Marathon's Depreciation and Amortization has run around $830M, and its interest is currently around $142M quarterly. Together, this creates an extra $972M added quarterly cost. Considering this, I project Marathon's Q3 pre-tax income at $4.67B, or ~$3.7B after taxes (~21% historically). The company usually has ~$350M in income attributable to non-controlling interests, giving a final net income estimate of $3.35B or an EPS of $8.38. This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at $7.48.For Q4, based on current prices, its EBITDA outlook is  lower at $1.42B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month. That equates to an estimated pre-tax income of $448M, or $353 after tax, and almost zero after non-controlling interest (~$4M, or a $0.01 EPS). The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at $4.53 EPS; however, those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downside.These estimates do not account for one-off costs, gains, or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market. I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathon's volumes will also remain constant. With hurricane season in full swing, refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels. Further, the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index I've used. The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically, so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA; however, it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates, potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to $7.5 and a Q4 nearer to $1.On Monday morning, both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 3-4%, indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk. While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities, I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand. As mentioned in my , the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies. Potentially, the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor. See below:EV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1%, that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive. Further, the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today, with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand. While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect, it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower. See below:Again, a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread. In my previous article regarding Marathon, my long-term view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade (and today in particular) would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil, contributing to a permanently higher crack spread. Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains, partially due .In the long run, I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline, leading to higher crack spreads. However, the short-term situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to . Further, the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue, particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasons.Gasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding. That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut. However, oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release. Of course, no more reserves will come out of the SPR, which has lost around half its previous storage levels. See below:We must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues. Currently, it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate, and most lack the information relevant to make that determination. Still, if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened, then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur. This potential "","" exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves (both strategic and commercial), could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel, considering it is . Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time. Still, gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices, mainly if it is already falling with the economy today.The US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC+ production cuts, offsetting the recovery in US oil production. That said, the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last. See below:As the rig count declines, future oil supplies should trend lower. That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline. Further, a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies, potentially harming Marathon's steadier income stream.At this point, it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count. Further, should global oil supplies decline enough, the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market. That said, I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon. I believe oil's bullish case has become much stronger, while gasoline is not nearly as solid, pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spread.At today's commodity prices, I believe Marathon's EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time. Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation, and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels. In the long run, I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil. However, in the short term, I believe MPC has ample 12-month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinery-margin profit decline shock.Looking forward, I expect MPC's Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer. However, from Q4, I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread. In my view, depending on how the oil market's situation changes, an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies. For this reason, I am bearish on MPC on a 12-month outlook basis. Its EPS may be around $-1 to $2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today, potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward ""P/E"" of ~30X.I rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period, but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable. I still like the stock from a long-term perspective, but not at its current price, given the immediate profit decline. To me, the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war,  global recession, causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer. If MPC operates in a ""highly sensitive "" environment today, it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world. Thus, if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years, as I've expected, its long-term potential would also be minimal.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Texas Pacific Land's Management Issues Coming To An End,"Texas Pacific Land Corporation () has one of those outstanding business models that doesn't need great management to be successfully run, as we realized in its more recent history. Its management issues seem to be coming toTPL has been reducing its revenue volatility adding the Water Services segment, which has been growing at faster rates than production levels. I believe this is a really positive achievement for a company that depends so much on oil and gas prices. Even though I believe those are positive steps in improving an already high-quality business, as I will show in this article, the company is currently overvalued, unless production volumes continue to rise in theTexas Pacific Land Corporation is the successor to the Texas Pacific Land Trust,  upon the bankruptcy of the Texas and Pacific Railway (T&P). 3.5 million acres of land were put into a trust for the benefit of bondholders who invested in the railroad, and in 1920 oil was discovered in the Permian Basin. A few years later, the first pipeline was built and TPL was listed in the NYSE in 1927.During the next decades, the trust's mission was to generate revenues through oil and gas royalties and land sales (75% of acres have been sold since 1888), while returning the free cash flow to owners through dividends and buybacks. From the 1970s to 2010, the production has been in decline, but since 2015 new  allowed to access reserves that were previously too expensive to extract, boosting the oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin and TPL went from producing 1.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d) in 2014 to 24.9 during the . In 2017, TPL announced the formation of Texas Pacific Water Resources (TPWR), a wholly-owned subsidiary focused on providing water services to oil and gas operators to meet the increasing demand for water used in fracturing activities.Currently, TPL is  landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 886,000 surface acres, mainly in the Permian Basin. The company also owns non-participating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately 460,000 acres of land.To understand the most recent legal battle between some of TPL's managers and major shareholders, we have to go back and take a look at the governance structure that was in place before the transition to a corporation. TPL's Trust was managed by three trustees, and unlike in a corporation, they were not subject to annual elections and, in effect, were appointed for life. In February 2019, one of the three trustee positions opened up because of the resignation of Mr. Meyer, who was 83 at the time and served as a Trustee since 1991 and Chairman since 2003.The other two trustees (John R. Norris and David E. Barry) , a candidate with an honorable and distinguished career at the Air Force but little experience in the oil and gas sector and no skin in the game, while Horizon Kinetics LLC (HK), SoftVest L.P., and ART-FGT Family Partners (the ""Investor Group""), who at the time owned , nominated Eric Oliver, the President of SoftVest with extensive experience on the oil and gas industry in the Permian Basin.During the following months, the two remaining trustees and the Investors Group battled through proxy statements until in May  against Mr. Oliver, alleging failure to disclose background information and conflict of interests. At the time, Mr. Norris and Mr. Barry, who filled the lawsuit, had 1,300 equity securities, while Mr. Oliver held over 130,000 equity securities.The Investor Group responded by filing a motion in court alleging Mr. Barry was not validly elected back in 2017. In July 2019, TPL and the Investor Group reached a  in which they dismissed their litigations and included three new members on TPL's Conversion Exploration Committee formed during the year to study if the Trust should be converted into a C-Corporation. Murray Stahl (Chairman of HK) and Mr. Oliver joined the committee.The following year TPL announced it would convert into a corporation and in  was signed between TPL and the Investor Group, which originated the current legal issues. Since the long-term trustees didn't want to lose their decision power and they didn't have enough shares to decide, the agreement had some odd clauses. First of all, the nine board members were designated into three groups (I, II, or III), and the class III board members could only be dismissed for cause and could still serve even if they didn't get the necessary votes from the annual general meeting.The agreement also limited HK to owning more than 23.5% ownership in TPL (the ""Horizon Cap"") and SoftVest to owning over 4% (the ""SoftVest Cap"").Finally, and this is the point that triggered the current lawsuit is the voting commitment, which states that the Investor Group shall vote in accordance with the Board's recommendations, with the following exception:This point is what caused important issues when in September 2022 the  was released including an unconventional proposition to increase the number of shares (Proposal 4).This was an unconventional proposition because, since the foundation, the company has been receiving significant free cash flows and returning them to shareholders as stated before, and HK and SoftVest considered it an extraordinary transaction that changed the dynamics of the business.Management stated that the new shares would be used for a stock split since the company was trading over $2,700, but also acquisitions. Even though management didn't disclose more information about the acquisitions, they proposed to increase the number of shares from 7.75MM to 46.53MM shares. The 3-to-1 stock split proposed only required 23.13MM shares, leaving 23.4M shares for issuance.If those shares were to be issued at the $2,000 price that TPL was trading back in October 2022 ($666 per share after the split), it would represent over $15.42B.I fully understand HK and SoftVest's concerns, along with many other smaller shareholders, since the management had no significant experience in acquisitions, it would dilute ownership while creating an incentive to managers with low-skin-in-the-game that plays against shareholder value creation because of management's compensation structure.Management's compensation structure consists of a fixed base salary, a short-term incentive program based on Adjusted EBITDA margins, FCF per share, and strategic objectives, and a long-term incentive program. This compensation structure, even could looks fine at the beginning, includes many variables that are not controlled by management, since EBITDA margins are highly dependent on the price of oil and FCF per share doesn't necessarily create value for shareholders if there is no return on capital metric in place.Half of the long-term incentive program is time-based restricted stock units with a 3-year vesting period, and the stock ownership guidelines for executive management state the CEO should own x5 of its base salary, x2 times for other named executives and x1 for other executives, which seems low to align their interests with shareholders in my opinion.Before the meeting that was expected to be held 16th of November 2022, TPL's management  to support Proposal 4, while the biggest  the days before the meeting they were voting against and encouraging other shareholders to do so.Since it was clear that Proposal 4 was not going to succeed because of major shareholders' positions against and the most organized smaller shareholder base I have seen through the , the management adjourned the Annual Meeting and took legal actions against HK and SoftVest for not voting as recommended by management and not fulfilling the Stockholders Agreement.The trial was held on April 17, 2023, and the AGM finally took place in May 2023, where votes for Proposal 4 were , even though if HK and SoftVest had voted as recommended by management, the proposition would have succeeded. Post-trial oral arguments occurred in June 2023, and no ruling has been issued yet, so the results of this proposal will depend on the Delaware court ruling.To the surprise of TPL's shareholders, on the 1st of August TPL announced a  and a Cooperation Agreement, which might be the beginning to the end of this long management battle and reduce the cost of legal and professional fees for shareholders, which have been over $26.78MM during the 1H 2023, compared to $2.88MM the . The legal fees have been significantly higher for HK and SoftVest, since in addition to having to pay for his defense expenses, they have been also paying part of the accusation legal fees because of their large ownership. This new agreement terminates the original Stockholders Agreement and states that the two co-chairs Mr. Barry and Mr. Norris will retire from the board and will be substituted by two new independent members (Ms. Woung-Chapman and Mr. Roosa) with extensive experience in the oil and gas industry. Mr. Stahl and Mr. Oliver will remain on the board.Even the management hasn't ceased the lawsuit, which is the only point of the new agreement that I see concerning, in case Proposal 4 is approved, the new management board members will have to be careful not to upset HK and SoftVest, since from the 2023 AGM, which should happen before the end of the year, they will be free to vote. Since HK and SoftVest have been pushing for a long time for a reorganization of the company and aligning management interests with shareholders, I see this agreement as an important step toward better governance and value creation for shareholders.TPL's surface and royalty ownership allow it to generate revenues through the oil and gas value chain without committing large amounts of cash to an asset-intensive and highly cyclical industry. At the initial development phase where infrastructure is constructed, TPL receives fixed fee payments for the use of the land and revenue for sales of materials (Easements and surface-related revenue). During the drilling and completion phase, revenue comes from sourced or treated produced water (Water services) in addition to fixed fee payments for the use of land.When production starts, TPL receives revenue from oil and gas royalty interests and also revenues related to saltwater disposal. In addition, the company generates revenue from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases, and temporary permits and continues to explore new opportunities related to renewable energy, environmental sustainability, and technology, among others.TPL reports its revenues between the Land and Resource Management segment and the Water Services segment:Before 2017, TPL allowed operators to explore for water and install their own infrastructure, and while it still generating royalties from these agreements, the management recognized an opportunity by developing water fields, providing water to operators, treating and recycling the water generated during wells competition (approximately 4 barrels of water for 1 barrel of oil).The Water Services segment represented 6% of total revenues in 2015 and currently represents over 33% of revenues and 28% of net income. From 2017 until the 2Q of 2023, TPL spent $118.3MM in Capex for this segment and generated over $747MM in revenues, with a net profit margin of slightly over 50%. In 2017, TPWR hired Robert Crain, who was the former head of water development for EOG Resources.As we can see in the chart above, TPL's average production per day has been rising at 37.1% CAGR, which resulted in total revenues increasing at 36.6% CAGR from 2014. Oil prices haven't changed much since then, even with significant volatility along the way, since the  per barrel was $93.1 in 2014 and $92.9 in 2022. This exponential increase in production has been possible due to a significant  for producers.Even though revenues have been growing at a similar pace with production, there are some relevant aspects to take into account. The company has reduced its volatility thanks to TPWR. In the 31% oil price decline during 2020, Water Services revenues only declined 15%. The source of revenues has also changed significantly since TPL has reduced land sales, and easements have gone from weighting 39% of revenues in 2014 to 7% in 2022.TPL's clients are major energy companies, and in 2022, 17.3% of revenues were from Occidental Petroleum Corporation (), 14.2% from Chevron Corporation (), and 10.2% from ConocoPhillips (). The company only employed 99 full-time people in 2022, of which 29 work in Water Services, and has strong FCF margins (66.5% LTM) and ROIC of over 100%.Until 2017, TPL returned an average of over 80% of its FCF to certificate holders through repurchases and small dividends. But from 2018, the company increased the return of capital to shareholders through dividends, and while they usually represented 7% of the capital returned, in 2022, 77% of capital returned to shareholders was through dividends.The company already bought 17,802 shares for $26.2MM during the 1H 2023 and still has available $223MM under the repurchase program (1.63% of outstanding shares). Even though I like the fact that TPL found a good use for capital in the water segment, I would prefer the company to continue with share buybacks instead of dividends, since it would benefit long-term shareholders to compound at a higher rate and avoid being taxed along the way.Making predictions on the oil and gas market is always difficult because of the high amount of variables that can affect price and production, not to mention black swans. However, to value the expected growth of TPL, we will look at the available data to make some long-term assumptions.In the long term, even though renewable energies will grow at a fast pace and are going to take share from other sources, petroleum, and natural gas consumption are not expected to diminish for the next decades.Even though the  in the transportation sector will reduce during the next decades, there are  where it could be needed, like plastics, medical supplies, electronics, and even textiles, so I expect it will be a valuable commodity for a long time. In the most recent period of time, during 2022 oil prices were at their high range due to the continued oil supply cuts by OPEC+, Russia's attack on Ukraine, and strong demand. To help mitigate inflationary pressures, the United States released millions of barrels of crude oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.The U.S. government has been able to reduce temporarily oil prices, but the reserves haven't been at current levels since the mid-'80s, and they are not going to be able to continue this policy for a long period of time. In addition, Saudi Arabia  they will extend its voluntary 1 million barrel per day (b/d) production cut through the end of this year and the EIA expects Brent crude oil spot price to average $93 per barrel in 4Q 2023, and $88 per barrel in 2024.During the 2Q of 2023, the activity in the Permian Basin, where TPL operates, has remained robust, which confirms that we can expect similar or growing production levels in the near term since drilled but uncompleted wells (DUC), which in 91% of cases are completed within 12 months, have increased from 584 at the end of 2022 to the current 593.The major risk for TPL would be a decline in oil prices and a reduction in demand because of an economic recession and lower production levels. In that particular case, production would be postponed until prices make it worthwhile for operators to drill, but even if it would be negative in the short time, it would expand the years of inventory for TPL.At current levels of production, TPL has an inventory level of 14 years at a breakeven price under $40/bbl, but it more than doubles if we raise the breakeven price to $50/bbl if more drilling locations are started in the Midland Basin, where production costs are higher. This is without accounting for any new technological developments, which seems conservative to me for such a long period of time.To model TPL's fair value, in my base case scenario, I am assuming production continues at current levels in line with the EIA expectations, and price averages $88/bbl in 2024 and grows at 3% annually, in line with a  made by the EIA, Shell (), Eni (), and BP ().The water segment has been growing at a significantly faster pace than TPL's total revenues and production, and even with the decline in oil prices in the last twelve months, it has managed to grow 38% YoY (25% production growth YoY). I expect it to continue growing at least 15% annually for the next 5 years, easements to grow at 3%, and no land sales.Using a DCF model with a 10% discount rate, the average fair price between a perpetuity approach and an FCF multiple approach is $1,433.When modeling future cash flows for the next 14 years, reducing water segment growth to inflation, the sum of FCF available to shareholders would be $9.5B, with a present value of $4.7B at a 10% discount rate and we would have to add the value the company can get for its 886,000 acres of land. This assumption I believe is conservative, since TPL can continue producing after the 14th year if oil prices make it worthwhile for operators, which would increase oil and gas royalties even if production doesn't increase. TPL is also exploring new opportunities in renewables, grid-connected batteries, and studies on carbon capture.The assumption that production doesn't grow I believe is conservative, since as we highlighted before, the production in the Permian Basin has been booming over the last years and it continued growing in 2Q 2023. The land owner by TPL has one of the lowest breakeven prices in the U.S., so it would make sense if it continues at current levels or higher for the upcoming years.When valuing TPL assuming production doesn't grow in the following years and with a 25x FCF, the stock seems about 25% overvalued, but I believe this are conservative assumption given the current data available. At current prices, the market is expecting TPL's FCF to grow at 13% in the next years or a higher multiple (28x LTM FCF) that I used in my model.TPL has been trading at an average of 35x LTM FCF for the last 10 years, but I expect the valuation to decrease since production has already been growing at a slower pace since 2020 and higher long-term interest rates should push valuation lower.In my base case scenario, I consider TPL to be overvalued, and even if I consider it a high-quality business and one of the best companies to get exposure to the oil and gas market without the risk of debt and large capex, I am not willing to pay the current premium, but I believe there is value under the $1400 price per share.The major risks for TPL would be a decline in production or oil and gas prices. As we have previously explained, production is expected to remain at current levels over the long term, and given the quality of TPL's land and the fact the company is not using debt, even in a recessionary environment, it would perform better than many other oil and gas companies.From the lawsuit perspective and the pending ruling from the Delaware Court, even if it decides to rule in favor of TPL, HK and SoftVest could appeal the decision. In case it rules against TPL, I don't expect the company to appeal and continue spending shareholders' money on that matter, since two of the main precursors of this lawsuit will leave the board soon, maybe earlier than the court's decision.All in all, I believe over the long term TPL's shareholders can find value in holding such an outstanding business and gain exposure to the oil and gas market with lower volatility and risks compared to other players. As we recently saw, this is one of these business models that doesn't need to be run by outstanding management to be successful.The recent Cooperation Agreement looks like the beginning of the end for management issues and even though it took some time, TPL is going in the direction that HK, SoftVest the majority of its shareholders want, based on the votes recorded at the last AGM.Even though I recognize TPL's competitive advantage thanks to its premium land with lower extraction costs, I am not willing to pay any price. The market is pricing growing production levels or higher oil prices, which could make sense given the low levels at the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and Saudi Arabia's production cuts in place.In conclusion, I would like to have some margin of safety and find the company to be overvalued at current prices compared to my fair price of $1,433 per share, assigning it a hold rating.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,"ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc. () is a closed-end fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations, master limited partnerships, and other energy infrastructure companies. This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus, we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield. This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most income-focused investors.As regular readers will likely recall, we last discussed this fund in mid-September, although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members. The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17, 2023. That was well before energy prices started to tick up in mid-July, so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests. We can actually see this by looking at the fund's performance, which has been substantially better than the broader S&P 500 Index () since that article was published:The difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the S&P 500 Index, which provides a boost to its overall investment return. When we consider this distribution, investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 12.26% over the past five months, compared to 3.60% for investors in the S&P 500 Index. That is a pretty significant difference in results. Fortunately, there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward, although perhaps not quite that strong.There have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article. Most importantly, the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss. Therefore, let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an income-focused portfolio today.According to the fund's , the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return. This makes sense because this is a common equity fund, which is immediately apparent in the fact that 98.06% of the fund's assets are invested in common equity:As I have pointed out in numerous previous articles, common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle. After all, investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of time.In the case of midstream companies and partnerships, a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends. We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index (), which primarily tracks midstream partnerships. Here are the comparison figures for the past year:As we can see, the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 11.93%, but investors in the fund actually realized a 21.31% gain on their investment. This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments. In many years, the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this. As such, we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciation.As regular readers are no doubt well aware, I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years. These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site. As such, most readers should be familiar with the largest positions in the fund. Here they are:I have discussed all of these companies except for Western Midstream Partners () and Plains GP Holdings () over the years. However, Plains GP Holdings is simply the general partner and manager of Plains All American Pipeline (), which I have discussed quite often. As such, it should be quite familiar to most readers. Indeed, all of these companies should be reasonably familiar. That is nice because I should not have to point out that many of these are among the best companies in the industry.There is almost certainly one major change to this list that has occurred within the past few weeks, however. That is Magellan Midstream Partners, which recently completed a pending merger with ONEOK () and is no longer an independent company. As such, it is quite likely that ONEOK has probably replaced Magellan Midstream Partners since the end of August (the date that the fund last publicly updated its holdings). That is by no means certain, however, and it is possible that the fund sold off the ONEOK shares that it received in the merger in favor of something else. At the moment, we do not know exactly what the tenth company is among the fund's largest positions. This fund has an annual turnover of 60.00%, so it does a fair amount of trading, and it is certainly possible that it sold off the ONEOK shares.In a few recent articles, I have pointed out that there are signs that the American economy may be starting to slow down. For example, we are starting to see consumers beginning to get tired of their post-pandemic spending spree and cutting back. Citibank  that consumer spending on credit cards fell 11% in September, which represents the fifth consecutive monthly drop and the largest so far. When we consider that this period included the ""back to school"" season (typically a fairly large event for retail spending) was weaker than normal this year and prices have certainly not declined, this is a very clear sign that one of the last bastions of economic strength has crumbled. Fortunately, the companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are highly unlikely to be affected by economic weakness. This is due to the business model that these companies employ, which I discussed in a previous article:This business model works so well to protect these companies against economic problems that even the COVID-19 lockdowns in the Spring of 2020 had no impact on most of their cash flows. While we did see several of these companies reduce their distributions in response to that event, that was simply because the capital markets did not want to touch anything related to the oil and gas industry. These companies simply cut their distributions in order to pay off their debt and become self-financing. As I have pointed out in many previous articles though, their cash flow was almost completely unaffected. It seems likely that the same would be the case in another economic downturn, such as what might be coming. As we will see in a moment, energy prices could increase going forward, which would put further pressure on consumers.As we already saw, the cash flows of the midstream companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are not significantly impacted by energy prices. If they were, then these companies would not have handled the COVID-19 lockdowns as well as they did. However, their equity prices do still correlate with oil prices to a certain degree. It is not a perfect correlation, but we can still see one in this chart:This chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against the Alerian MLP Index in orange and the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund in blue over the past twelve months. We can see that crude oil prices are much more volatile, but for the most part increases in crude oil prices caused the price of both the fund and the index to increase and vice versa. Thus, the fundamentals of energy prices are still relevant to our discussion of this fund as an investment.Fortunately, the fundamentals of crude oil right now are very positive primarily because energy companies in aggregate have been underinvesting in productive capacity since 2015. There are several reasons for that, including various parties in the market refusing to provide energy prices, investor aversion towards fossil fuels, government incentives meant to promote renewable energy, and various other things. As a result of this underinvestment, crude oil production is not likely to be as high as it would have been had suitable amounts of capital been invested. This poses a problem because most sources right now expect that crude oil demand will not drop off nearly as rapidly as environmental activists and politicians believe. The truth is that renewable technology is nowhere near where we need it to be in order for it to work as a suitable replacement for hydrocarbons.As a result, the production of crude oil is likely to be lower than demand over the coming years. JPMorgan Chase recently predicted that the global demand for crude oil will be 1.1 million barrels above the production level by 2025 and 7.1 million barrels above the production level by 2030:The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries recently made similar statements. The organization's  stated that the energy industry needs to invest approximately $14 trillion into upstream, midstream, and downstream capacity by 2045 in order to avoid a catastrophic energy shortage. That is, to put it mildly, highly unlikely to happen considering that many politicians and activists are trying to curtail investment into productive capacity.There may be some readers who point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is simply talking up its own book with its statements about a mid-term shortage of oil. That is certainly possible, but private companies such as JPMorgan and Moody's are saying the exact same thing. Thus, it is something that we can probably take seriously.The laws of supply and demand imply that a shortage of crude oil would have the effect of raising crude oil prices. As we have already seen, there appears to be a correlation between the price performance of midstream companies, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund, and crude oil. Thus, there is reason to believe that this situation will have a positive effect on the share price of this fund over the mid-to-long term.As mentioned earlier in this article, the primary objective of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is to provide its investors with a high level of total return. In order to accomplish this, the fund invests primarily in midstream companies and partnerships. These are companies that deliver a significant percentage of their total return in the form of direct payments to the shareholders. As a result, they tend to have high yields. For example, the Alerian MLP Index yields 8.13% at the current price. The ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund collects these distributions and pays them out to its own shareholders along with any capital gains that it manages to realize. As such, we can assume that this fund would have a fairly high distribution yield itself.That is certainly the case as the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund currently pays a quarterly distribution of $0.65 per share ($2.60 per share annually), which gives it an 8.60% yield at the current price. This is a very reasonable yield for a fund like this and it is sufficiently high to appeal to any income-focused investor. Unfortunately, the fund has not been especially consistent with respect to its distribution over the years. As we can see here, it has had to make a few large cuts over its lifetime, although it has generally been boosting its distribution since 2020:The fact that the fund has not obtained a perfect track record with its distribution could be something of a turn-off to investors who are seeking a safe and consistent source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles. However, as I explained earlier in this article, several midstream companies cut their distributions in 2020 despite their cash flow remaining stable. In addition, companies in the industry saw their equity prices collapse. These two factors reduced the amount of money coming into the fund and forced it to take substantial unrealized losses. Thus, it makes sense that the fund had to cut in response to these events. Fortunately, we can see that it has been increasing its distribution now that the sector has largely recovered.Naturally, though, anyone who purchases the fund today will receive the current distribution at the current yield and will not be adversely affected by the distribution cuts that the fund was forced to impose in the past. As such, the biggest concern for investors today is how well the fund can sustain its current distribution. Let us investigate this.Fortunately, we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis. As of the time of writing, the fund's most recent  corresponds to the six-month period that ended on May 31, 2023. This is a newer report than the one that we had the last time that we discussed this fund, which is quite nice to see. After all, during the first half of this year, crude oil prices were generally much lower than they were in either 2022 or recently. This weighed somewhat on midstream stocks and likely made it much more difficult for the fund to earn capital gains than it experienced in 2022. This report will thus show us how the fund performed in such an environment, and seeing how a management team handles a challenging environment is a very important part of determining its overall skill. After all, anybody can make money in a raging bull market.During the six-month period, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund received $23,247,909 in dividends and distributions along with $178,049 from the money market funds storing its cash. The fund reported no interest during the period. One characteristic of midstream partnerships is that their distributions are not considered to be income to the fund, so the fund only had a total investment income of $4,936,584 during the period. This was not enough to cover the fund's expenses, and it ended up reporting a net investment loss of $5,316,691 over the course of six months. Obviously, that was nowhere near enough to pay any distribution, but the fund still handed out $13,682,401 to its shareholders. At first glance, this is almost certainly going to be very concerning.However, the fund does have other methods through which it can obtain the money that it needs to cover the distribution. For example, the fund received $18,787,159 in distributions from master limited partnerships during the period. That money was not considered to be income for tax purposes, but it still represents money coming into the fund. The fund also might have been able to get some capital gains that can be paid out. Unfortunately, it was not successful at this task as it only reported net realized gains of $8,290,562 but this was more than offset by $42,384,338 net unrealized losses. Overall, the fund's assets declined by $56,823,422 after accounting for all inflows and outflows during the period. Thus, it failed to cover its distributions overall, which is worrying. However, the fund's net assets were still up over the trailing eighteen-month period. In short, the fund made enough money over the course of 2022 to cover all of its distributions for that year and make up the difference for the first half of 2023. Thus, the distribution is probably reasonably safe right now, especially considering that the past few months have given it the possibility of having more gains.As of October 6, 2023 (the most recent date for which data is available as of the time of writing), the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has a net asset value of $34.97 per share but the shares only trade for $31.17 each. As such, the fund's shares are currently trading at a 10.87% discount on net asset value. This is a very large discount, although it is nowhere near as attractive as the 12.91% discount that the shares have had on average over the past month. As such, it might be possible to obtain a better price by waiting a bit. However, realistically a double-digit discount is generally a reasonable price to pay for any fund, so the current price is probably acceptable if you want to own some shares.In conclusion, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is a reasonable way to play the midstream exposure without having to worry about the tax problems that can come along with owning master limited partnerships. This fund is structured as a corporation, so it handles all the tax issues on the fund level. The fund has delivered a respectable performance over the past several months, as it has beaten the S&P 500 Index, and it seems likely that it will continue to do so due to the strong mid-term fundamentals for energy. The valuation is also reasonable right now. The biggest problem here is that the fund failed to cover its distribution during the first half of the year, but due to the very strong performance that it delivered in 2022, it is not straining to maintain the distribution. Overall, this fund might be worth considering for a portfolio today.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Vital Farms: This Stock Is Cooking (Rating Upgrade),"Almost exactly 11 months ago, I found myself analyzing a rather interesting company in the food space. Generally speaking, I don't like to play much in this market because it is highly competitive and margins can beWhile this may not seem like a strong growth area, the company has achievedRecent financial performance achieved by Vital Farms has been truly impressive. Take revenue during the . During that time, revenue totaled $225.6 million. That's 41.1% higher than the $159.9 million the company generated the same time one year earlier. Higher volume contributed $25.2 million to the company’s growth during that time, with both new and existing customers proving to be beneficial for the company. It is worth noting, however, that most of the growth, about $40.5 million, can be attributed to .If this seems outrageous, keep in mind that, as shown in the chart above, the US did experience a rather significant surge in the price of eggs, with those prices peaking earlier this year. Weak production levels were driven by not only supply chain issues, but also, more importantly, the avian flu. In January of 2019, for instance, there were an  341.8 million egg laying hens across the nation. That number declined over the next three years and, by January of 2022, the size of the flock had dropped to 326 million. It is interesting to note that a shift in consumer focus toward promoting cage free hens over caged ones did result in an increase in the number of cage free layers during this window of time.While revenue for the company increased nicely, profits followed suit. The firm went from generating a net loss of $1.3 million in the first half of 2022 to generating a net profit of $13.8 million the same time of 2023. Other profitability metrics increased as well. Operating cash flow, for instance, went from negative $3 million to $18.9 million. Adjusted operating cash flow, which adjusts for changes in working capital, jumped from $3.1 million to $25 million. And finally, EBITDA for the company expanded from $4.2 million to $25.2 million.For the current fiscal year, management is quite optimistic. This may seem peculiar to some given that egg prices have fallen significantly since peaking. Driven by higher volume that management chalked up to continued investments in its physical footprint, the firm came out with guidance when it reported second quarter results indicating that revenue this year should be in excess of $465 million. That's significantly above the $362.1 million generated in 2022. Meanwhile, EBITDA for the company should be greater than $35 million. That's more than double the $16.2 million generated one year earlier. A rough estimate from that would indicate adjusted operating cash flow for the year of roughly $34.8 million.Given these figures, I was able to value the company as shown in the chart above. On a forward basis, the firm is trading at a price to adjusted operating cash flow multiple of 13. This is down nicely from the 28.1 reading that we get using data from 2022. Over the same window of time, the EV to EBITDA multiple looks to be dropping from 22.6 to 10.5. This takes the company from very expensive to very affordable very quickly.I can understand why some investors might be hesitant. This is especially true after seeing egg prices drop like they have. But management’s not banking on egg prices remaining elevated. Rather, they are putting all of their eggs in the growth basket. You see, by the end of 2027, the company  to be generating annualized revenue in excess of $1 billion. That's approximately triple what was generated last year. A lot of this growth will come from the company’s existing Egg Central Station. At full capacity, it's capable of producing 6 million eggs per day which should, based on management's estimates, result in over $700 million of net revenue each year. Other investments will make up the rest of that gap. And because the company has virtually no debt and it enjoys cash and cash equivalents in excess of debt that totals $85.7 million, it has the kind of balance sheet needed for expansion.Of course, it would take more than increasing its physical footprint in order to achieve attractive growth. Part of the company's strategy is to work with a network of farmers so as to source directly from them. Back in 2015, the company had only 50 farms in its network. So far this year, that number has grown to more than 300. There also appears to be significant potential within this market.As of this year, the company sells its premium eggs in approximately 24,000 different stores. But the company sees an opportunity to expand this in the coming years to 32,000. This should help the company continue to get its eggs in more and more households. Back in 2015, the company estimated that its eggs only made it to approximately 0.8 million households. In 2022, this number stood at an impressive 10.5 million. However, the company believes that of the 131 million households in the US, 72 million are already buying premium eggs.It's also important to note that while there has been some weakness in terms of both the overall sales of eggs and the per capita  of eggs over the past few years, the latter metric indicates that consumption is still significantly above historical averages. And with the population of this country continuing to grow, with a target of 450 million people by 2100, it is almost certain that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Even if the company can only get to its $1 billion market size, the upside for investors from this point can be significant.The company has forecasted that its EBITDA margin at that point will be between 12% and 14%. At the midpoint, that would translate to EBITDA of $130 million. Compared to how shares are trading today, that would result in an EV to EBITDA multiple of 2.8. If we assume that the fair value EV to EBITDA multiple for a company at that point would be 8, then by 2028 the firm would be worth over $1 billion, translating to annualized upside for shareholders of almost 30%.Diligent investors would be wise to keep in mind that conditions can change period and sometimes, those changes can be rapid. Because of this, it would be wise to pay attention to when management reports financial results for the third quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. This is expected to be November 2nd. At present, analysts are forecasting revenue of $110.2 million. This represents a decent increase over the $92 million generated one year earlier. While this does seem to indicate a possible deceleration of growth, much of that would likely be driven by the decline in egg prices that I have mentioned. But profits are still expected to rise nicely to $0.05 per share. That's more than double the $0.02 per share generated in the third quarter of 2022. It would also represent an increase in earnings from only $0.7 million to $2.2 million. There are other profitability metrics that investors should pay attention to. Operating cash flow is one. In the third quarter of last year, the company reported negative $0.4 million for that. On an adjusted basis, it was considerably better at $6.2 million, while EBITDA came in at $5.2 million.Based on the data provided, I must say that I have had a big change of heart when it comes to Vital Farms. Growth has been very impressive as of late and, while shares of the company were expensive, they have gotten a lot cheaper. I understand that growth plans are never guaranteed and there is always some risk banking on those. But when you consider how shares are already priced today, I do believe that the upside potential is great enough to warrant a ‘buy’ rating. is an exclusive community of investors who have a taste for oil and natural gas firms.

Lockheed Martin Remains A Buy Amidst Global Tension,"Following the devastating attacks in Israel, defense stocks surged, and Lockheed Martin () was no exception. With event-driven surges like these, there are two ways things could be heading. The first path is that the surge fades and the second one isGenerally, I do expect the  laid out previously to remain intact for the simple reason that little has changed since, other than the stock losing value and Lockheed Martin increased its dividend which seemingly makes the investment case for the stock even more compelling.The tragic events in Israel do show one thing and that's conflict in the world has notThe evoX Defense Monitor shows that in 2024, global defense budgets are expected to increase to $2.6 trillion, a staggering amount driven by global conflict. The expanding defense budgets support spending in several areas, namely modernization, expansion of capacity, expansion of existing capability and new weapon system capabilities. Generally, conflict spurs the prospects for defense contractors, but it's the defense solutions portfolio that determines which defense contractors will benefit more than others. I view Lockheed Martin as one of the companies that is positioned well in the defense landscape.For the third quarter, analysts expect revenues between $16.08 billion and $16.97 billion with a consensus estimate of $16.69 billion indicating 0.62% growth and EPS of $6.64-$6.82 with a consensus estimate of $6.62 indicating a 3.7% drop. If you would solely look at the positive backdrop for defense companies, the projections are somewhat underwhelming. However, it should be noted that prior to the escalation in Ukraine, Lockheed Martin was seeing some pressure as certain programs would ramp down offsetting ramp-ups on other programs resulting in lower growth or even flattish sales in 2023 and 2024. These years have been marked as transition years and defense companies are as agile as an oil tanker, it is hard to turn it but once it is moving it is hard to stop it.Despite escalating conflicts, those transition years are not magically going to turn into high growth as defense contracting and procurement are almost as agile. The defense industry is driven by the mid- to longer-term trends. So, 2023 and 2024 are not going to be huge is the expectation due to the ramp-up nature and the relatively long time for customer interest translating to backlog and subsequently to revenues. The war in Ukraine did accelerate translation to backlog somewhat, but ramping up programs is still another story. Furthermore, the F-35 program has been coping with some setbacks in terms of its ability to deliver the advanced jet as well as the production rate unlikely to be hitting the sustained higher production levels that were initially anticipated. The positive is that 2024 is now the point at which Lockheed Martin does expect a return to growth, so there is some positive compression in the timeline.Lockheed Martin will be reporting its Q3 2023 financial results and 2023 guidance on the 17th of October before the opening bell followed by an earnings call at 11 AM EST.Lockheed Martin recently announced an increase of its quarterly dividend to $3.15 per share, providing a 5% increase with a 2.9% forward yield. It's not a juicy yield, but the prospects of share price appreciation and dividend increases provide a nice yield overall.I previously  out that the dividend increases were falling behind of the CAGR of 13% and that has been the case for several years now. The 5% increase results in annual dividend increasing 6.6% which is lower than the long-term CAGR as well as the CAGR measured from a certain year to 2023. So, the dividend hike is losing steam in some sense, but it should also be pointed out that maintaining a high CAGR is challenging.The positive for shareholders is that the company authorized the purchase of up to an additional $6 billion, nearly doubling the total authorization of the current program to $13B for future purchases. While not everyone is a fan of share repurchases and prefers dividends, the share repurchases provide some additional yield when timed well and also play an important role in keeping a dividend growth record.Previously I put a $553 stock price target based on valuing Lockheed Martin in line with the industry median. My near-term price target now is $483 per share up from $464 given that Lockheed Martin tends to trade forward at 2025 earnings. Based on the industry median the longer-term target for now is $569 per share. The changes in estimates are driven by better free cash flow performance, slightly better results, higher share repurchases this year and lower debt accumulation than initially anticipated. As a result, I continue to maintain my buy rating for the stock.Lockheed Martin is facing pressure on the long-term production rate of the F-35, but we also see that in the current geopolitical landscape, there is upward pressure on defense spending and the F-35 is gaining traction in Europe. We're also seeing that Lockheed Martin seems to be returning to growth a year earlier than initially expected. So, while there's some program ramp friction, we do see upside for the stock. Additional upside in the years after will be driven by an ability to convert backlog to sales. So, I do expect that while the market currently still cheers on high order intake, at some point the focus will shift toward the ability to actually convert the backlog at a fast but sustainable rate.If you want full access to all our reports, data and investing ideas, for the #1 aerospace, defense and airline investment research service on Seeking Alpha, with access to evoX Data Analytics, our in-house developed data analytics platform. Dhierin-Perkash Bechai is an aerospace, defense and airline analyst.

IXC: Right Sector But Global Allocation Is Challenged,"Energy and persistence conquer all things. - Benjamin FranklinInvesting in the energy sector can be a lucrative long-term strategy, especially since the underlying dynamics for oil in terms of supply are conducive towards outperformance for stocks in the space. TheIXC is designed to track the performance of the S&P Global 1200 Energy Index, which includes companies involved in the production and distribution of oil and gas. With 52 holdings, IXC provides investors with exposure to major energy companies from around the world.The top holdings of IXC includeIt's worth noting that this is still primarily a US fund (and that many US energy companies clearly have global operations anyway. Over 60% is US-based, with around 12% in the UK and 11% in Canada.Over the past five years, IXC has delivered decent returns, much of which is attributable to the post-Covid rally. Relative to the S&P 500 (), it still lags over the last 5 years, but momentum is clearly there in terms of overall strength.When we compare IXC to the energy ETF behemoth XLE, we can see that a global allocation to energy has been underwhelming. It has been far better to invest in Energy through the US than to dilute with anything outside our borders.While short-term market conditions may fluctuate, the long-term outlook for the energy sector remains promising. On the demand side, global economic growth and the increasing need for energy resources continue to drive demand for oil and gas. Despite the rise of renewable energy sources, oil and gas remain crucial in meeting global energy demands.Supply-side dynamics also play a significant role in the long-term outlook for the energy sector. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major oil-producing nations have a significant influence on global oil supply. By carefully managing production levels, these organizations can impact oil prices and create opportunities for investors.While the energy sector as a whole offers long-term growth potential, US energy stocks may present a better investment opportunity. The US energy market benefits from technological advancements, regulatory stability, and a diverse range of energy sources.The shale revolution in the United States has led to a surge in domestic energy production, making the country a leading player in the global energy market. As technology continues to advance, US energy companies are becoming more efficient and cost-effective in extracting and producing energy resources.Furthermore, the US energy market has weathered various market cycles and demonstrated resilience in the face of uncertainty. There is far more uncertainty when it comes to energy companies internationally by comparison.Investing in the iShares Global Energy ETF () can be a strategic move for investors seeking exposure to the energy sector. With its diversified holdings and global reach, IXC provides a comprehensive approach to investing in the energy industry. It's a good fund, but it's clear that for now the best way to access energy is by being in the US rather than by diversifying sector exposure globally. This could change, of course, but for now I'd rather consider more domestic exposure.Markets aren’t as efficient as conventional wisdom would have you believe.

Why I Believe That Newmont Could Triple,"It's time to talk about , the world's second-largest gold mining corporation.Over the past three years, shares have fallen 40% (excluding dividends), underperforming the VanEck Gold Miners ETF () by roughly 10 points. Gold prices areMore recently, gold miners have been hurt by falling gold prices, sticky inflation, and related mining risks.While we're likely stuck in a period of sticky inflation, the single biggest bull case is further deteriorating economic growth, which could force the Fed to cut rates. Once that happens, I expect a very steep increase in NEM's stock price.Now, let's dive into the details!Newmont is a giant. In the second quarter, the companyThis translated to nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $650 million in cash from continuing operations.Furthermore, the company has an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Solid margins were sustained due to higher realized gold prices and consistent direct costs.Despite these achievements, the company had to acknowledge challenges during the quarter and make four pivotal decisions.Having said that, and with regard to the map above, while the company saw challenges, I like NEM's assets, as it's one of the best mines with limited geopolitical risks. Most of its gold is produced in Tier 1 mines, with major production in low-risk jurisdictions.The company's dominant position is also a result of the major A$28.8 takeover of Australian Newcrest Mining.It also comes with other major benefits in light of the energy transition.According to  (emphasis added):Furthermore, with regard to some of the challenges I mentioned in the introduction:Based on this context, Newmont believes it can ramp up production in the second half of 2023, primarily driven by increased grades and tonnes mined across various locations, including Subika underground and Ahafo open pit.The Cerro Negro's expansion and Tanami's higher-grade ore also contribute to the positive outlook.So, despite challenges, Newmont remains on track to meet its annual production guidance with the support of non-managed joint ventures Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo.Looking at its five-year outlook, the company is looking to boost production to the range of 6.1 to 6.7 million ounces per year, lowering all-in-sustaining costs to no more than $1,100.With that in mind, NEM is also a source of income for many investors.In the second quarter, Newmont declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share annually, consistent with the previous two quarters.This dividend translates to a 4.1% yield.According to the company, the dividend falls within the 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share.While its dividend isn't very consistent, Newmont has maintained a dividend yield exceeding 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, maintaining its position with the highest dividend per share in the gold sector.There's also a lot of upside for the dividend if gold prices soar. Looking at the data below, we see that the company increases its free cash flow (operating cash flow after investments in its business) by $400 million for every $100 increase in the price of gold (per troy ounce).Looking at the overview below, we see the aforementioned $1.40 to $1.80 dividend range again.In this case, the company has a $1.00 base dividend, backed by a gold price of $1,400.The company adjusts its dividend based on $300 changes in the gold price. So, based on current gold prices (roughly $1,900), the dividend range is $1.40 to $1.80.That number is likely to rise significantly to the $2.00 to $3.00 range if gold rises $100 - and remains elevated.Based on this context, I believe that NEM could see a scenario of much higher gold prices.I have a bullish view on gold prices for one major reason: the Federal Reserve.While I've been contrarian in my belief that both rates and inflation will remain elevated/sticky on a prolonged basis, we're now at a point where economic growth might become so poor that the Fed may be forced to cut at some point.While housing and employment indicators are still holding up nicely, leading indicators like the ISM Manufacturing/Services Indices are pointing at significant weakness down the road.At this point, it's important to note that one major driver of gold prices is future rate expectations. The chart below compares the gold price (black line) to the difference between March 2025 SOFR futures and one-month forward SOFR futures.Essentially, SOFR is the replacement of LIBOR. It's a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement (""repo"") market.If the line increases, it means that investors expect borrowing costs in the future to decline relative to the short-term outlook.This hints at easing financial conditions, which is bullish for gold.Gold took off shortly after this line accelerated last year. It's also falling in tandem with the spread this year.Hence, if economic growth reaches a point where the market prices in more aggressive rate cuts, gold is the place to be - according to this theory.In such a scenario, I expect gold prices to rise beyond $3,000 per troy ounce, which would be great for NEM and its dividend.On top of that, NEM is currently in the worst period of underperformance versus its peers in more than a decade, which is fueled by M&A uncertainty.I believe this offers opportunities - on top of my bullish view.NEM shares are currently trading at $39. The consensus price target is $55. I believe that NEM is a $120 stock if my thesis turns out to be correct. If gold rises to $3,000, the company could get an additional $6-$7 billion in incremental free cash flow. That would warrant this valuation, as it would indicate a high-double-digit free cash flow yield close to 20%.However, that's a longer-term outlook, which could take 2-3 years to unfold.Even if I'm less bullish, I believe that NEM shares are significantly undervalued at current prices.Despite recent challenges and underperformance, Newmont's robust assets and strategic acquisitions position it for a promising future.A blend of consistent margins, prudent decisions, and solid production levels form a solid foundation.The potential for an economic downturn leading to rate cuts could prove to be the much-awaited trigger for NEM's stock surge.Amidst the complexities of gold prices and inflation, NEM also offers a promising income source with dividends and growth potential.Given the bigger picture, I believe NEM offers a tremendous long-term risk/reward, which could lead to very high gains over the next 2-3 years.I'm looking to add NEM to my trading portfolio soon.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Ring Energy: Recent Transactions Reduce Its Operating Costs,"Ring Energy's () recent transactions appear to be positive for the company. It divested some very high-cost Delaware Basin production (with lease operating expenses of nearly $45 per BOE in 2022), while acquiring Central Basin Platform assets These transactions boost Ring's estimated value slightly compared to  and I now believe Ring is worth approximately $1.95 per share at long-term $70 WTI oil and $2.85 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil.Ring's interest costs are significant though, and are approaching $6 per BOE at current interest rates.Ring acquired Central Basin Platform assets from Founders Oil & Gas IV for a purchase price that was initially . After purchase price adjustments, RingRing mentioned that the acquired assets had Q2 2023 production of 2,500 BOEPD (86% oil). Ring appears to be letting production decline fairly quickly in the near-term as Q4 2023 sales volumes from the assets may be close to 1,700 BOEPD, based on calculations around Ring's 2H 2023 guidance.At that lowered production level, the assets should still be able to generate $30+ million per year in annualized EBITDA (at high-$70s WTI oil) though, so the net $65 million purchase price appears to be pretty good.Ring also  for $7.8 million in net proceeds after purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. These assets were producing 240 BOEPD (85% oil). I view this sale price as being favorable too, due to the high operating expenses for Ring's Delaware Basin assets. Ring reported lease operating expenses of $44.86 per BOE in 2022. At high-$70s WTI oil and 240 BOEPD, the Delaware Basin assets would only produce $1.4 million EBITDA per year.After strong sales volumes in Q1 2023, Ring's sales volumes ended up falling below expectations . It expected to average 17,900 to 18,400 BOEPD in Q2 2023 and only sold an average of 17,271 BOEPD during the quarter.This was partially due to its Delaware Basin divestiture, which closed in May 2023. However, even with a full quarter's contribution from those assets, Ring's sales volumes would have been only slightly over 17,400 BOEPD.I had previously highlighted Ring's low realized prices for its non-oil production. This became particularly apparent in Q2 2023 with benchmark natural gas prices falling to the low $2 range.Ring realized negative $0.71 per Mcf for its natural gas in Q2 2023, with its gathering, transportation and processing costs exceeding regional natural gas prices. Ring's differential for natural gas was negative $3.07 per Mcf during the quarter.Ring realized $10.35 per barrel for its NGLs, so it ended up generating a total of $1.3 million in revenues from its roughly 490,000 BOE in non-oil production during Q2 2023.From a realized pricing and sales volume perspective, Ring's Q2 2023 results weren't very good, but it did do well from a cost perspective. Its lease operating expenses ended up at $10.14 per BOE in Q2 2023, well below its guidance for $11.00 to $11.40 per BOE. Ring's mid-quarter Delaware Basin divestiture helped lower lease operating expenses, but even without that benefit it would have been well below its guidance for the quarter.Ring also noted that it deferred some well drilling and workover projects due to weakening commodity prices and plans to divert resources towards Founders acquisition. Ring's capital expenditures for Q2 2023 ended up at $31.6 million, lower than its guidance range for $34 million to $38 million in capex.After its transactions, Ring expects to average sales volumes of approximately 18,775 BOEPD (68% to 69% oil) during 2H 2023, with Q4 2023 sales volumes around 5% higher than Q3 2023 sales volumes due to the closing of the Founders deal midway through Q3.At high-$70s WTI strip for 2H 2023, I estimate that Ring can generate $181 million in revenues inclusive of hedges.This leads to a projection of $29 million in free cash flow for Ring in the second half of the year. Ring's interest costs are becoming fairly significant and are approaching $6 per BOE on an annualized basis.I now believe that Ring is worth around $1.95 per share at long-term $70 WTI oil and $2.85 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil. Ring's recent transactions were favorable on the whole, and divesting its Delaware Basin assets helps to lower its overall lease operating costs per BOE despite the small amount of production involved.While Ring has upside at long-term $75 WTI oil (which is the price I am currently modeling), it is also fairly risky due to its significant debt (and associated interest costs).Ring's recent transactions were positive for it overall and I now estimate its value at $2.85 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil, while it is fairly priced for long-term $70 WTI oil.The transactions do add to Ring's net debt (and interest costs though) after it made some progress reducing its debt during the first half of 2023. Ring may end up paying around $20 million in cash interest during the second half of 2023.Ring's debt is manageable in a $70s oil environment, but it is vulnerable to a significant drop in oil prices, such as to around $60 or below oil.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Kinder Morgan Looks More Interesting As Consolidation Occurs,"M&A activity is heating up in the energy infrastructure space. ONEOK ()  that it would acquire Magellan Midstream Partners () in a deal valued at $18.8 billion on 5/14/23. On 9/21,  of OKEAfter each new acquisition or merger takes place, KMI looks more interesting to me. KMI has one of the largest footprints in the energy infrastructure space, making them extremely attractive. The moat surrounding the incumbents is wide and deep. Unlike technology or other industries, people don't just decide they want to raise money and build pipelines. Taking a step back, you need to complete a stringent permitting process, conduct environmental studies, purchase land, get regulatory approvals, deal with regulations and ordinances throughout different areas, navigate a changing political and activist environment, and conduct ongoing maintenance to mitigate environmental damage to name a few challenges. There is a reason that in 2020,  () purchased Dominion's natural gas transmission and storage assets for $9.7 billion. It's easier to purchase existing assets than deal with all the red tape of building new infrastructure, and Berkshire already moved 8% of the United States interstate natural gas. If a company such as Berkshire that has the capital and political resources felt it was better to acquire than build, there is a reason why consolidation continues to occur in the space.Traditional Energy has lost its appeal to many because it is highly politicized, but the fact remains that without fossil fuels are a requirement for everyday life in 2023.  is responsible for transporting 40% of the natural gas that gets consumed in the United States through its 70,000 miles and 700 billion cubic feet of storage pertaining to natural gas. KMI also operates 9,500 miles of products pipelines and transports 2.4 million bpd, and 1,500 miles of CO2 pipeline. It would be next to impossible to recreate KMI's infrastructure from scratch due to land requirements alone. Every time a merger or acquisition occurs, I think about adding to my position in KMI because it has a tremendous amount of hard assets that are critical to both the domestic and international economies. Energy infrastructure companies see value in hard assets as they are willing to pay a premium to expand their footprint and benefit from combined synergies. There are many entities that operate in the natural gas space, and KMI has one of the largest pipeline networks in the country. As consolidation continues to occur, there will be fewer options for companies to target, which should increase the premium on pipeline and storage assets.No matter the political narrative, the 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA () indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids, and natural gas will increase through 2050. I am pro-renewables and have several investments in the sector, but the projections coming out of the EIA are that dry natural gas production will continue to increase throughout the United States through 2050 while the United States increases the amount of LNG it exports. The combination of increased production and exporting will have to correlate to more natural gas being transported. Kinder Morgan is a direct beneficiary of this scenario because it already moves 40% of the natural gas produced. If one of the larger companies wants to increase its footprint in the natural gas transportation space, at some point, all roads lead to KMI. Even if KMI doesn't get acquired, it's infrastructure of hard assets that will see higher utilization should see their value increase as they generate larger amounts of revenue and profits in the future.Some didn't believe KMI's management when they came out and delivered their plan for financial discipline. After roughly 8 years, KMI continues to deliver strong results.  finished 2015 with $43.3 billion in total debt and generated $6.91 billion in EBITDA. This placed their total debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 6.27x. I don't use net debt because the cash a company has on the balance sheet may not get allocated toward their debt repayments, so I use total debt. Since amassing a total debt load of $43.3 billion in 2015, KMI has eliminated $11.53 billion in total debt for a reduction of -26.62%. This has ultimately resulted in KMI's total debt-to-EBITDA ratio declining from 6.27x to 4.96x. This is the first time in 8 years that KMI has seen its total debt to EBITDA ratio fall under 5x.While improving its financial situation, KMI has also provided shareholders with 6 dividend increases since 2018. KMI had drastically reduced the quarterly dividend in 2016 from $0.51 to $0.125. The combination of KMI's increasing debt and the blow to the dividend left shareholders questioning leadership. I think investors seem to either forget or dismiss that management and the board of directors own , and their interests are aligned with common shareholders. Every decision that management makes impacts them financially, and while the improvement isn't seen in the share price today, it's hard to argue with what KMI has accomplished. While reducing the debt load by -$11.53 billion, KMI has also increased the quarterly dividend by 126% from $0.125 to $0.2825. The share price may not be as high, and the dividend may not be as large as it once was, but KMI is a stronger company today, and there is significant room for the dividend to continue increasing and for the market to reward KMI's accomplishments.In the last earnings report, KMI disclosed that they see their net income coming in at $2.5 billion, while the annualized dividends paid will represent a 2% YoY increase to $1.13 per share. I am a bit harsher than many energy infrastructure companies as they measure their leverage level by net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, whereas I look at Total Debt to EBITDA. Based on KMI's standard, they are projecting they will finish 2023 generating $7.7 billion in Adjusted EBITDA, placing their net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4x. This is below their 4.5x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA target. KMI is also projecting that it will generate $4.8 billion in distributable cash flow () which works out to $2.13 per share. KMI is paying out 53.05% of its DCF through dividends, which leaves them roughly $2.25 billion in retained DCF for business operations.KMI is in a strong position as they have $3.7 committed to a backlog of projects that will provide a runway for growth. This can all be self-funded through their retained DCF after paying the dividend. There is 37% of the backlog coming online in 2023, with another 32% in 2024. Since KMI is generating over $2 billion in retained DCF they can organically grow their operations without adding debt in a high interest rate environment. This is a combination that can help increase the amount of EBITDA, and DCF KMI generates while allowing them to pay down debt and raise the dividend.I think KMI is in a strong position considering what they have accomplished on their balance sheet and the consolidation taking place around them. KMI continues to deliver on its fiscal responsibility promise as they reduce debt, organically grows through retained DCF, and rebuild the dividend. The market isn't rewarding KMI just yet, but each year that passes puts KMI in a stronger position. I think the market will eventually turn, and we will see shares exceed $20 as the reality of the oil and gas industry continues to set in.  Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor or professional.

Petrobras: A Return To Bearish Ground As History Comes Full Circle,"Over the past few months, I have been one of the few Seeking Alpha analysts who have  a bearish outlook on Petrobras () () due to various sources of political risks. However, this pessimism hasMy initial pessimistic stance was primarily rooted in concerns about shareholder control and the potential impact of government decisions on Petrobras, especially given the company's historical context. Legislative changes, such as the injunction that reduced government control over state-owned companies, could have substantial implications. It's worth noting that Petrobras' current CEO is a former politician from the same party as Brazil's current president, Lula.One of the fundamental questions for theIn light of these factors, my outlook remains cautiously pessimistic. It's crucial to closely monitor future developments and their potential impacts on Petrobras and the broader oil industry. Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of this scenario, and observing how the situation unfolds in the coming years will be intriguing. Brazil's history with past left-wing governments, especially during Dilma Rousseff's administration, has led to long-term value erosion for Petrobras.While it's still too early to make definitive predictions, I believe it's highly improbable that the company will thrive under a management that repeats the same mistakes as those made in the past, which clearly had a detrimental impact on its value.The significance of oil to the Brazilian economy is a topic that deserves careful consideration, in my opinion. The true nature of this resource is often misconstrued. Oil has served as the primary energy source throughout the past century and continues to hold that position. Despite the growing shift towards renewable energy sources, oil remains indispensable and is unlikely to become obsolete shortly.However, owing to Petrobras being a state-owned company, there exists a misconception that the oil it extracts exclusively belongs to ""the state."" This misconception stems from a historical slogan in Brazil. Such beliefs lead people to expect low gasoline prices, complicating Petrobras' management and government decision-making. Society must grasp that while oil is indeed a valuable resource, it is not the sole property of Brazil, and international factors influence its price.Oil and natural gas constitute the primary sources of revenue for the National Treasury, and this trend is expected to continue for many years. Oil plays an integral role in Brazil's trade balance, and its production is rising. In 2022, $42.6 billion of crude oil was shipped,  13% of total Brazilian exports, a share only one percentage point behind soybeans. Exploring new areas like the Equatorial Basin is imperative to maintain high production levels. Oil is critical in the economies of various nations globally, including Russia, where it remains vital even during conflict.The Brazilian government often fails to comprehend the economic significance of oil and tends to focus primarily on fuel price-related issues. People need to recognize that oil is both lucrative and pivotal to the economy, and they must understand its relevance in the context of the global economy.Petrobras has delivered positive results thanks to effective management in recent years, particularly during the presidencies of Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro. This has proven advantageous not only for Petrobras' shareholders but also for the Brazilian economy.The current government, led by President Lula, experienced some luck concerning the price of the oil barrel. From January until July, the price fell to approximately $70 to $73 per barrel, enabling Petrobras to lower gasoline and diesel prices. However, starting in July, prices increased again, surpassing $90.Fortunately, once again, the exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar declined, offsetting one factor against the other. Petrobras still operates with some delays in price adjustments, but these favorable factors have contributed to its stock performance.Now, shifting to the diesel issue, the Russian war has significantly impacted the diesel market due to sanctions imposed on Russia. These sanctions have led Russia to sell diesel at a much lower price than domestic diesel. Approximately 80% of Brazil's diesel imports come from Russia, which has been beneficial. However, I have concerns about Petrobras' future.There was a period when Petrobras encountered significant difficulties, particularly during the transition of government leadership from President Dilma's departure to President Temer's assumption of office in 2016. The company faced a challenging situation, even holding the world's highest debtor title. Additionally, Petrobras faced at the time complications due to an unfavorable exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar, which stood at R$4.Petrobras' recovery from 2016 has relied on implementing a development plan, cost reduction, and capital management. However, these measures appear to have been neglected recently, which raises concerns for me. I am concerned about the possibility of Petrobras  in unprofitable refineries or oil fields. Additionally, there are questions surrounding Petrobras' pricing policy. The company discontinued its Import Parity Prices policy (IPP) in May and introduced a new pricing policy that is not entirely clear.As Brent crude oil prices have been climbing since July, Petrobras reached a nearly 30%  on fuels under the new pricing policy, which recently compelled the company to raise fuel prices in the country. However, the discount persists, with Brent crude oil continuing its upward trend.By the end of September, the  set at Petrobras refineries currently show a 13.6% discount on diesel and a 2.3% premium on gasoline compared to the international market price parity. This marks a change from the previous week when diesel and petrol had discounts of 13.6% and 5.5%, respectively, compared to international prices.The premium on gasoline is due to Petrobras' price increase, which coincided with decreases in prices at international fuel hubs. This increase was partially offset by strengthening the U.S. dollar during the week, which rose 1.4%. Diesel prices remained relatively stable over the week.Petrobras needs a clear investment plan, but it seems this is currently on hold under the new management.Petrobras has  a possible investment in offshore wind energy. Firstly, Brazil lacks regulations for offshore wind energy investments. This means that the company is subject to congressional approval, which can be uncertain due to the lack of a clear government majority. In addition, over the last 20 years, Petrobras has accumulated a series of destructive projects, such as Pasadena, Abreu e Lima, and others, resulting in significant losses.In my analysis, Petrobras should focus on its core activities, such as deepwater oil production, rather than venturing into new projects. Resources are scarce, and investing in offshore wind energy may not be the smartest choice. Another point to consider is the energy transition. Brazil already has a clean energy matrix, emphasizing hydroelectric power. Investing in offshore wind energy may not be necessary since the country has already made its energy transition.The idea of exporting energy is also questionable, as it would require investments in transmission infrastructure to export energy to Europe and the US, which is not feasible now.  show that offshore energy production is one of the most expensive and least efficient. Therefore, investing in something that spends a lot and produces little doesn't seem wise. Also, many concerns exist, from the lack of regulation to allocating scarce resources.Parallel to this, Petrobras recently reported that its board of directors had approved a new , reducing the free cash flow distributed to shareholders from 60% to 45%.The company's investment cash flow for the upcoming years is still uncertain. Petrobras has not yet released its investment plan, which is expected to be disclosed along with the strategic plan 2024 and beyond in the coming months.Over the last five years, Petrobras achieved an average operating cash generation of approximately R$ 160 billion annually, while the average cash flow from investments was R$ 40 billion. Half this amount was allocated to maintaining operations, while the other half went to growth and new business lines (approximately R$ 20 billion each).I believe it's crucial not to attempt to predict the future with absolute certainty but rather to engage in analysis. We are witnessing higher oil prices in the second half of the year, although they are not as high as they could be, primarily due to factors like China's slower growth. Oil plays a pivotal role in the economy, as energy catalyzes economic growth. Completely forsaking fossil fuels, especially when oil consumption is expected to rise in the coming years, and supply remains limited, is not a viable option.Moreover, there are two major players in oil production, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia. Brazil needs to expedite its oil production to capitalize on the growing demand and avoid overreliance on these major players. However, it's essential to acknowledge the environmental discourse. Countries like the UK are  legislation to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, Brazil should not follow a contradictory path by importing liquefied natural gas from the United States while financing a gas pipeline from Argentina instead of developing its production.Carbon capture technology is advancing and could contribute to mitigating the environmental impact of fossil fuel production. The challenge lies in finding ways to use fossil fuels more cleanly while simultaneously promoting the utilization of renewable energies. Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly accessible and efficient, but it's essential to recognize that oil will remain a significant energy source in the foreseeable future.While OPEC  a strong demand for oil in 2024, traders have  their concerns from under-supply to potential oversupply due to the structure of the global benchmark Brent futures contracts. This shift comes as expectations of weak economic growth outweigh Saudi Arabia's output cuts.As a result, I believe it is unlikely that oil will experience a sharp drop to very low prices, such as $30 or $40, in the coming years. Oil will continue to play a significant role in the global energy landscape.Petrobras continues to trade at exceptionally low valuation multiples compared to other global and domestic private oil companies, with a P/E ratio 4x versus the sector average of 10x. However, it's essential to clarify that this 60% discount is primarily due to the significant political risk associated with the company.Furthermore, when considering the forward EV/EBITDA, Petrobras trades at a premium compared to Norwegian state-owned Equinor ASA (), and political risks influence both companies' valuations.Political risk cannot be quantified as it hinges on government decisions that can swiftly and dramatically impact the company's stock, eroding investor confidence. Petrobras has  its CEO 17 times in the last 30 years, starkly contrasting privately-owned oil companies.At current price levels, Petrobras is trading at 2.8x forward 2024 EV/EBITDA, with a 20% cash flow yield for 2024. These levels may appear attractive but do not account for the risks associated with potentially harmful investments or unwise acquisitions. Additionally, there is pressure on refining margins compared to well-managed private peers with successful track records.Furthermore, recent measures, such as curtailing international parity and reinitiating investments in non-core initiatives, have raised additional concerns. Frequent changes in shareholders and presidents, often driven by political pressure and fuel price concerns, should not affect Petrobras' management.Satisfying Petrobras' shareholders also equates to serving the broader society, as all Brazilians are indirect stakeholders in the company. Petrobras generates dividends, which the government can allocate to investments in critical areas like education, healthcare, or national debt reduction.However, the generous dividends distributed last year are expected to diminish. The forecast for 2024 and beyond is regressive due to the implementation of the new dividend policy and potential challenges stemming from price gaps and investments in non-core businesses.It's crucial to acknowledge that Petrobras is profoundly influenced by the international market, with oil prices playing a pivotal role. If oil prices surge, it will present a substantial challenge for the company. Nevertheless, I believe Petrobras can rebound by taking the appropriate measures. Ideally, the company should acknowledge its past mistakes and rectify them. However, the abandonment of development strategies and an uncertain pricing policy are sources of concern.I do not see the current government making the optimal decisions for Petrobras, and there remain numerous uncertainties about the company's future. The energy transition is also crucial, but oil remains significant in the Brazilian economy.Petrobras' stock seemed to have encountered a resistance of around $15 per share in mid-September, relying on favorable conditions, including lower Brent crude oil prices in the year's first half. Even as oil prices rose since July, the foreign exchange rate variation favored Petrobras, which I view as primarily the outcome of fortunate circumstances rather than reflecting the company's improved fundamentals.Considering that at the beginning of the year, amid political uncertainties becoming more evident in the market, Petrobras was stuck in limbo, struggling to break the $12 support until May. And that's where I predict the stock is heading, especially as more discouraging news continues to emerge, with the company trading at a forward P/B that is 17% above its historical average. Consequently, I maintain a bearish outlook on Petrobras for the long term.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Evolution Petroleum Is Going Conventional," () is a small company that has been very conservatively managed for as long as I can remember. A no debt  has been a priority until a spate of acquisitions disappointed the market. But the company listed weather-related and maintenance-related issues that are part of the business. Nothing listed in the earnings report accounts for the market reactionInstead, the market should have concentrated on the rather generous dividend that is supported by an extremely strong balance sheet. That $.12 per share  provides a yield that most investors report on average for a full year return on investments.Even in a disappointing quarter like the current one, cash flow more than supports the dividend. Note that accounts payable changes soaked up a lot of cash flow. That is a timing issue rather than a permanent cash flow decline. It does not, as a rule, represent a lessening ability to support that dividend.But this little operator has $11 million of cash and basically no long-term debt. Not only does the dividend support the stock price long-term, but the debt free balance sheet gives management considerable flexibility in the future to go after bargains, as it has in the past.The paydown of liabilities used about $7 million of cash flow in the current quarter. That kind of thing will happen with small companies. Even with that event (which is likely a timing issue), the company still reported a decent cash balance.Furthermore, the cash flow reported for the fiscal year was a generous (approximately) $50 million. This shows that the diversification program begun a few years ago is successful in lessening the dependence on the Denbury () joint venture. Investors have to keep in mind that a small company like this will have lumpy cash flow because expenditures can be rather large for the small company. going to be acquired by Exxon Mobil (), the immediate future is filled with far more reliability than the Denbury bankruptcy was. Exxon Mobil is a renowned operator with a far better reputation than Denbury ever had as a small operator (let alone a small one that went bankrupt). As management has noted several times, Denbury was clearly cash constrained. That will not be the case for Exxon Mobil.Probably the main danger of the Exxon Mobil acquisition is that this joint venture is considered a high-cost secondary recovery operation. Exxon Mobil is likely to review it for cost improvements and if none are available, Exxon Mobil management has a long history of selling interests in high-cost operators and reinvesting the cash in low-cost operations. So, this main source of a decent amount of cash flow may be facing a period of uncertainty.Much of the conventional assumption is that Exxon Mobil wants the carbon dioxide business of Denbury. Therefore, that same thought process assumes the secondary recovery business will be sold at some point due to the high costs of the business.Evolution management announced a joint venture with Pedevco. This is a conventional opportunity similar to the business run by Ring Energy (). This will take the Evolution Petroleum management further into more traditional upstream business while continuing to diversify away from higher cost secondary recovery business.Pedevco is a conservatively run company that was hurt badly by the events of fiscal year 2020. The reason was that the company had not finished transitioning to an operating mode from a concept company that was acquiring leases with the idea of developing them. This is similar to the Ring Energy story I have covered many times, except Ring Energy had more production going into fiscal year 2020.That still did not stop fiscal year 2020 from setting a lot of companies back. The market changed overnight from relatively friendly to demanding return of capital, while becoming very hostile to production growth. Since both companies (Pedevco and Evolution) are financially strong, the change in the debt market requirements did not affect either that much.On the other hand, finding capital to funding the growth of Pedevco became a real challenge. Now, this joint venture benefits both companies. Evolution is finally getting large enough to have access to low-cost production and growth it can control. Most of the acquisitions before this made it a partner in a situation with a well-established operator, where the operator controlled the partnership growth.The other advantage of this partnership is that the wells drilled in this conventional opportunity are either very cheap vertical wells or fairly cheap horizontal wells. Because this is a conventional opportunity that uses ""modern completion techniques, the decline rate will be slower than is the case for unconventional. Therefore, the cash needed to maintain established production will likely be lower as well.There has been a lot of talk about how declining natural gas prices have affected the total company results. The Barnett Shale purchase was established production that really has had no recent drilling. Older production is often high-cost production.But this part of the portfolio had an outsized impact on company earnings when natural gas prices soared last year. That opportunity may again arise in fiscal year 2025 when a considerable amount of export ability becomes available. It is very possible that the North American natural gas market will join the far stronger world market as North America heads from oversupplied to a larger natural gas exporter.Evolution Petroleum maintains a very strong balance sheet to offset the high cost of secondary recovery and the passive investment position in the partnerships. A lot of operators essentially control the pace of operations, including proposing capital expenditures and new wells. That has made this company consider a strong balance sheet as mandatory.The debt-free balance sheet considerably lowers the risk of investing in a small company. Likewise, the stock price downturn on the earnings report sharply lowers the risk of long-term investing principal loss. Management has long emphasized cash flow. So, this company tends to generate a lot of cash for its size. This company is a strong buy consideration with experienced management and conservative financial strategies, considerably lowering the risk of an upstream play (particularly a high-cost producer like this one) far below the risk of many larger competitors.Recent acquisitions have diversified the company away from the first and still major partnership with Denbury Resources. That partnership is likely in for a period of uncertainty once Denbury is acquired by Exxon Mobil. But then again, the company has other revenue sources.Management has, in the latest conference call, backed the recent dividend. The debt free balance sheet allows maintenance of that dividend for as long as the company chooses. However, should a deal float by, this upstream company, like many before it, could elect to use that dividend money for further growth and stability in the future.Upstream company distributions are not the same as utility company distributions. Investors need to remember that this company is upstream and highly dependent upon commodity prices when setting a dividend. The balance sheet is always the priority here. A big consideration of the balance sheet is to fund partnership requirements as needed.Still, that dividend has financial backing that is much better than many larger competitors. This little operator is a strong buy consideration on a stock price rout that really went overboard from the start of the announcement.The cash flow even in lean times is generous enough to pay the dividend and fund growth projects because this management prioritized ""lots of cash flow"" far in excess of capital requirements. That is unlikely to change in the future. Investors are generously paid with that dividend while waiting for more deals that will fund further growth. That strong balance sheet and the dividend protect against long-term capital loss. But small company stocks are very volatile, as today showed. Investors that consider this company for investing need to be aware of that.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

MP Materials: Approaching My Buy Zone,"MP Materials () is a company that has gathered a lot of attention as being perhaps the best way to get exposure to rare earth minerals mining in North America. It's a marketThe share price for MP has been a wild ride as it reached the top back in April of 2022 reaching almost above $60. It has since come down a fair bit as the market realized the prospects of earnings were perhaps overstated in the previous valuation. Production volumes for MP haveMP is a leading producer of rare earth materials within the Western Hemisphere and certainly in North America. The company operates in and management of the Mountain Pass Rare Earth mine and its state-of-the-art processing facility, both strategically situated in North America. Additionally, MP possesses exclusive mineral rights extending not only to the Mountain Pass mine but also encompassing the vast surrounding regions. This comprehensive control over rare earth resources underscores the company's pivotal role in supplying these critical materials to various industries.One of the driving factors of growth has been significant EV production ramp-ups in the last few years. A lot of the required materials and minerals used in the making of those vehicles are things that MP mines and supplies. This has created a unique environment where MP is viewed as a strong opportunity for securing rare earth deposit supplies in North America and taking some global market share from China.The US is a significant  for EV cars, but so is China, and getting rid of some of the reliance on that region is a key priority for them, and MP can help do so. I think that MP will continue to see strong demand in the coming years, but perhaps from an investment point of view MP doesn't look as appealing yet as the p/e remains to be quite high I think. We have to keep in mind that mining companies often get a lower multiple given the volatility and uncertainty about the material sales prices they can receive. With MP trading at an FWD p/e of over 60, I think we can rule out a buy right now.Looking beyond that though, it looks more appealing if the  can come true. If MP can execute its growth initiatives and the prices improve over the next few years, then perhaps an EPS of $2.78 in 2026 is possible. If the price remains the same the p/e would be under 8 and to me indicate an upside potential of 51% given a 12x earnings multiple. That is a potential realized return of 12.7% in that time. For me, I think I would want to look for some more improvements in the market conditions before going in, or a better potential return as well, somewhere closer to an annual return of 15%. That might sound high, but I think there are some inherent risks associated with commodity-driven companies that need to be baked into the valuation.From the last  I think it has become clear the MP can consistently ramp up the production levels, but perhaps not as able to raise the EPS as fast. MP is still at the mercy of the market and the demand for rare earth minerals that it mines for. As we can see above the realized prices for MP have been in a steady decline since last year. I think this comes as the war in Ukraine shocked a lot of the commodity markets and caused some prices to skyrocket, including the material that MP sells. I think that we will likely enter a period where prices stabilize somewhat though and MP could start seeing a further uptrend in the coming years.Looking at the financial  of the company I think it's fair to say that MP has had a tough time given the softer pricing environment. For the coming quarters, I think we need to see an improvement in the pricing environment before a potential buy could be issued.A significant concern I have regarding MP Materials is the persistently negative cash flows. This ongoing cash flow issue has resulted in share dilution over time, which has compounded the challenges for investors, especially considering the stock's decline from its previous highs of nearly $60 per share. It's reasonable to anticipate that share dilution may persist as long as negative cash flows remain a concern for the company. This aspect of MP's financials warrants careful consideration for potential investors.The ongoing share dilution should be a cause for concern for most investors, in my view. This is one of the reasons why I consider the company to be a hold at this point. I believe that MP has the potential to utilize its existing assets and mines to transition toward generating positive cash flows. For that to happen I think we need to see better production cost levels for MP, meaning a decrease from the current levels and also stronger realized price sales, which should hopefully over time be trending upwards in my opinion. For the moment though, I think that the management of MP is more focused on growing their portfolio of mines and projects rather than quickly raising the FCF. This will likely result in a continuation of diluting shares though.Back in July, I covered MP as well, and the rating I had for it was a hold. I tend to hold the same view now but I do think the price is approaching where I could consider it a buy. If it drops under $17 - $18 per share I think the potential rewards outweigh the risks and jumping in seems reasonable. For the moment though I think a hold rating seems fitting as the market processes are still deteriorating and lower EPS is certainly a possibility. A reversal is needed before a higher rating can be applicable.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

CVR Partners: Likely A Yield Trap,"Over the last two years, I've seen a lot of companies that look cheap due to higher commodity prices and higher prices on correlated services such as shipping, but end up being value traps as the supply chain issues present in 2022I think the opportunity with CVR Partners is that the yield is substantially reduced when fertilizer prices go down, which causes purely distribution-focused investors to sell out. This could longer term lead to a deep-value investing opportunity for investors who aren't just buying as a pure yield play.The biggest impact on CVR Partners is the macro environment and more specifically nitrogen fertilizer prices. Nitrogen fertilizer prices went up in 2021 due to high inflation, higher energy prices, higher demand, and years of underinvestment in the commodity complex. Then in 2022 prices skyrocketed even further due to the Ukraine War. In the process, the unit price for CVR Partners went up 22x from its 2020 lows. Over the last year, fertilizer prices have retreated and this showed up in the most recent quarterly earnings when operating income was down 40% over the prior quarter. While this is very bearish and the price is down due to this weak earnings report, I don't think the market has priced in how low fertilizer prices could truly get and how much that would impact CVR Partners. Below are fertilizer prices:Urea is what primarily impacts the revenues of CVR Partners, so that is where most of the emphasis should be put when doing analysis in my view. It's down from its high but is still nowhere close to where it was in 2021. When it comes to forecasting future fertilizer prices the trouble is that the fertilizer market doesn't have many liquid futures markets and unlike well-followed commodities like agricultural commodities there are few institutional analysts covering this space. So directly looking at inventories and demand for fertilizers is tough. Instead, I like to look at the main input into producing fertilizers which are natural gas and the energy complex; as energy prices go up it cost more to produce fertilizers so supply goes down and vice versa. Below is a chart of fertilizer prices and their correlation to both corn and natural gas prices:As can be seen, ammonia fertilizer prices are highly correlated to both natural gas and corn prices. This is because natural gas is a cost input and the agricultural industry creates demand for fertilizers. I want to start by looking at natural gas prices and where they are headed. The biggest trade in the natural gas markets since the Ukraine War was the arbitrage trade between European natural gas and American natural gas. American natural gas stayed cheap as the U.S. producers are producing all the natural gas that the U.S. economy needs, while natural gas in Europe went up due to the sanctioning of Russian imports. Below is the price of natural gas on Dutch front-month Natgas Futures:Below is the spot price for natural gas with the Henry Hub settlement:While both American-settled natural gas and European-settled natural gas contracts went up in 2021 and 2022, American natural gas didn't go up anywhere close to the amount that European natural gas did. This created an arbitrage opportunity where natural gas in the U.S. could be sent to Europe and the spread could be pocketed. Unlike oil, natural gas is very hard to transport; the only way to get natural gas from the U.S. to Europe is by turning it into LNG and then transporting it from an LNG terminal. In this process, there were also many hiccups such as the Freeport LNG terminal, one of the largest in the world, being shut down for two months due to a fire.Because this process is difficult the spread between American and European natural gas has taken a long time to get closer to converging. But now European natural gas prices have started to get to the point where it won't be as economical to import natural gas there from the U.S. Once this happens then the demand for American natural gas will go down.At the same time, production of natural gas in the U.S. is at all-time highs:With the production levels of natural gas continually going higher in the U.S. and with demand likely to slow significantly with the closing of the arbitrage between European and American settled natural gas contracts, it's likely that natural gas prices are headed lower.With a high probability of lower natural gas prices, fertilizer supply should go up.On the flip side, we want to look at corn prices and where they're headed to find out the demand situation for fertilizers.Below are the biggest corn-producing countries:CORN ETF:Initially, the war in Ukraine caused corn prices to spike as can be seen on the above chart. Since then prices of corn have retraced down, but it's still not down to 2019 levels yet.Similar to the situation with natural gas the corn market has reacted to the 2022 spike in corn prices by introducing more supply:With high inventories of corn in the U.S., there is unlikely to be a price spike over the next year. On top of this, even if the U.S. has a serve drought or other climate impacts over the next year it seems unlikely that corn inventories will go down a lot. This is because other parts of the world are having record production which will provide more supply over the next couple of months. Brazil for example has record corn production as seen in the chart below:Both 2021 and 2022 had a record 41.3 million acres of farmland, which in 2023 made a record 4.030 billion bushels. With more farmland than ever and record production for two straight years, Brazil is expected to outpace the U.S. in corn exports:Brazil is also increasing acreage at high double-digit rates:With corn production in Brazil going up, exports in the U.S. are dropping. This means there's an expected surplus supply of corn in the U.S. over the next few years. I think this will likely cause lower U.S. corn prices, making for lower demand for fertilizers.Overall the macro looks bearish on fertilizers with higher supply and lower demand. This does beg the question of why this bearish forecast on fertilizer prices isn't getting priced in by market participants. While UAN has come down from its highs its nowhere near where it was in mid-2021; the reason I use mid-2021 as a base level is because that is likely where fertilizer prices are once again headed as that is where it was prior to the supply chain and inflationary pressures in 2022. Keep in mind that the mid-2021 level is still generous as that is above where fertilizer prices were from 2014-2020. The reason I think that the bearish forecast hasn't been priced in is that UAN has attracted investors who invest purely for the yield. This can be seen by comparing the performance of UAN to peers in the same industry:As can be seen, the total returns for UAN far surpass peers in the same sector for the last three years.The yield for UAN is also the highest compared to peers:UAN has the highest yield by more than 11 fold. UAN is also structured in a partnership structure rather than peers which are structured as a corporation. This means that UAN is forced to make distributions to LPs which a corporation doesn't; there are pros and cons to both approaches, but often retail investors may see a high yield and buy without taking into account the risks involved with the yield and whether paying out a large distribution is actually the best capital allocation strategy for the company. I think this can be seen with the number of bullish articles on this partnership in mid-2022 at the unit price's peak:As can be seen, titles mentioned the high yield and how the units looked cheap. Since these articles were published the price per unit is down 35-40% and total returns are around negative 20%. My view is that many contributors similar to retail investors become bullish due to the low P/E ratio, growing earnings, and high yield, without understanding that the high earnings and high yield were a one-off event. There are also other minute issues such as many referring to the distributions as a dividend, which it is not. Now that last quarter's earnings were put out and we've already seen a 40% cut in the operating income and with likely even lower earnings ahead, I see the distribution getting cut by more than half over the next year, which would bring the distribution yield to around 17% or so, which is still high but nowhere close to where it used to be. The even bigger risk here is the left-tail risk from reflexivity. Most investors are familiar with the concept of reflexivity as it was popularised by George Soros but for those not familiar here's the meaning: ""Reflexivity is a theory that positive feedback loops between expectations and economic fundamentals can cause price trends that substantially and persistently deviate from equilibrium prices""(). A simple way to think about this is that the mean or average of something (could be anything not just in financial markets) is 10. Over the last two years, it's been at 15, so to get back to the mean of 10, it needs to spend the next two years at 5. Many traders make the mistake of thinking that it just needs to go back to 10 when it actually needs to overcorrect down to 5. This is the biggest risk here; commodity markets naturally mean revert. This means that when the price goes really high, market participants may overreact and introduce far too much supply causing the price to not just go back to its mean, but to overcorrect to the downside, and vice versa. I find this to be the biggest risk since so much supply is being introduced, as I discussed earlier, and in my opinion, most investors are ignoring fundamentals and just buying for the yield; if this corrects to the downside then UAN could get significantly undervalued as the retail yield trade unwinds and there is an oversupply of fertilizers.Fertilizer prices are down to mid-2021 levels and are likely to go lower, but the price per unit is around $25 above where it was in mid-2021. My view is that investors have been buying for the high yield without taking into account that these distributions will go down as fertilizer prices go lower. As the distribution goes down over the next few quarters the price is likely to go lower as investors buying for the high-yield sell out. This will likely overcorrect to the downside providing a deep value investing opportunity on the other side of a cyclical downturn.    Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Plains All American Yields Over 7% And Looks Undervalued,"Whenever I write about Energy Transfer () or Enterprise Products Partners (), the one company that consistently turns up in my valuation models as an undervalued opportunity is Plains All American (). IPAA is an interesting energy infrastructure company as its focus is predominantly throughout the centralized region of North America. While PAA provides critical infrastructure to our economy, it provides significant takeaway capacity and access to the U.S. and global energy markets for Canadian crude and NGLs. PAA operates 18,300 miles of  pipelines and has 74 million barrels of commercial crude storage capacity. PAA has 4 marine facilities and operates 7 crude rail terminals. On the  side of its business, PAA operates 1,620 miles of NGL pipelines, 9 fractionation plants, 4 processing facilities, and 16 NGL rail terminals. PAA is a full-service energy infrastructure company providing takeaway capacity through pipes, trucks, and rail, and storage for upstream exploitation and production companies to connect with refiners and exporters to international markets in the crude markets.Above is a picture of PAA's energy infrastructure across its asset base. Below is a map of all the petroleum pipelines and export/import facilities in the lower 48 portion of the U.S. according to the Energy Information Agency (EIA) . PAA's assets are at the heart of the American crude industry as they connect several basins to the most densely populated export/import location for American crude. Oil and gas aren't going away, and I feel investing in hard asset's is a theme that will become more popular as the years progress. PAA's infrastructure is next to impossible to be replicated by another company as the barriers to entry are immense for new companies to enter the space.PAA could have significant growth running through their pipes as the 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA () indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids, and natural gas will increase through 2050. The EIA also projects that the U.S. will remain a net exporter of oil and gas through 2050. My logic is simple as I follow what the government agencies responsible for energy are publishing. If the U.S. will grow its oil and gas production for the next 3 decades, then it will need excess transpiration capacity for these fuels. If the U.S. remains a net exporter, growing its oil and gas exports, then more fuel will have the Gulf Coast as a final destination. These are not my projections; they are the U.S. government projections, and I want to invest in companies that have infrastructure in these areas that can capitalize on the future growth in these areas. PAA is positioned to benefit from a growing domestic and international energy demand, and I feel unitholders can be rewarded with an appreciating unit price and growing distribution.PAA finished its  generating $33.67 billion in revenue, $2.5 billion in cash from operations, $1.32 billion in FCF, $10.22 billion in total debt, and having 728 million units outstanding. Based on the trailing twelve-month (TTM) numbers, PAA has grown its revenue by 52.16% ($17.56 billion) to $51.23 billion, its FCF by 76.64% ($1.01 billion) to $2.34 billion, reduced its total debt by -19.79% (-$1.92 billion) to $8.3 billion, and repurchased 29.6 million units, decreasing its shares outstanding by -4.07%. Today, you're able to purchase units below where they were prior to the improved balance sheet, financial growth, and lowered unit count.PAA has also strategically strengthened its company to capitalize on the future of American energy.  closed on its 43% acquisition of Diamondback Energy's () interest in OMOG JV LLC for approximately $225 million. This was funded through excess FCF, and further aligns PAA with FANG in the Midland Basin. PAA has updated its 2023 guidance and expects to come in the high end of its range for Adjusted EBITDA of $2.45 - $2.55 billion while decreasing its leverage to under 3.5x. PAA is expecting its FCF to come in around the $1.6 billion level in 2023, which will allow it to further reduce its debt load and should help provide future distribution increases.Like some other energy infrastructure companies, PAA reduced its distribution in 2020. Since then, PAA has improved its financial position, reduced debt, and provided 2 distribution increases. The quarterly distribution has grown from $0.18 to $0.27 in less than 2 years, and considering PAA is expected to retain $600 million of its $1.6 billion of FCF in 2023 after distributions, there is no reason for me to believe that increasing the distribution further isn't part of the gameplan. The current valuation looks discounted, provided the progress PAA has delivered.For Midstream Operators, I look at the enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA, total debt to Adjusted EBITDA, the market cap to Adjusted EBITDA, market cap to distributable cash flow, and distribution yields. This helps me determine if there is an opportunity in one midstream units over another. PAA has always looked strong, and I am specifically looking at PAA based on these metrics.I will compare PAA to the following companies:PAA trades at the lowest valuation on an enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA methodology, slightly under ET. The peer group average for this metric is 9.31x, and PAA is trading well below this at 7.86x.From a market cap to Adjusted EBITDA perspective, PAA also looks undervalued, trading at 3.53x compared to a 5.52x peer group average. PAA trades at a slightly higher multiple than ET but significantly below the rest of its peers.I want to pay the best multiple I can for DCF, and PAA is trading at 5.8x its DCF compared to the peer group average of 7.19x. ET is the only other company from the peer group that trades under a 6x multiple on its DCF.From a debt perspective, PAA trades at the lowest ratio as its total debt to Adjusted EBITDA is 2.77x. The peer group has an average of 3.3x, and PAA is the only peer that trades under 3x. From a leverage position, PAA looks attractive.PAA has a distribution yield that exceeds 7%, but it's under the 7.78% peer group average. While I love a large yield, I am willing to invest in a smaller yield where the company has strong underlying fundamentals and ratios.PAA looks very interesting, and while I am not a unitholder, I am certainly considering adding PAA to my income-producing portfolio in the future. I think PAA is undervalued as its assets provide critical infrastructure to the oil and gas industry and are positioned to benefit from a growing demand for traditional energy. As the U.S. continues to increase production and exporting loads, I think PAA will see increased amounts of fuel running through its system and ultimately drive revenue and FCF higher. Based on the valuation, PAA could be an interesting acquisition target in an industry that has seen continuous consolidation through M&A activity. At a $23.5 billion enterprise value and $10.56 billion market cap, PAA looks interesting for an investment and as a target for an acquisition.

Teens are buying iPhones 'near record levels' but Apple Watch interest has slipped,"Investment firm Piper Sandler is out with its latest research report into the health and buying trends of America's teenagers and the firm noted that the picture for Apple's () hardware is a bit more mixed than in theAccording to the survey, which questioned 9,193 teenagers (with an average age of 15.7 years) across 49 states and captured more than 2.4M data points across buying patterns and industries, ownership of Apple's iPhone is still near record levels, at 87%. Similarly, the purchase to intent is still high, at 88%. ""We believe the elevated penetration and purchase intention are important given the mature premium smartphone market,"" the analysts wrote in a research report, summarizing the trends. ""Additionally, these trends are encouraging as the company continues to introduce new iPhones proving the overall stickiness of the product portfolio. We think these positive trends can also be a catalyst for further services growth as well, as the install base for Apple hardware continues to grow.""Delving deeper, Piper Sandler found that Apple Pay is the number one payment app used in the last month at 42%, followed by Block's () Cash App at 27%, suggesting Apple's services are benefiting from its ecosystem.(Conversely, Cash App was the most used app for peer-to-peer money transfer at 50%, followed by PayPal's () Venmo at 36%.)However, the picture is a bit more mixed when it comes to the Apple Watch. Piper Sandler found that while total smartwatch ownership rose to 39.1% in the most recent period, up from 36.9% in the fall of 2022, Apple Watch owners were flat, at 34%. Additionally, the intent to buy an Apple Watch was down, with 10% planning to buy one in the next six months, compared to 16% in the fall 2022 survey.Last month, Apple ()  the iPhone 15, along with the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 at its annual product extravaganza.There may be a bit of silver lining for Apple, as it pertains to the Apple Watch, especially amongst upper-income teens.

In the most recent survey, 42% of respondents said Apple was their favorite watch, while just 33% mentioned Rolex.",35,2023-10-10T15:17:10.000-04:00
Wesdome Gold Mines: A Strong Q4 Needed To Meet Guidance Midpoint,"The Q3 Earnings Season for the Gold Miners Index () starts next week and one of the first companies to report its preliminary results is Wesdome Mines (). Unfortunately, the company's Q3 results came inWesdome Mines released its preliminary Q3 results last week, reporting quarterly production of ~27,800 ounces of gold, a 21% increase from the year-ago period. However, while the headline result seems impressive, production was down over 10% sequentially and the company was lapping very easy year-over-year comps from the prior-year period, with Q3 2022 being a kitchen sink quarter. This was related to lower-than-planned grades at the Falcon Zone and 15 and 24 days of downtime, respectively, at Eagle River and Kiena. Fortunately, Wesdome should still be able to hit its guidance mid-point, but it's going to need a ~32,900-ounce quarter to do so. Hence, while I previously saw the very low risk of a miss on the guidance midpoint as of Q2 (49.4% of guidance), tracking at ~72.6% of the guidance suggests minor uncertainty for hitting the mid-point.Digging into Wesdome's production results in a little closer, its Kiena Mine saw improved production of ~7,400 ounces of gold on the back of higher throughput which was offset by lower grades (4.9 grams per tonne of gold vs. 10.2 grams per tonne of gold). That said, while production is tracking at just ~66.9% of the mid-point, Kiena Deep ramp development to the 129 Level remains ahead of the company's internal schedule (~1,700 ounces per vertical meter vs. ~1,000 ounces per meter in current mining areas) and grades are also coming in better than planned year-to-date, with head grades of ~5.0 grams per tonne of gold ahead of guided grades of 3.7 to 4.7 grams per tonne gold.That said, Kiena is going to need higher throughput and grades to meet its 35,000-ounce guidance midpoint, with ~11,600 ounces needed in Q4, which would require ~55,000 tonnes at 6.7 grams per tonne of gold just to hit the mid-point (or higher grades if throughput comes in lower). So, while there's no question that Wesdome will mine much higher grades starting in Q2 2024 (positively impacting its production levels at Kiena), it's not clear whether the asset will meet its FY2023 guidance midpoint.Moving over to the company's Eagle River Mine, production came in at ~20,400 ounces, a 17% increase from the year-ago period. However, as noted, the company was up against very easy comparisons relative to Q3 2022 with negative grade reconciliation in the prior-year period at the Falcon Zone and planned downtime for mill thickener refurbishment work. Digging into the results a little closer, Eagle River processed ~55,000 tonnes at 11.9 grams per tonne of gold, an 11% improvement from the year-ago period. And while Kiena is tracking behind its guidance mid-point, Eagle River has picked up slack from no contribution from Mishi, with ~63,400 ounces produced year-to-date, sitting at ~75% of its annual guidance midpoint.As for recent developments, there has been little to report on, with just one release since the Q2 results announced in July. However, the results were quite encouraging, with Wesdome reporting more solid holes from the Presqu'ile Zone that lies just 2 kilometers west of its main mining operations, and with this potentially being a future source of mill feed to top up the hungry Kiena Mill (permitted for 2,000 tonnes per day). As highlighted in the release, the company intersected 2.9 meters at 32.5 grams per tonne of gold, 4.0 meters at 14.0 grams per tonne of gold, and 4.3 meters of 9.3 grams per tonne of gold, and the average grade and width from the PR2 and PR2-A zones at Presqu'ile was ~3.4 meters at ~8.8 grams per tonne of gold.Looking at the above resources, we can see that the average intercept was slightly better than the average grade of ~7.7 grams per tonne of gold across indicated and inferred resources at Presqu'ile, with a total resource of ~340,000 tonnes or ~85,000 ounces of gold. This is certainly encouraging, as is the fact that Wesdome has its permit in hand (initially planned to begin in Q4 2023) to drive an exploration ramp at Presqu'ile which will not only provide a secondary access point to convey material but will also reduce ventilation costs for the mine. In addition, this will allow the company to test the down-plunge extent off Presqu'ile Zone to east towards the PR2 and PR2-A zones, and the ability to tie in this exploration ramp to its existing ramp network might mean other mining opportunities down the road, such as going after high-grade ounces on Level 33 east of the Kiena shaft at Dubuisson (~154,000 ounces at 6.6 grams per tonne of gold).Overall, the fact that the current program has confirmed the continuity of mineralization at Presqu'ile is very positive, and not only does this potentially add new catalysts (investors can look forward to results from potential down-plunge extensions at this zone besides Kiena Deep drilling), but it also suggests that Kiena could be capable of much more than the ~100,000-ounce production profile envisioned. And while it's early to estimate potential mining rates and grades, an extra 700 tonnes per day to the mill at 6.5 grams per tonne of gold from Presqu'ile could translate to another 50,000 ounces of gold per annum, which could make Wesdome a ~220,000 ounce producer in 2027 between Eagle River, Kiena Deep, and Presqu'ile.Based on ~152 million fully diluted shares and a share price of US$5.80, Wesdome trades at a market cap of ~$880 million and an enterprise value of ~$900 million. This leaves it as one of the higher capitalization junior producers in the market today and also one of the more expensive names from a P/NAV standpoint, trading at ~0.87x P/NAV vs. some junior producers with similar production profiles elsewhere in Canada at 0.60x or lower. That said, and as I've highlighted in past updates, Wesdome deserves a premium, owning two of the highest-grade gold mines globally and operating in solely Tier-1 jurisdictions. Hence, although it may look expensive at first glance relative to other names like Karora (), New Gold () and Orla Mining (), some of this premium is justified.Using what I believe to be fair multiples (premium to peer group) of 1.10x P/NAV/P/CF and a 65%/35% weighting (P/NAV/FY2024 OCF estimates, respectively), I see a fair value for the stock of US$7.40 on a fully diluted basis. This points to a 28% upside from current levels, which leaves Wesdome undervalued, especially if it can continue to execute its plans under new CEO, Anthea Bath. However, I am looking for a minimum 35% discount to fair value for small-cap producers to ensure a margin of safety when starting new positions. If we apply this discount to its estimated, Wesdome's ideal buy zone comes in at US$4.85 or lower. So, while I saw the stock as a Buy in January below US$4.60 and started a position in the stock given that it was trading at a steep discount to fair value, I don't see a low-risk buy zone just yet.Obviously, I could be wrong and my buy target may be too ambitious, but I prefer to buy when miners are being given away and hated, not when they're only moderately out of favor and trading at only a 30% discount to fair value. This is because they are highly cyclical and depleting businesses that encounter the odd setback (even for the best teams), meaning that there's simply no need to invest unless the odds are stacked heavily in one's favor. To summarize, while I see Wesdome as one of the better-run names and a top-10 junior producer, I continue to see more attractive bets elsewhere. One name that stands out currently trading at a massive discount to fair value is Marathon Gold (), which trades at less than 0.30x NPV (8%) just 13 months away from its first gold pour.Wesdome Mines is one of the more unique stories in the market today, with it being the proud owner of two high-grade mines in safe jurisdictions when jurisdiction has never been more important (Kumtor nationalization, Russia conflict that led to dumping of gold assets, security concerns in West Africa, and Mexican mining law reforms). However, the story is even more special given that its mills both have excess capacity, suggesting that Wesdome could potentially double its production from FY2022 levels (~120,000 ounces) by optimizing these assets vs. having to do M&A like other companies. That said,  of this already looks priced into the stock at a ~$900 million enterprise value, and while the stock is undervalued, it's not what I would consider near fire-sale prices. So, I remain neutral short term and see the more attractive buy zone being at US$4.85 or lower.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Dorchester Minerals: Expecting An Average Quarterly Distribution Around $0.80,"Dorchester Minerals ()  for Q2 2023 that was approximately 32% lower than its Q1 2023 distribution. This was not all that surprising since it has a variable distribution tied to its cash receipts and Q1 2023 benefitedDorchester's Q2 2023 sales volumes are closer to what I would normally expect Dorchester to average, although natural gas prices (with NYMEX averaging barely over $2 during the quarter) in particular were quite poor. Dorchester does not hedge its sales volumes.I expect Dorchester's quarterly distribution to average close to $0.80 per unit during the second half of 2023, with its Q4 distribution likely a bit higher than its Q3 distribution. I am I've previously noted that Dorchester's sales volumes (particularly its NPI sales volumes) can vary a lot from quarter to quarter. Thus I had used Dorchester's Q4 2022 sales volumes as a general baseline to represent an average quarter.This still appears to be a reasonable assumption. Dorchester's natural gas sales volumes went down 26% from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. Its oil sales volumes also went down 14% over the same period.However, Dorchester's natural gas sales volumes were up 3% in Q2 2023 compared to Q4 2022,while its oil sales volumes were down 2% in Q2 2023 compared to Q4 2022 (which has one more day than Q2). Thus Dorchester's production levels were very similar in Q2 2023 compared to Q4 2022.Dorchester Minerals has a variable distribution tied to its cash receipts. Dorchester's Q2 2023 distribution ended up being significantly lower (at $0.676818 per unit) than its Q1 2023 distribution, which was $0.989656 per unit. This was a decrease of approximately 32%.This quarter-over-quarter distribution decrease appears to be due to a combination of lower sales volumes, lower commodity prices and the timing of Dorchester's cash receipts.Dorchester's Q2 2023 cash receipts from its Royalty Properties were down 6%, including a 12% decrease in receipts related to current period sales. The current period for Q2 2023 was March to May 2023, while the current period for Q1 2023 was December 2022 to February 2023.A 12% decrease is close to what I'd expect in a scenario with roughly flat production growth, given the changes in commodity prices between the two sets of current periods.On the other hand, Dorchester's cash receipts attributable to its Net Profits Interest declined by 71% quarter-over-quarter. Dorchester's NPI sales volumes went down by 43% quarter-over-quarter while commodity prices were also lower. The 39% quarter-over-quarter decrease in current period receipts is actually less than I'd expect, but the change in receipts from prior periods was very high and seems to be due to timing. that it acquired mineral and royalty interests totaling around 900 net royalty acres (and involving approximately 17,000 gross acres) in Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas.The consideration for these interests was 343,750 common units worth approximately $11 million at that time.This appears to be a relatively minor set of transactions (involving multiple unrelated third parties) that adds less than 1% to Dorchester's outstanding common unit count.I am keeping Dorchester's estimated value at $32 per unit based on my long-term commodity price expectations of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. I believe that Dorchester can deliver a quarterly distribution averaging approximately $0.80 per unit in that scenario.As noted above, Dorchester's distribution can be fairly variable from quarter-to-quarter, but one should focus on long-term averages rather than short-term spikes and dips in its distribution.For the second half of 2023, I'd expect Dorchester's distribution to average around $0.80 per quarter, with Q4 2023 likely to be higher than Q3 2023 based on strip.Dorchester is a solid (and debt free) company that looks capable of generating a 10.5% yield based on my long-term commodity price estimates and Dorchester's current unit price. Dorchester's potential for capital appreciation looks relatively limited currently, but its average quarterly distribution should be around $0.80 per unit. There may be significant variance from quarter to quarter (such as with Q1 2023 and Q2 2023), but overall I believe the quarterly distribution can average out to around $0.80 per unit.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

USO: The Next Oil Bull Market May Have Begun,"The oil market has been stuck in a relatively tight range over the past ten months. The range began when I last covered the crude oil futures ETF () with a bullish long-term outlook due to the impending Since the end of June, oil prices have risen sharply from ~$70 to over $80 per barrel, causing a ~20% rally for USO. The rally slowed over the past three weeks as oil returned to its resistance level of ~$83. That said, if oil breaks its pattern of falling back to $70, it would indicateIndeed, that may be a reasonable outlook as oil's fundamentals have turned potentially bullish. If it were not for negative economic perspectives, oil may be much more expensive since storage levels are low and are generally still falling. However, oil prices are depressed because many expect economic demand for gasoline and other oil products to decline over the next twelve months. Even if the recession concerns prove correct (which I believe), I suspect the market is  due to recession concerns. Further, the oil prices are low due to depressed demand outlooks, many oil producers are rapidly reducing drilling levels since oil is near or below the breakeven cost for drilling new wells in certain regions.Thus, oil production may fall faster than demand. A potentially significant oil rally may occur due to another shortage. Given much lower storage, and specifically SPR inventories, there is almost nothing the US government could do to stop a shortage if it returns. Given  and US producers will likely cut production should the oil ever fall below $70, USO may be a great opportunity today due to its downside protection and potentially significant upside.US oil production levels are currently the highest since COVID-19 first struck the market. Total US continental production spiked significantly over recent weeks, likely due to efforts by companies to push products out before hurricane season ramps up and inevitably creates supply issues. Thus, realistically, oil production remains stagnant today as it has throughout 2023, given the recent spike has come before seasonal disruptions begin. However, future production levels are likely to start to decline, as indicated by the falling US and global rig count levels. See below:Since most oil wells experience significant production declines during their first year or two, a constant stream of new wells must be drilled to maintain continuous production. In most circumstances, there is some lag of around six months between changes in the rig count and changes to production, besides extreme events such as those in 2020, where wells were forcibly shut down. The US and global rig count peaked around the beginning of the year and have been falling at an accelerating pace (at least in the US) due to lower prices, indicating US production levels should begin to wane more significantly over the coming months. inventories (""DUCS"") are also very low after extremely high ~2021. These wells have allowed oil producers to rapidly increase production after COVID lockdowns ended without spending significantly on new capital investments. Looking forward, because the supply of DUCS is lower, a higher rig count should be needed to maintain constant production. Of course, despite a falling rig count and low drilled but uncompleted well levels, the EIA believes oil production will rise in 2023 and . In my opinion, the EIA may be biased because it seeks to encourage drilling to aid the government's objective of keeping gas prices low. That said, the EIA suspects production will continue to rise despite lower rig counts due to increases in per-well output efficiency. More due to the ongoing rig count decline. Crucially, demand for oil services i are less interested in paying for capital upgrades to improve efficiency.Although the oil production outlook is essential, the broader context of low inventories may be more critical. I believe it is most likely that US oil production levels wane over the coming six months and potentially longer if prices remain depressed. Although CapEx levels have risen across significant oil producers, they're at around half or less normal levels for Chevron (), Exxon (), and others, indicating a general reluctance to invest in growth, contrary to the 2010s trend. More importantly, oil inventories are very low and are still declining, indicating that the US market is still in a shortage today. See below:The price of crude oil has a strong, historically inverse relationship with total oil storage levels. Total US oil stocks are around 30% below normal levels, with the SPR down by about 50%. These sources can continue to draw down for some time; however, the US has much less emergency capacity than before, so it would likely be unwise for more SPR withdrawals to occur outside of emergencies. The Biden administration due to concerns that doing so would exacerbate the shortage in commercial oil markets. Thus, for the most part, the SPR is likely a non-factor regarding future production. However, should oil prices fall rapidly due to rapid demand declines, I believe refilling would occur, probably ensuring the oil remains around breakeven levels for most US and international producers ($60-$70).Given the chronic declines in oil storage levels, it would seem crude should be much more expensive today. However, many oil producers in the US and abroad remain highly concerned about changes in demand, given the industry's struggle with a glut from ~2012 to ~2020. Historically, oil demand has some correlation to economic activity, but recent trends suggest it may not be as strong as it used to be. Consumer sentiment has a tight relationship with oil refinery capacity. The manufacturing PMI (an industrial growth indicator) also has some relationship, with refinery capacity use usually falling when manufacturing activity slows. However, manufacturing growth and consumer sentiment are very low today,. See below:Oil companies and likely international producers track leading economic data to determine changes in drilling levels. In my view, oil companies and the oil futures market appear to behave as if demand will decline over the coming year due to chronically strong recession indications. In recent months, the popular  has skyrocketed to 66% for 2024, the highest since the 1980s and slightly above its levels before the two major 2000s recessions. So, oil companies are reducing drilling activity and other investments concerning a recession, yet oil demand remains exceptionally high despite economic circumstances.Indeed, since 2020, normal economic patterns have been thrown out the window due to the impacts of inflation, immense QE and QT from the Federal Reserve, and other abnormalities. As one of many examples, US air travel reached the summer, even though most US households are seeing sharp declines in discretionary income, only to be offset by . Thus, there is some denialism among US companies and households where, although economic strains are growing, the reaction to them is more limited than in the past.This trend may mean that oil consumption remains elevated even if the economy slows, as people continue to pursue vacations, travel, and spending even if . Of course, around 2010, many people were buying much more efficient vehicles to save money on gasoline. Today, that is not feasible because conventional cars are not becoming much more efficient, and electric vehicles are generally too expensive for those trying to save. Thus, although oil producers are cutting output in concern of a recession, demand could stay strong even if one occurs. That said, a significant slowdown is undoubtedly the most bearish possibility for USO and other oil-related investments.In my view, USO is a solid opportunity today. For one, much lower than it used to be due to inflation impacts, making it a solid portfolio diversifier. Secondly, lower production, lower inventories, and resilient demand could promote a significant rally in oil prices. Thirdly, although a recession or potential production improvements  stop a new shortage, OPEC+, SPR refill efforts, and US oil companies will likely respond to a <$70 oil price by cutting output or buying oil for the SPR. Thus, USO benefits from a potential floor at that level, giving it an estimated downside risk of around 10% to 20% in a significant global recession.Lastly, the US oil futures curve is in backwardation, meaning longer-dated oil futures contracts are discounted to the spot price.  is around 5-6% annually. This backwardation indicates that the oil market is in an acute shortage, which may be a bullish factor. More importantly, it means the ETF USO will be rolling its contracts at prices below spot, so its contracts will appreciate as they reach expiration. Currently, contracts are around 50 cents cheaper each month, so they'll rise by that degree each month if the spot price remains constant. This situation is great for investors in USO because it gives the ETF a ""roll yield"" that may offset potential declines in spot prices. Further, it means USO will not underperform spot prices as it had during glut periods that created ""contango"" when futures prices are above spot (causing USO to lose money as its contracts expire).Combined, all of these factors give USO an excellent risk-to-reward profile. Without a doubt, USO has a risk of declining. In reality, I believe the probability of crude being lower 12 months from now is about equal to the likelihood of it being higher due to recession risks. However, should oil decline due to a recession, I believe its downside is limited to the $60 to $70 range due to production cut support from weary producers as well as artificial demand support from SPR refills that would likely only occur in a glut. If oil demand remains strong and supply wanes, crude could rise over $100 per barrel again due to lower inventories. Even more, USO has added support due to backwardation in the oil futures curve. Its correlation to the S&P 500 is low, giving it portfolio diversification benefits - and ""real life"" hedge benefits against rising consumer gasoline costs.Overall, these factors make USO one of my favorite and few bullish targets today, not because it should make anyone rich but because it likely offers a far superior risk-reward trade-off and diversification benefits than most stocks and bonds.

ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,"Energy MLP stocks were a bright spot in a challenging third quarter for equity markets, with the Alerian MLP Index returning 9.89% as the S&P 500 Index (, ) declined 3.27%. Supply cuts from OPEC+ combined with lower U.S. inventories pushed oil prices higher, fueling further inflation and interest rate concerns — a headwind for broad equities, but a positive for energy stocks.The dynamics affecting the MLP market remain unchanged. Global economies continue to face multiple headwinds, led by a combination of stubbornly high (though recently moderating) inflation, elevated geopolitical uncertainty and lingering supply chain and policy impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S., we have begun to see the dampening effects on the economy of tighter monetary conditions. During 2022, equity markets began pricing in a reasonable chance of recession, both in the U.S. and abroad. Thus far in 2023, global equity markets have recovered most of the losses incurred during 2022 and expectations are increasing that developed economies might avert a severe recession.Crude oil prices fell from more than $120 per barrel in June 2022 to ~$70 per barrel to end June 2023. Recession fears left oil market traders fearful of global demand downdrafts for crude oil in 2023 much like those witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis (GC). A stronger U.S. dollar and large-scale releases of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) further pressured oil prices. On the other hand, demand fear was partially offset by some optimism for a rebound in China consumption with the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. The surprise OPEC+ supply cut of 1.1 million barrels per day at the end of March also likely puts a floor on oil prices over the near term. With better visibility on global demand impacts from rising interest rates, oil prices steadied and rose in July, August and September.Essentially all of this oil demand growth is expected in developing nations, rather than OECD nations. We would argue that oil prices of roughly $70 per barrel at the end of June discounted that oil demand growth will not approach levels expected by oil economists in 2023 and 2024. Said differently, oil traders seem to expect a material contraction in global oil demand growth rates compared to oil economists. A final twist to oil demand analysis remains the timing of the U.S. refilling its vastly depleted SPR. After drawing down the SPR by roughly 275 million barrels (or ~45%) in the previous 18 months, the U.S. government announced in June initial plans to begin refilling the SPR beginning in September. Thus, what has been a meaningful source of supply in the crude oil markets will become a source of demand looking forward.If global oil demand growth does approach roughly 2 million barrels per day in 2023 and another 1.0-1.5 million barrels per day in 2024, we see upside in oil prices over the balance of 2023 and into 2024. The supply side of the global oil market will meaningfully struggle to meet that kind of demand growth. We would also argue that the incremental barrel of oil supply in such a scenario will almost have to be a barrel of U.S. oil — continuing to drive visibility in U.S. oil production growth to the benefit of U.S. midstream companies.Looking at natural gas, the short-term outlook is decidedly negative while the intermediate- to long-term outlook remains robust. An almost complete lack of typical weather last winter left natural gas storage levels 32% higher at the end of March 2023 than a year before. Higher storage levels entering the spring and summer also equates to lower natural gas demand to refill storage levels. As a result, U.S. natural gas prices fell from above $5 per mmbtu at the end of March 2022 to $2 per mmbtu at the end of March 2023. In our view, pricing for U.S. natural gas will not meaningfully recover until the beginning of winter (with an effective reset on storage levels).With continued organic domestic demand growth and increasing demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the international markets, the intermediate- to long-term outlook for U.S. natural gas prices and necessary production levels remains constructive for U.S. midstream companies.Valuation for U.S. midstream companies remains well below the levels seen before the pandemic. Entering 2020, enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiples stood at roughly 10.5x. Despite the rebound the sector has experienced since the March 2020 lows, the sector today trades at 8.4x — despite what we view as a vastly better business model. Dividend/distribution coverage has moved from 1.1x to more than 2.0x. The sector has moved from being free cash flow negative to free cash flow positive (increasingly so in 2023) and balance sheet leverage (debt/EBITDA) has moved from more than 5.0x to below 3.5x. With no need for midstream companies to access capital markets for the foreseeable future, we increasingly expect excess cash flow (above and beyond capital spending and dividends/distributions) to be used for increasing share buybacks and further increasing dividends/distributions.With improving financial metrics and continued low valuations, we still see solid upside potential for the U.S. midstream sector despite strong performance in 2022 and thus far in 2023.The ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy underperformed its Alerian MLP Index benchmark during the third quarter. In terms of absolute performance, all four subsectors in which the Strategy is invested made positive contributions, with the diversified energy infrastructure subsector contributing the most and the natural gas transportation & storage subsector the main laggard.On a relative basis, the Strategy underperformed due primarily to stock selection effects. In particular, stock selection in the liquids transportation & storage and natural gas transportation & storage subsectors detracted.In terms of individual holdings, Energy Transfer LP (), Targa Resources (), Plains All American Pipeline LP (), Cheniere Energy Partners LP () and Magellan Midstream Partners LP () were the main contributors.

SM Energy May Generate Over $700 Million In 2024 Free Cash Flow,"SM Energy () looks capable of generating approximately $1.15 billion in free cash flow during 2H 2023 and 2024 combined at current strip prices. This also assumes a slightly above maintenance capex budget that results in mid-single-digits production growthI am keeping my expectations around long-term (after 2024) commodity prices at $75 oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. At those long-term commodity prices, I value SM at $48 per share, assuming that commodity prices follow the current strip (including low-$80s WTI oil) in 2024. This is a couple of dollars per share higher than my , reflecting increased near-term free cash flow expectations.One area to keep an eye on is SM's realized price for NGLs, which represent approximately 17% of SM's total production. NGLs account for approximately 35% of SM's production inThe higher BOE volumes coming out of the liquids-rich Austin Chalk have contributed to South Texas accounting for 53% of SM's total production in Q2 2023, compared to 43% in Q2 2022. SM's Midland Basin production declined -12% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022, while its South Texas production increased by +28% over that same period.SM mentioned that its NGL composition is around 49% ethane, 24% propane, 12% natural gasoline, 8% butane and 7% isobutane. It realized $42.08 per BOE for its NGLs in Q2 2022 but is realizing in the low-to-mid $20s per BOE for its NGLs now.Based on SM's NGL composition, I estimate it would realize approximately $22 per BOE for its NGLs in 2024 at current strip.Since I last looked at SM Energy in August, projected oil prices for the second half of 2023 have become a fair bit stronger, while natural gas prices (for the same period) have decreased slightly.The current strip of around $85 WTI oil and $2.80 NYMEX gas for the second half of 2023 results in a projection that SM can generate $1.3 billion in revenues after hedges during this time period.Thus SM may be able to generate $424 million in free cash flow during the second half of 2023.I am modeling SM's 2024 results at 157,000 BOEPD (43% oil production). This is mid-single digits growth compared to its expected 2023 production.At the current 2024 strip of low-$80s WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX gas, I project that SM will end up with $2.631 billion in revenues after hedges.If SM ends up with a $1.1 billion capital expenditure budget to grow production by mid-single digits, then it would end up with $728 million in free cash flow during 2024, before any impact from cash income taxes. This assumes that SM will run an average of 5.5 rigs during 2024.I am continuing to maintain my expectations around long-term (after 2024) commodity prices at $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. At those commodity prices, I now estimate SM's value at approximately $48 per share. This assumes that commodity prices match current strip until at least the end of 2024.SM may be able to generate over $6.50 per share in free cash flow in 2024 at current strip prices, assuming that it continues to repurchase shares. This amount of free cash flow also involves a capex budget that is above maintenance capex, as it should be able to maintain production levels with $1 billion (or slightly less) in capital expenditures.SM Energy looks capable of generating around $1.15 billion in free cash flow in 2H 2023 and 2024 combined at current strip, while also growing production modestly. This will allow it to continue to share repurchases while also putting aside money to pay back its upcoming note maturities via cash on hand.Strong near-term commodity prices boost SM's value to around $48 per share in a long-term $75 oil and $3.75 gas scenario, assuming that oil prices remain higher than those long-term prices during 2024.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

First Solar: Growing Capacity And A Growing Backlog Equals Growth,"First solar () was founded in 1990 and was incorporated in 1999. In 2002, they finished their first commercial production facility in Perrysburg, Ohio with the capacity to create 1.5 megawatts per year. Today, First Solar is the largest producer of solar panels inFirst Solar will be building their  for a cost of $1.1 billion located in Louisiana. Funding for this new facility is partly due to the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in August 2022. It is expected to come online in 2026 bringing 3.5 more gigawatts of manufacturing capacity per year adding to its existing 11.5 GW. Just this year alone, the company has made plans to spend an additional $1.7 billion at a new site in Alabama and by expanding a facility in Ohio.At current production levels, and with no new orders, the company has a backlog that will last until at least 2030. The slide below shows their backlog at different dates in the blue bars. And the green demonstrates how their backlog is growing throughout 2023. In other words, their order backlog is outpacing their ability to produce solar panels. This is an encouraging sign for investors.The following slide demonstrates the total opportunities that are available in the solar industry for First Solar to go out and get. This demonstrates that even though they have a backlog that will last until 2030, the potential to extend that backlog is also there.Currently, the subsidies that individuals can receive for installing  are up to 30% of the cost of the panels according to some sources. This is set to continue from 2023 all the way until 2032. This provides some strong visibility into the future demand for solar panels.In addition, First Solar was able to begin building a fifth plant using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act. And so we can see that the solar industry is subsidized on the capital funding side as well as on the demand side.I am not going to evaluate what percentage of First Solar's profit is dependent on subsidies in this article, but it is important to know that a certain percentage of both First Solar's demand and their capital investments are subsidized.I rarely like to invest in a business that requires subsidies from the US government or any government, however, many people have become fabulously wealthy by investing into government tax breaks, whether that be local or federal tax breaks. And so while I might shy away from companies like this, others might see this as an opportunity.Going forward, the question I will be interested in, is what will the economics of solar panels be when the subsidies run out in 2032? Will they be able to produce panels economically enough for subsidies to not be necessary? I don't know the answer, but I think that based on First Solar's backlog, they will have plenty of opportunities to find ways to make the panels more economical and with the full force of the climate-change narrative and the government funding backing the industry, I wouldn't expect First Solar's backlog to experience any kind of decline. So I would love nothing more than for the solar industry to be able to create energy that no longer requires subsidies. Time will tell.As of this writing, First Solar has a $20 billion market capitalization. So is this cheap or is this expensive relative to the performance of their current business? Let's measure this relative to operating cash flow.Here are the cash flows from operations for the past four years. With a $20 billion market cap, I believe First Solar is a little over-valued relative to these cash flows. I won't discuss their balance sheet in this article, but First Solar also has a strong balance sheet. The question is, will First Solar's cash flows grow dramatically over the coming years? They certainly have potential growth catalysts in that they are expanding their manufacturing facilities. For argument’s sake, let's extrapolate that in 2024, First Solar will have Cash Flows From Operations of $1 Billion. Even then, at today's prices, you will be paying 20x for operating cash flows.Another question one might ask is, why is cash flow from operations so ""lumpy?"" For example, through the first half of 2023, cash flows from operations were negative. Why? One of the reasons cash flows are so lumpy is because any time an industry is subsidized, cash flows will continue to be sporadic because receivables will tend to stack up and then get paid all at once.For example, through the first half of 2023, First Solar's net income was $213 million. However, on their cash flow statement, they have the following deductions which caused cash flow from operations to be negative. Most of these are receivables and although I didn't do a deep dive into the footnotes to understand what these receivables precisely are, we can clearly see that some of it is related to subsidies in the form of ""grants."" This is one of the caveats to investing in this industry. First, cash flow as well as capital costs are, to a certain extent, subsidized and therefore, cash flows might behave in a staggered fashion.For further guidance, here is the company's guidance through the end of 2023.Simply put, First Solar is going to grow larger than they are right now. I know that is a profound statement but the point I want to make is that I wouldn't invest in something just because it's going to grow. Yes, the business is on solid footing thanks to a really strong backlog of work that at its current production capacity will last to 2030 and likely beyond. There are a lot of new projects that they have the potential to win by 2030 as well. And with $3 billion in capital projects in process in order to expand their manufacturing capacity, this creates opportunities for growing income. And last but not least, the United States government has chosen to heavily subsidize their industry.However, the subsidization that this industry receives is also one of the drawbacks. I expect their cash flows to continue to be lumpy, until their industry is self-sustaining without so many subsidies. Do I think it will eventually get there? Yes, I do, but it isn't there right now. And perhaps one can make the argument that for that reason, this presents a good time to buy.Lastly, when deciding what to invest in, it must be a relative comparison. In other words, to invest in one thing is to say NO to investing in another. And so although I think your capital can grow by investing in First Solar today, there are other investments that I believe present a better opportunity. And therefore, I can only rate First Solar a HOLD.In case you haven't read my other articles, I am . My bullish timeline is for at least the next 6-7 years, as I believe the industry is positioned much better than the solar industry. The oil industry is much more established and the net gains from the energy provided by hydrocarbons is greater than that provided by solar. Because of this, many of the oil and gas companies pay attractive dividends with strong balance sheets and predictable cash flows. Not to mention, companies like  () are valued more fairly relative to operating cash flows.And when comparing one form of energy (solar) to another form of energy (oil & gas), I want to position myself with the one that performs the best without government subsidies. In an inflationary or stagflationary environment, I do not believe solar will perform as well as hydrocarbons.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Amplify Energy: A Long-Term Winner On Valuation And Quality Assets,"Investing into oil and gas might not be exactly what has been hyped over the last few years as many renewable and solar companies saw their valuations skyrocket. But when the prices for those increased and ultimatelyThe company is included in the oil and gas exploration and production industry where it primarily focuses on engaging in both acquisitions and developments of oil and natural gas in the United States. The need for these resources is unlikely to diminish anytime soon and I think there isOne of the major benefits of AMPY right now is the solid asset base they have consisting of solid and low-decline projects across the US.The are diversified and span across Texas and some parts of California too. The assets are long-lasting reserves and are likely to continue yielding AMPY solid returns over the coming several decades.One of the major benefits of having such assets is the consistent cash flows they can generate from them. The 5-year  of FCF margins for AMPY is a very strong 25% which is far above the sector average of 6.23%. I think this should equate to a higher premium for the company and a p/FCF of around 6 - 7 should be applied for sure. With sector beating margins a premium is valid and the proven stability of it as well further adds to that argument. That would put a price target of around $14 - $16 for the company, indicating a significant upside from current prices.While it's a common perspective to view the future of oil and gas through a negative lens due to the ascendance of renewables, the narrative is more nuanced than a simple relegation of traditional energy sources. The landscape of energy generation is indeed transforming, with renewables gaining prominence and advocating for a cleaner and more sustainable future.Even as ambitious emission targets are set for , the practicality of completely eradicating oil and gas from the energy mix is complex. These resources continue to offer a reliable and accessible energy source, particularly in regions where alternative options are still developing. Furthermore, the extensive investment in oil and gas infrastructure, including refineries, pipelines, and distribution networks, underscores their role as integral components of our energy ecosystem. Despite the above having data until 2021, I think it quite clearly showcases the dependence the US has on both oil and gas to generate energy to support the massive grid they have. This is unlikely to shift in the short term and makes investments into AMPY still very appealing.Looking at the from the last quarter we can see that AMPY had some decent results actually as production levels were up around 9% on a YoY basis. Net cash generated during the quarter was $4.9 million and EPS came in at $0.24, a massive beat from the expected $0.13 for the quarter. This hasn't translated into a higher share price as AMPY posted strong results. Instead, the share price has remained in the same range and that leaves us with a solid opportunity still to capitalize and invest accordingly.On a QoQ basis, the FCF was down a fair bit to $6.1 million, but AMPY still has performed quite well maintaining solid margins. The company also reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 and the CEO briefly mentioned that some of the challenges placed on the company in the last 2 years are residing and more positive times seem to lie ahead. I think for upcoming quarters the most important factor to look out for will be an increase in the production levels of the company, this would indicate a more positive and demand market condition for AMPY which with solid operation performances will raise margins and the share price as well.While the company has subtly alluded to the possibility of divestitures, it's intriguing to consider the alternative scenario where they veer in the opposite direction. Given the company's existing low leverage, a strategic shift towards initiating acquisitions could potentially trigger a downward trajectory in the stock's trading performance.Should management opt for a divergent course by pursuing acquisitions, the implications on the stock's valuation could be noteworthy. Acquisitions entail not only financial implications but also strategic alignment and integration challenges. A misstep in this arena could reverberate through the stock's performance, leading to a lack of investor confidence and consequent price depreciation.Besides the mentioned risks with AMPY, I think another one worth considering is the fact that volatile commodity prices are likely to place slight pressure on AMPY to continue posting quarterly growth. I think it might be unlikely for them to do that all the time, but that is the nature of the oil and gas industry. As long as the asset base is solid then there is little to worry about in my opinion, which is the case with AMPY.Investing in oil and natural gas is still very much a good opportunity for investors in my opinion. AMPY has showcased resilience and with a great margin of safety for investors, the company looks very appealing to start a position in. As we mentioned earlier, the company has a solid historical FCF margin thanks to the asset base they have developed.If we applied a 6 - 7x FCF multiple we are left with an upside of over 100%. Even if we don’t necessarily reach that, the potential still far outweighs the risks here in my opinion. For investors that seek to start a long-term position in an oil and gas company then making AMPY one seems highly advisable right now. Rating AMPY a buy right now.

Algoma Steel: Deeply Undervalued Steel Producer Undergoing A Radical Transformation,"Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome River Capital Investor as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SAAlgoma Steel () () is a Canadian steel producer that, I believe, is significantly undervalued by the market. Though there are currently cyclical concerns in the steel industry as a result of recession fears, Algoma Steel's cost model makes it so that they can generate significant cash flow even when steel prices are low. In the next year, through the modernization of their plate mill, Algoma will be able to produce double their current steel plate production, increasing income significantly. Looking even farther out, the company is currently undergoing a switch from BasicAlgoma Steel is a steel producer located in Sault Ste. Marie on the Great Lakes. Its current production capacity is 2.8M tonnes per year. It has many normal elements of production for a BOF producer with an internal coke oven, slab caster, strip mill, but its most notable machinery are its Direct Strip Production Complex (DSPC), Cold Mill, and Plate Mill, which give it a large differentiator in terms of product cost and quality. As of current,  with the rest being Canadian customers, with the top 10 largest customers making up 50% of sales, and another 150 making up the latter half, all across a diverse set of industries. The company, over the last 30 years, has been through multiple bankruptcies and restructurings due to steel price collapses and bad governance, but now, it is my opinion that proper governance practices have been restored.The major driver of long-term value for Algoma Steel is its transition to an Electric Arc Furnace from the Blast Oxygen Furnace method of production. By mid-to-late 2025, the EAF will be operational at 70% capacity, with it being fully done by 2030, though benefits will be realized earlier.It is my belief that maintenance will be slashed from $110M CAD to $60M CAD a year, when comparing to EAF peers, crude steel capacity will increase by 900kt, and increasing employee efficiency as no employees are planned to be added, but revenue will increase significantly.This should all result in an outstanding 30%-35% ROIC for the project, with a total cost of $850M CAD, of which 40% has already been spent, and 25% of the remaining cost will be covered by a grant, lowering project budget risks significantly.Though this is a smaller project, the company is currently undergoing a modernization project for its plate mill for a , of which $90M CAD has already been spent on phase 1, which improved production quality. This first phase focused largely on quality of steel plates, with it taking longer than expected due to ""software intensiveness."" I have evaluated the problems and determined the issues weren't of fault of management, and it should not occur in the second phase as management and workers are competent & experienced.The second phase will improve automation and double production capacity from 350kt to 700kt. Though this only expands downstream capacity, it adds value because steel currently used to make hot rolled sheets (HRS) can be used to make steel plates, which carry a significant price and margin premium of $832/MT over HRS, or double their price. Though it is hard to calculate ROIC, at current prices, it adds roughly $270M CAD in incremental revenue simply due to high prices, which should translate to $50-$100M CAD in incremental EBITDA, an even higher range of ROIC than the EAF project.The plate Mill Modernization project should be fully complete by April 2024, and then a 6-month ramp-up period subsequently occurs. This represents the most near-term direct catalyst, with the EAF project milestones in spending and building representing the derisking of project expenditure and modeling increasing. There is also the more clear catalyst of improved earnings due to higher steel prices.In this last quarter, the company produced  and $150M CAD in OCF ex-CNWC, with . Along with this, the company, , had $300M CAD in cash on hand, $134M CAD in SIF grant funds available, and $115M CAD in governmental loans. When this balance sheet position is combined with the expectation of $150M CAD more in liquidity being released from inventory over the next couple of quarters, the company will have enough cash available to fund the entirety of the remaining costs of the EAF project, without relying on debt or cash flow.This financial position and lack of reliance on future cash flow for project funding significantly derisks the two projects, in my opinion, as it allows for the company to be evaluated on its current merits and future possible growth.Looking at the last quarter to understand how undervalued they are compared to peers, their discount can be clearly visualized:Of course, this is only looking at one quarter, given none of these players had any large event skewing performance, it gives a solid visualization of just how undervalued Algoma Steel is relative to peers.Because we can't just look at one quarter to base our investment thesis off of, let's get a look over the next few quarters.Looking at the next few quarters, I expect the total cost per ton to stay the same at $990 CAD/MT as a result of fixed price contracts, though due to the fact that coal prices have dropped since the last time contracts were negotiated, it is likely that by the end of 2023, cost will come down around $40-$60 CAD/MT based on the 1.3M tonnes of coal bought annually for current production levels of 2.3M tonnes of steel.Now we can calculate the sales price for the third quarter of 2023. Here is the pricing model I used for sales price expected in Q3 2023 as of September 15th, which incorporates the contract pricing they have based on steel indices:Using these shown prices and a $990 CAD/MT cost expected, EBITDA should be roughly $200M CAD in Q3 2023, which makes sense considering the $187M in EBITDA and a $1323 CAD/MT Net Sales Price (NSP) and same cost structure in Q2 2023.Also, to add some insight into Q4 2023, if I just plug in the current prices into the model shown, the result is a nice $1230 CAD/MT NSP and $140M CAD in EBITDA.Though I don't believe that Algoma Steel should be trading at the same valuation as EAF peers like Nucor and Steel Dynamics yet, they most definitely should be trading at a similar valuation to Stelco, a Canadian steel producer with similar quality production, efficiency, and positioning. Using the given multiple of Stelco's 2.3x for Algoma Steel's valuation, we calculate a 120% upside or a per-share price of $15.34 USD compared to the current price of $6.92 USD.The company has 24.17M warrants outstanding due in November of 2026 with an exercise price of $11.50. Their current price is very cheap at $1.12, though if you are playing it safer by only buying the shares, to avoid future dilution, it would be wise to purchase warrants at a 1:4 ratio to common stock will offset this dilution for only 4% more cost to offset 25% in possible dilution.This is a worst-case scenario valuation where all cash on hand and non-debt liquidity is used to fund its two growth projects which fail to materialize any net benefit. Assuming the highly probable scenario that the EAF transition and PMM come to fruition, the upside will be significantly greater due to the benefits previously mentioned. The valuation for this scenario is not included as it is dependent on a variety of variables that needlessly complicate the currently clear opportunity.There is the clear risk that Algoma Steel is a cyclical company and is entirely reliant on the price of steel it can fetch and the cost of its inputs (coal, coke, iron, industrial gasses, etc.), though this is partially mitigated through its eventual transition to EAF reducing price sensitivity on the cost side due to the correlation between the prices of steel sold and scrap steel used for productionThe EAF transformation project incurs additional costs or delays above current expectations, though this is partially mitigated by .In conclusion, I view Algoma Steel as a greatly undervalued opportunity in the Steel industry not only because of its predicted $340M CAD in EBITDA or 35% of the market cap over the next two quarters, but also because of its plate modernization and Electric Arc Furnace projects create a situation with both compelling short-term and long-term value creation.  We own a long position in both the common shares (ASTL) of Algoma Steel, and its publicly traded warrants (ASTLW) Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"VinFast: More Risks Than One Can Bite, A Strong Sell","Mr. Market, in the short-term, is not always right. Whatever the reason may be, in the short term there are sometimes irrational phenomena that should be avoided at all costs, and today, I strongly believe that VinFast's (For investors who are unaware of VinFast: VinFast is a Vietnamese automaker that is targeting global aggressive growth, which includes the company's ambition in the US. The company is building a factory in North Carolina with an expected production to take place in 2025 to tackle the US EV market. However, as is the case with all new players in the market, the company is not yet profitable and has not reached mass production levels yet.In an ideal world, VinFast could be a perfect investment target. The company is small andIn reality, much of the hype that is supporting the current obscenely high valuation of VinFast stock is a reason to sell the stock. Production schedules are tentative dates as investors have seen in other EV newcomers such as Rivian () and Lucid Motors (), only 1% of the company's stock is being traded in the public market posing extreme volatility risks, and future demand for these vehicles is uncertain, and the company's valuation is simply unsustainable. For these reasons, especially the fact that only 1% of the company's outstanding shares are publicly traded, I strongly believe that investors should sell VinFast.Before talking about the multitude of reasons why VinFast may have a difficult journey ahead of the company, I would like to talk about the company's valuation first. It is natural for a young company to receive higher premiums on future potential even when accounting for some risks; however, for VinFast, because the company is valued for absolute perfection, I believe it is reasonable to point out all the risk factors.VinFast, at the time of writing (8/24) has a  of about $110 billion, which makes VinFast more valuable than numerous reputable global automakers including GM () and Ford (). In fact, VinFast is worth more than both GM and Ford combined. Even when comparing VinFast to Rivian and Lucid Motors, VinFast's market capitalization far outweighs these automakers.Without even diving deep, one can quickly understand the absurd premium VinFast is receiving. The chart below shows the three companies' quarterly revenue, and as the chart shows, VinFast's revenue seems nonexistent compared to GM and Ford.Revenue is not the best way to measure a company's valuation, but given that VinFast is not profitable with no clear path to profitability in sight, I believe the chart above is enough to convey that the company's market capitalization is absurd.On top of VinFast's market capitalization being extremely high compared to other automakers, the company's financial health and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth are weak.In  submitted to the SEC, the company had current assets of about $5 billion, which included about $159 million in cash and a total of about $1.87 billion in current assets. However, The company had about $1.75 billion in long-term interest-bearing loans and a total of about $7.2 billion in liabilities surpassing the total assets bringing the stockholder deficit to about $2.15 billion.I believe the balance sheet is extremely weak, especially for a company that is not profitable with no clear path to profitability in the near future. Understandably, going public likely provided the company with billions in extra cushion on top of the backing from Vietnamese conglomerate VinFast Group, but the fundamental problem still plagues the company's already weak balance sheet.On the revenue and operating loss aspects, the situation is even direr for the company. In the quarter ending on March 31st, the company lost about $600 million, which is about 63% higher than the previous year. The increased losses are likely normal as the company is investing heavily in expanding its manufacturing footprint; however, as an investor, it is hard to look past the company's financial situation.Overall, I believe VinFast's current valuation is too expensive. Despite the company having a poor balance sheet, heavy losses with no clear sight of profitability, and significantly lower revenue than its peers, VinFast is trading at a higher market capitalization than GM, Ford, Rivian, Lucid Motors, and many other established and new automakers.One may argue that VinFast's future potential justifies the company's rich valuation, but I do not believe this is the case.  as of today are merely 11,300 for EVs and 20,000 for E-scooters year-to-date. Then, what about future production capabilities? The company claims that they have the capacity to produce 300,000 vehicles annually with an additional 150,000 vehicles once the US plant starts production in 2025. As the company has also shown in an infographic, without exact detail, the Vietnam factory has the ability to scale further, and the actual planned production capabilities could be higher. Yet, whether the 2025 production capability of EVs and E-scooters is 450,000 or 900,000 does not justify the current valuation as the company has proved nothing as of today.It is impressive that VinFast was able to enter the EV market at a breakneck speed, but as has been the case for all new competitors in the industry, there are too many risks and uncertainties. One can claim that they will achieve A and B, but the reality may be different for a multitude of reasons.Numerous companies, both legacy and new companies have shown that mass production is difficult and prone to unseen problems. In 2018, Tesla struggled to bring its now-popular Model 3 to .  and  in recent years have also had their own respective hiccups in mass production. But, these hardships are not isolated to new companies.  is also seeing delays in producing Lyriqs. As such, whether the hindrance to an ambition plan is supply chain issues, demand issues, macroeconomic issues, or technical difficulties, numerous companies have shown that mass-producing electric vehicles is difficult. Thus, until VinFast can prove, to some extent, that its ambitious goals are realistic, I believe the risk of cost overruns and delays is inevitable.Also, one thing to note for VinFast investors is that VinFast is slightly different from its North American counterparts. The company also sells inexpensive electric vehicles including e-scooters and mini trucks priced at far below vehicles sold in the North American or European markets. For example, while 11,300 electric vehicles were sold, 20,000 e-scooters were sold showing that reaching certain production goals could be less profitable for VinFast than other companies. Although it is hard to tell today as the company has just gone public, I believe it is important to note that there is more to it than just the headline numbers.Finally, even if the company is able to achieve mass production in a timely manner with minimal cost overruns, the demand for the company's vehicles is questionable. The picture below is a comparison of Google () , and it clearly depicts that VinFast has lower brand recognition or interest compared to Lucid Motors and Rivian, a new player in the North American Market. Considering that Lucid Motors is producing almost double the number that the company is delivering due to demand, it is questionable if VinFast could successfully deliver all the vehicles the company has. It is too early to conclude whether my concerns are legitimate or not, but I believe VinFast is exceptionally ambitious in targeting 150,000 production goals in North America starting in 2025.Overall, I believe it is a stretch to argue that VinFast will be able to not only achieve its aggressive production goals but also create customer demand for its vehicles in a short span of time.Finally, my biggest concern apart from the company's valuation comes from the available shares. Only  of VinFast's outstanding shares are traded in the public market. I believe this to be risky and likely the reason behind the extreme volatility in the company's stock. With thin volumes, share price movements become more volatile or risky for long-term investors.On top of the volatility potential investors have to endure from a thin volume of publicly available shares, I believe the management team's intent is not aligned with the new shareholders of the company. It is, in my opinion, clear that the management team does not want to share any voting power with the public while wanting to gain as much capital from the public. It seems as if the company is viewing its investors not as a partner or a co-owner but as only a source of capital. Likely knowing that the company's shares will be volatile by only making 1% of the shares available, it is hard to conclude that the management's interest is aligned with its public shareholders.Further, the management team has created an environment where the majority of the company stock's trading volume comes from retail investors. VinFast has not allowed any . One cannot trade options on the company's stock. With extreme volatility and no easy way of hedging the position, big investment firms will likely steer away from the company's stock leaving only retail investors.With a combination of thin volumes and a reduced institution's presence, VinFast's stock will likely continue to be extremely volatile, and I do not believe that this is in the shareholders' best interest as it likely promotes short-term trading over long-term investments. Thus, as the management team has created this unique environment, I do not believe that the management team will act in favor of the shareholders in the long term, and even if my claim is wrong, I do not believe it is safe to invest in VinFast today due to extreme volatility that will likely ensue from this unique environment.I strongly believe that VinFast is not a great investment option. The company's valuation is extremely rich as VinFast is worth more than numerous established and new automakers who are ahead of the competitive curve. Further, the company has not yet proven if the company will be able to achieve mass production or have enough demand to deliver the vehicles. There are too many promises and no real proof yet. Finally, I believe the potential volatility coming from small tradable shares along with no options to hedge one's position creates immense risks for long-term investors. Therefore, I strongly believe that VinFast is a sell.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

A Path To A >20% Distribution Yield: Why I'm So Bullish On Range Resources,"On September 25, I wrote an  titled . As bullish as that article title was, it was in noAfter getting a lot of questions, I will dedicate this article to one of my favorite natural gas plays, the .In addition to Antero Resources () and Tourmaline Oil (), I believe Range Resources is one of the best natural gas stocks money can buy. Not only because I'm bullish on natural gas, but because its characteristics are truly special.The company has deep reserves, very low breakeven prices, a healthy However, be aware that natural gas stocks tend to be more volatile than oil-focused investments. My natural gas investments are part of my trading portfolio, not of my long-term investing portfolios. The exposure is also lower.I am not saying that because I don't fully stand behind what I will tell you in this article. I'm saying this because elevated volatility can be an issue. Steep rallies often come with temporary setbacks. On top of that, the general bull case for natural gas is a bit weaker than for oil, as supply growth is stronger.Having said that, I believe there's tremendous value in Range Resources and that prudent investors can double their capital if natural gas continues its uptrend.So, let's get to the details!Range Resources is an operator in the Marcellus Basin, which is located in the beautiful Appalachia. It's also the reason why I often go with a header picture of that region whenever I cover an Appalachian-based energy company.During the years of the Great Financial Crisis, the Marcellus wasn't a factor in global energy markets. At least not in natural gas.Back in 2009, the U.S. produced roughly 10 billion cubic feet of dry shale gas per day. Now, that number is close to 85 billion cubic feet per day. The biggest player is the Marcellus basin.Range Resources, with a current market cap of $7.7 billion, produces a big chunk of this total output.In Q2 2023, the company's net daily production averaged 2.08 billion cubic feet equivalent. 67% of this was natural gas. The remainder was natural gas liquids (103 thousand barrels) and oil (7 thousand barrels).In its second-quarter , the company noted that it plans for additional production growth.The company's production strategy is expected to drive a significant sequential growth of approximately 30 to 50 million cubic feet a day in the third quarter, ultimately aiming for an end-of-year production level of approximately 2.2 BCF equivalent per day.High production numbers are great but a small part of the thesis. Even more important is that the company has very deep inventories with very low breakeven prices.The company has an almost unmatched inventory of 30 years' worth of production. It has 3,000 undeveloped drilling locations that are breakeven below $3.00 MMBtu, which is extremely low.Almost two-thirds of its undeveloped drilling locations are breakeven below $2.00 MMBtu!Even better, the company is the most efficient gas producer among its American peers. Looking at the chart below, we see that the company's free cash flow breakeven is slightly above $1.00 MMBtu.Not only does this mean that RRC turns into a cash cow at elevated natural gas prices, but it also means that it can still drill profitably when others are forced to reduce output to protect their balance sheets.This comes with a huge margin of safety. For example, if natural gas prices decline, peers will start cutting output, lowering supply. That tends to stabilize prices before RRC gets into trouble.Right now, we're once again in a period of decline rigs, as unprofitable producers are cutting output.On a side note, half of the company's gas is transported to the Gulf Coast. Half of these volumes are turned into LNG for exports. I expect that number to rise dramatically over the next few years, allowing RRC to benefit from better pricing and longer-term contracts.Going back to its operations, a part of its efficient operations is its advanced drilling process. In the second-quarter earnings call, the company emphasized the continuous improvements by its drilling teams, setting new records and achieving program milestones.Notable achievements included drilling longer lateral wells, displaying increased lateral length by 5%, and achieving the longest laterals in the program's history, nearing 22,000 feet.The average daily lateral footage drilled also surged by 42% compared to the 2022 full-year average, showing promising prospects for future development programs.Related to the aforementioned comments and numbers, it is no surprise that the company has much lower capital spending per Mcfe.Thanks to these numbers, investors are increasingly benefiting from two major tailwinds.In 2021, when commodity prices were still subdued, the company spent all of its free cash flow on debt reduction. Last year, it generated more than $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Most of it went to debt reduction.As a result, the company has just $1.6 billion in net debt, which is a mere $100 million above its target.Next year, the company is expected to end up with $1.2 billion in net debt, which would translate to less than 1x EBITDA. Please bear in mind that analysts assume no major buybacks (they almost never do).It is very likely that RRC will refrain from further lowering its debt after it hits its target, which is what I expect and one of the reasons why I like this stock so much.Also, approximately 50% of the company's natural gas for the remainder of 2023 is hedged, with an average floor price of $3.42. For the year 2024, a similar strategy is in effect, hedging around 50% of natural gas at an average floor price of $3.70. This is achieved through a combination of swaps and collars, allowing for potential upside to approximately $5.50.Additionally, the company initiated a modest hedge position for the year 2025, targeting an average price of $4.12 for natural gas.This is what the company said in its 2Q23 earnings call (emphasis added):The current dividend yield is 1%, which is nothing to write home about.However, if energy prices rise, the company is in a great position to reward investors with double-digit distribution yields consisting of both dividends and buybacks.Putting a valuation on a commodity-driven stock is always tricky. After all, energy prices have a massive impact on earnings in the case of RRC and its peers.With regard to the natural gas outlook, the company is bullish.Historically low prices observed in the second quarter are expected to improve later in the year, driven by robust LPG exports from the U.S.The growth in exports, in conjunction with moderating supply growth, is anticipated to restore storage levels to balance later in the year.During its earnings call, the company also highlighted the positive trends in ethane prices and strong demand, positioning the company well to capture both international and domestic opportunities, supporting their NGL guidance range for the year.On top of that, the company sees a longer-term divergence between demand and supply growth, driven by massive LNG export capacity expansions and a shift from coal to natural gas - among other reasons.Once economic growth rebounds, I expect this trend to be amplified.Given that the company has a 23% free cash flow yield at $5.50 Henry Hub, I believe that the stock has the potential to double once we reach these gas prices.I do not expect that to happen over the next few months. However, on a longer-term basis, I'm very bullish on natural gas and expect long-term elevated prices to support aggressive buybacks, further debt reduction, and related improvements that pave the way for a long-term (albeit volatile) uptrend.If I didn't own AR shares, I would be a buyer of RRC at these levels.However, as I said in the introduction, RRC and its peers are volatile. Be aware of these risks and always do your own due diligence.Range Resources Corporation stands out as a prime natural gas investment.RRC shows remarkable production growth potential with deep reserves and low breakeven prices, making it a standout in the natural gas sector.Its disciplined financial approach, highlighted by prudent debt reduction and conservative hedging strategies, adds to its attractiveness to investors.Although we're dealing with a very volatile and risky market, I firmly believe that RRC has the potential to offer significant returns, especially if gas prices trend upward in the future.However, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider the risks involved before making investment decisions in this dynamic sector.I am mainly buying oil-focused stocks and will add to my smaller natural gas trades on weakness.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Steve O'Hara, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. O'Hara, you may begin.Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call this morning. I'm joined on the call today by Andy Nemeth, CEO, Jeff Rodino, President; and Matt Filer, Interim CFO.Certain statements made in today's conference call regarding Patrick Industries and its operations may be considered forward-looking statements under the securities laws. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the company's control, which could cause the actual results and events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.These factors are identified in our press releases, our Form 10-K for the year ended 2022 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update these statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.I would now like to turn the call over to Andy Nemeth.ThankOur success would not be possible without their hard work, attention to detail and commitment to excellence and quality customer service. Our team continues to be driven by a purpose and passion for the great outdoors and the impact our branded quality, innovative products and services can have as we strive to elevate the customer experience for our valued partners in the outdoor enthusiasts and housing markets.Over the past few years, our strength, resilience and results have reflected the benefits of our strategic diversification, and this quarter was no exception. In spite of the fluid dynamics of our end market landscape in the face of challenging macroeconomic environment, specifically related to the highest interest rates in more than 20 years, our team and flexible business model continue to adapt and perform, our balance sheet remains well capitalized with plenty of liquidity, and our cash flow is evidenced the underlying strength of our portfolio of branded companies that drive our organizational model.In addition to the benefits of our diversification and strategic model, our three end market-focused businesses have unique advantages that complement each other in our portfolio. Our RV focused business units generally have highly leverageable variable cost structure that is also highly scalable up and down in alignment with real-time changes to production levels.Our marine focused business units generally have a higher fixed cost structure that generally delivers a higher engineered core competency value proposition. And our housing focused businesses generally offer us a more stable, low overhead platform with a low fixed cost structure that is highly leverageable, especially in the event production volumes improve.Many of our businesses cross pollinate in manufacturing competencies, continuous improvement opportunities, product lines, capacities and markets, allowing us to constantly synergize and continue to bring new innovations to our customers.The current general theme across our end markets from our perspective can be broadly centered around the overhang of high interest rates and their impact on retail consumer sales conversion, dealer inventory stocking and overall increased hurdle rates for return on capital.Over the last 15 months, OEMs in the RV industry have skillfully managed their production downward, showcasing the industry's real-time scalability, adaptability and maturity. As we head into the fourth quarter, we see the industry currently matched in a period where retail registrations and wholesale production are closely aligned and positioned for a one-to-one basis and very nimble, ready to pivot.Our teams have done an exceptional job of flexing our cost model in alignment and executing on numerous automation initiatives to improve our productivity, throughput and efficiency. And we will continue to support our OEM partners diligence and remain prepared to respond swiftly when we need to ramp up production or scale back further if needed.On the marine front, as we noted last quarter, marine OEMs have responded in real time to inventory restock calibration in the field in partnership with what we believe similar to the RV industry is a cautious dealer base that appears extremely sensitive to inventory imbalance in the channel and the high carrying cost of floor plan financing.Retail on the marine side has held up better than we expected with OEMs and dealers alike intent on keeping dealer inventories and their floor plan costs as low as possible in this environment and extremely manageable.On the housing front, our housing markets, both manufactured and single-family multifamily, have also been very disciplined in their production and build schedules in markets where we believe there is and expect will continue to be a shortage of overall housing inventory.Beginning in mid-fiscal 2022 and carrying through fiscal 2023, we have worked to identify and eliminate costs without compromising the quality and reliability of our operations. On an annualized basis in 2023, we eliminated an estimated $100 million in total costs, enhancing our ability to maintain margins as we respond to market conditions and industry trends.Our margins have remained resilient amid slowing marine production and what we now expect to be the lowest RV production in 10 years. Our team's disciplined execution on labor and cost management in addition to our investments in automation and continuous improvement helped drive gross margin improvement of 170 basis points, while our operating margin declined just 10 basis points despite the 22% reduction in net sales.Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points from the third quarter of 2022. From a working capital perspective as well, we have continued our disciplined inventory management strategy that enabled us to reduce inventory by $37 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $150 million year-to-date and more than $215 million in the last 12 months further evidencing the nimbleness of our operating model and our team's ability to adeptly and successfully manage working capital.These measures have not only bolstered our financial stability, but have also paved the way for us to seize opportunities and maximize the profitability of our business when production increases in the future.The core of our business is built around a brand front-end foundation anchored in the entrepreneurial spirit, focused on our innovative full component solutions model. We strategically and organically built a product offering that strives to deliver a good, better, best value proposition with our strategic diversification representing a further extension to bring the best solutions to our customers. We offer customers a full line of products, both up and down scale in order to meet their needs along a continuum of feature and price.Our goal is for our customers to be confident that we have what they need to design, engineer and build their RVs, boats and houses no matter what category of product line they are producing.With RV OEMs looking to reduce their ASPs in this environment, the importance of our good, better, best model is clear and evident and remains the cornerstone of our brand forward go-to-market strategy. With this model, we expect to continue to gain share, which will continue to pay dividends when production levels increase.The strength and resilience of our operating model, liquidity and competitive leverage position has enabled us to be proactive and strategic in a cautious environment and further invest in our foundational model to continue to future-proof our business and drive off of our already solid foundation.As mentioned, our brands and the strength of their teams are the foundation of our company, driving our innovation and the engineering of new products every year, bringing new ideas and solutions to our OEM partners. As we continue to be forward thinking, we plan to further enhance and embed our strategic value proposition.One example, as we head into the last quarter and upcoming model year is our deep focus on collaboration across business units to create a seamless process to improve product solution innovation through the creation of Patrick's Advanced Products Evolution group.This independent focused engineering team will work closely with our already established innovation team and together will help our brands collaborate, shorten product development times and elevate our commitment to excellence as we look ahead to the exciting rollout of model year 2025 units and beyond in our markets.Before we highlight our third quarter year-over-year financial performance, let's revisit the 2019 comparison we've made in the past two quarters that we believe demonstrates the improved resiliency and profitability of Patrick. In the third quarter of 2023, RV wholesale unit shipments were 21% lower than the same period in 2019. Despite the sharply lower unit volumes, total revenue in the third quarter of 2023 was 53% higher than 2019.Gross margin was 460 basis points higher and operating margin was 160 basis points higher, helping drive a 97% increase in EPS versus the same period in 2019. In addition, this quarter, we generated $105 million of free cash flow versus $24 million in 2019. Compared to our results last year, our third quarter revenues decreased 22% to $866 million. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our consolidated revenues were approximately $3.6 billion.Our net income in the third quarter decreased 33% to approximately $40 million, and net income per diluted share was $1.81. As a reminder, we are comparing to a prior year period where we hit third quarter records related to revenue and net income.Our team delivered another impressive cash flow performance this quarter with operating cash flow of $115 million, implying free cash flow in the quarter of $105 million. We ended the third quarter with total net liquidity of approximately $700 million which along with our free cash flow reflects our prudent financial management and heightened ability to execute on growth opportunities while maintaining the flexibility to continue to pivot and whether current and future macroeconomic challenges and opportunities.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff, who will highlight the quarter and provide more detail on our end markets.Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. On third quarter RV revenues, which represents 46% of our consolidated total decreased 24% to $400 million when compared to the same period in 2022.Our RV content per unit decreased 2% on a TTM basis to $4,957 per unit driven by our actions to pass along favorable pricing to our customers, reflecting certain declining commodity costs and smaller units taking larger percentage of production mix, partially offset by market share gains.Additionally, from our operating perspective, OEMs returned to a more predictive production schedule in the third quarter, which allowed us to better allocate our resources and plan further ahead for better efficiencies.RV wholesale unit shipments of approximately 73,300 units decreased by 20% or more than 18,000 units from the third quarter of 2022. We currently estimate third quarter retail registrations were approximately 105,800 units, an estimated decline of approximately 13% compared to the third quarter of 2022. The metrics we have outlined imply a net decrease in dealer inventories of approximately 32,500 units during the quarter and approximately 78,000 units year-to-date.Our estimates indicate that the TTM dealer inventory weeks on hand at the end of the third quarter of 2023 have declined to approximately 12 to 14 weeks from 19 to 21 weeks at the beginning of fiscal 2023 and 16 to 18 weeks at the end of the second quarter of 2023. This is well below historical levels of approximately 26 to 30 weeks.From a model year mix perspective, as it relates to the current dealer inventory levels, we believe the ratio of prior model year units that currently sit on dealer lots reflects a more normal relationship compared to what we experienced over the first half of the year.For context, we estimate just 300,000 model year '23 units were built versus an estimated 650,000 model year '22 units. Our marine revenues, which represents 24% of our third quarter 2023 consolidated sales decreased 24% to $205 million on wholesale shipments that are estimated to have declined 23% in the quarter.We believe dealer inventory restocking reached an equilibrium toward the end of the quarter and marine OEMs and dealers are acting in a very disciplined manner as they manage the slower part of the selling season with model year inventory mix that appears close to normal.As noted, we estimate marine wholesale unit shipments were down 23% in the quarter to approximately 35,000 to 40,000 units on retail unit shipments that were up 1% to a range of 45,000 to 50,000 units. We estimate more than 20,000 units were taken out of inventory in the second quarter of 2023 and more than 10,000 units in the third quarter of 2023.Our estimated marine content per wholesale unit increased 3% and on a TTM basis to $5009 compared to the same period of 2022. We estimate overall dealer inventories are at approximately 20 to 22 weeks on hand at the end of the third quarter, decreasing from an estimated second quarter level of 23 to 25 weeks, historical averages weeks on hand approximated 35 to 40 weeks.Revenues in our housing market decreased 18% to $261 million and represented 30% of our consolidated sales. The housing side of our business is primarily tied to manufactured housing, single and multifamily housing with manufactured housing making up 56% of the total.MH estimated wholesale unit shipments were down 22% in the quarter while total residential housing starts for the third quarter decreased 6% and single-family starts increasing 7% and multifamily starts decreasing 28%.Our estimated MH content per unit increased 8% to $6,498 on a TTM basis compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of market share gains. Our team has continued to make consistent CPU gains as we collaborate with OEMs as they strive to exceed sustainability and energy efficiency guidelines.Manufactured homes continue to offer an accessible and cost-effective solution compared to the site-built homes, particularly in the face of the acute affordable housing shortage we are experiencing today.Further, we believe our housing businesses have significant long-term potential given the structural and supply-demand imbalances that continue to plug consumer searching for affordable housing alternatives.As noted, the overarching theme of higher interest rates is affecting both dealer floor plan costs and consumer monthly payments across our markets. We continue to be optimistic about the earning power of our business, especially given our past and present cost reduction initiatives and see interest rate stabilization as a potential tailwind.As we look at the opportunity landscape from new product introductions, market share gains and the scalability of our RV business to our highly engineered suite of products in our marine portfolio which includes both design capabilities to our portfolio of aftermarket solutions, we offer to a larger used boat market, we remain confident in our outdoor enthusiast business and their targeted future growth.We expect to continue to invest in these spaces and believe in the industry's long-term health. Additionally, our teams are constantly modeling future scenarios in our markets giving us the ability to react quickly to -- on our plans as markets and the economy dictate.Moving to our growth objectives. Our team remains focused on evaluating acquisitions in our current pipeline while adding potential targets for future consideration. These targets include businesses within our current end markets with similar product offerings, those that might be in adjacent markets and those that add new products and services to our portfolio.While we continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions, we also carefully consider larger acquisitions that align with our long-term vision and strategic objectives. We have a track record of identifying and integrating accretive acquisitions and continue to have a full pipeline of potential targets. Any acquisitions we complete will operate within our brand forward go-to-market strategy.Related to capital allocation, we continue to invest in our automation and innovation and efforts as we further refine our operational and production processes. An example of these investments is our expanded use of robotic solutions through robots as a service, which allows us to structure our capital spending more efficiently on targeted automation efforts while mitigating operational risk. We were impressed with the results from the initial autonomous robotic cell and its capabilities to complete multiple surface treatments on composite parts.We launched the first standing cell application in 2023 and are now implementing robots as a service cell across multiple business units. We will continue to expand our scalability and operational efficiencies and including through ongoing efforts to seek out and develop new solutions for a broad range of manufacturing capabilities.Our customer-focused brand-led go-to-market strategy extends to customization and collaboration as we work in partnership with our valued customers to build innovative and compelling products and solutions to improve the end customers' experience.As an example of this is the Harley-Davidson audio powered by Rockford Fosgate partnership. This partnership between two legendary brands cements Rockford as the leading provider of high-performance branded audio for Harley-Davidson enthusiasts.Our teams do a tremendous job of collaborative innovation and partnership with our customers while offering high-quality customization and full solutions product offering. As Andy noted, we are expanding our product innovation through Patrick's Advanced Products Evolution group, a team committed to enhancing the solutions we can offer to our valued customers.I'll now turn the call over to Matt, who will provide additional comments on our financial performance.Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. Our consolidated third quarter net sales decreased 22% or $246 million to $866 million, driven by a 20% decrease in RV shipments, a 23% decrease in marine shipments and a 22% decrease in manufactured housing shipments.Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 23%, which was the result of our strategic diversification, acquisitions, cost reduction initiatives, investments in automation and continuous improvement and operational efficiencies.Warehouse and delivery expenses declined $2 million to $38 million in Q3 2023, increasing 70 basis points as a percentage of sales due to lower revenue and partially due to acquisitions completed this year.SG&A expense declined $14 million or 17% to $71 million in the third quarter of 2023. SG&A increased 60 basis points as a percentage of sales on lower revenue. Additional factors included higher insurance, software and technology and nonrecurring reorganization expenses.Operating income decreased $22 million. Our operating margin remained resilient, decreasing just 10 basis points to 8.2%, driven by the previously described factors. Net income decreased 33% to $40 million, which equates to $1.81 per diluted share.Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million versus $131 million last year. However, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 13.1% for the third quarter of 2023.Our overall effective tax rate was 27% for the third quarter compared to 24.1% in the prior year. We continue to estimate our overall effective tax rate for 2023 to be approximately 25% to 26%.Looking at cash flows. Cash provided by operations for the first nine months of 2023 was approximately $294 million, an increase of $64 million or 28% compared to approximately $230 million in the prior year's period.As Andy noted, our solid financial results, coupled with our prudent balance sheet management has resulted in strong cash flow. This quarter, capital expenditures were $11 million, as Jeff noted, we continue to invest in our operations to drive innovation, efficiencies and long-term value for our customers and stakeholders.We continue to expect CapEx to range from $65 million to $70 million in 2023. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $115 million, implying free cash flow during the quarter of $105 million. For the trailing 12-month period, we generated $412 million of free cash flow compared to $250 million for the same period last year.We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. At the end of the third quarter, after paying down $112 million on our debt, including $110 million on our revolving credit facility, we had approximately $700 million of total net liquidity. Comprised of $17 million of cash on hand and unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $683 million.Total net leverage was 2.5 times. We continue to see the tangible results of our cost, balance sheet and financial management with no major debt maturities until 2027 and approximately $700 million of liquidity, we have a solid financial foundation to capitalize on opportunities and successfully navigate current and future market conditions.We returned $10 million in the form of dividends during the quarter. We remain opportunistic on share repurchases and have $84 million left authorized under our current plan at the end of the third quarter.Moving to our end market outlook. We continue to expect higher interest rates to negatively impact dealers' willingness to hold inventory during the fourth quarter. As Jeff discussed earlier, RV retail registrations have exceeded wholesale shipments during the quarter and the year-to-date period, implying a significant reduction in the number of units on dealer lots. This has been the result of continued discipline by OEMs and dealers and positions the industry favorably for 2024.Based on recent trends, we currently estimate full year RV retail registrations will be down approximately 15% to 17%, implying retail registrations of approximately 370,000 to 380,000 units. Assuming consistent dealer weeks on hand levels, as Jeff noted, this approximates based on our retail estimates full year 2023 RV wholesale unit shipments of 300,000 to 310,000 units, implying a decline of approximately 37% to 40% from 2022.For 2024, we currently estimate wholesale and retail unit shipments at 350,000 units.In our marine market, we estimate 2023 wholesale shipments will be down 15% to 17%. We continue to believe dealer inventories are calibrated. However, as noted, dealers are acting with an abundance of caution, given higher floor plan costs as we head into the winter.Retail has outperformed our expectations, and we currently estimate retail registrations will decline 5% to 10% and for 2023. For 2024, we currently estimate marine retail and wholesale will be down 15%.On the housing side of the business, we continue to expect MH wholesale shipments to be down 20% to 25% for 2023 with retail sales absorbing available wholesale production on a real-time basis.In our residential housing end market, we expect 2023 new housing starts will be down 10% to 15%. We currently expect the housing market to be flat in 2024 and that MH will be up 10%. We estimate our full year 2023 operating margin will be between 7.5% and 7.8% and continue to expect to generate operating cash in excess of $400 million this year as working capital lines of revenues, implying free cash flow of $330 million or more based on our CapEx estimates.That completes my remarks. We are now ready for questions.Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please proceed with your questions. Mr. Stember, perhaps your line is muted. Live for questions.Sorry about that. Yeah, I forgot where the mute button was. Sorry about that. Could you guys talk about apparently a little bit of a stalemate going on with dealers and OEMs, whether it's pricing on '24 product or dealers looking for some help on floor plan. Could you just maybe talk about what you're hearing. Has there been any movement on that front on the order process? And when would you expect that to start to break through a little bit?Yes, Scott, this is Jeff. Really coming out of Open House, we didn't expect a lot of orders immediately from the Open House, more of a planning between OEMs and dealers, how they wanted to spread their orders between the fourth quarter and getting into the selling season of the first quarter. So we've continued to see production levels pretty consistent through the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. We will see some shutdowns around Thanksgiving and Christmas, pretty traditional from what we've seen in the past. And we expect with the dealer inventory levels at the level that they are currently that we'll see some upside going into the first quarter based on their need to have product for the selling season. So I will tell you that the OEMs continue to remain disciplined with their production levels, which I think is managing the inventories out in the field and putting them in a really good position as we move forward.Got it. And then on the aftermarket side of the business, can you maybe talk about how that performed in the quarter, mainly in Marine, I suppose, and off-road vehicle and just talk about the prospects for next year, particularly if we are going into some form of a recession.Sure, Scott, this is Andy. I think that our aftermarket business was actually down just a little bit, which has been consistent with where it's been for a lot of the year. That being said, the margin profile on that business for us is very strong. And so it's performing a little bit better than our expectations as it relates to the margin, which is some of the benefit we've seen on that aftermarket side. So we're optimistic about it. I think, especially as you look at trends that we would expect as it relates to discipline and where this financing environment is at from a purchase of new units we certainly would expect to see the aftermarket play a more countercyclical role as it relates to the average user out there, upgrading their unit with aftermarket products. So we're optimistic about it. It's held up from our perspective. It's been -- I should say, it's been down a little bit, but held up from a margin perspective, which we feel really good about.Just last question, a lot of news about one of your top RV customers starting to do -- or starting to bring some functions in-house becoming more vertically integrated. Can you talk about how that would affect Patrick and just from a bigger picture, what we can expect from a content impact going forward?Sure. I think that as we look at our product portfolio out there, Scott, we've got, as we talked about, a little bit of a good, better, best product offering. We certainly expect to continue to partner with our customers. I like the innovation that we're seeing out there today just across the spectrum. And I think that's the push that we can get really excited about, especially with our advanced product evolution group and working with those customers to be able to develop products in partnership side by side with them. So we look at -- we have competition in all of our product categories, and we expect to be competitive in the product categories that we're in. So we still feel like we've got great partnerships with the OEMs in the space.Got it. That's all I have for now. I'll jump back into the queue.Thank you.The next question is from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for all the color. Maybe shift gears toward the margins. Gross margins are remarkably strong given the current level of demand. You expect to maintain those levels as we look to Q4 and into maybe H1 fiscal '24? Or are you seeing any pricing pressure work its way back to the supply chain at this stage?Yes. Dan, this is Andy. I think as it relates to the margins, we expect a little bit of choppiness in Q4. It typically is one of the softer quarters seasonally for us. And would expect just a little bit of choppiness as it relates to that, but that's built into our model. I think as we look at 1H 2024, we're still feeling like our margin profile is solid. The investments that we've made in automation without question are paying off. Our team has done a fabulous job of managing the labor force. And we've also sized the businesses according to the revenue stream that we're seeing today. So I think when we look across the spectrum in all of our businesses and we look at where the industries are at we feel like we've modeled the business to that platform and can flex up or down if we need to. But the leverageability going up for us will be solid. But I think as we look at our gross margins, a lot of the investments. The team has just done an absolutely fantastic job of managing the business, taking out costs, relying on the automation to generate throughput and efficiency and then continuous improvement initiatives that we've implemented across the spectrum continue to help drive those. So we're going to stay focused on that. And the goal would be to continue to, again, drive efficiencies and throughput and then really be able to leverage when we see the markets pick up.Excellent. And obviously -- great color on your outlook for each of the verticals as we look into next year. In terms of just cadence, do you expect much of a difference, if any, in terms of shipments, H1 to H2? Do you see things kind of slow -- starting out a little slower and then picking up in either of the three main businesses were relatively consistent across the year?I think what we expect is a more normal seasonality than we've seen in the past as it relates to production and retail. And I think when you kind of look at where inventory is at today, low, low level of weeks on hand, dealers being very, very thoughtful about the inventories that they're carrying. The OEs matched up to be able to produce. We would expect a more seasonal cadence. But again, like I said, I think we're balanced with what we see today as it relates to production levels and sized appropriately. So as we look at it, what I would tell you is we're watching retail certainly. But with the balance and the calibration that we see in the field today, between manufacturing, production and retail. We feel really good about the ability to flex across the spectrum.Excellent. Last one, I'll jump out. Free cash flow has been exceptional. Is there any more working capital left to unwind? Or should we expect it to be more neutral going forward, at least until demand starts to recover? Thank you.Yes. I think that from a working capital perspective, our team, again, has done an absolutely fantastic job of managing inventories in partnership with our customers. And I don't know that there's a ton of working capital to ring out. We do expect to be -- have over $400 million of operating cash at the end of this year, which is really in line with where our expectations were at. In fact, I think, as we look out into the future, one of the things that we're in a really advantageous position as it relates to the strength of our balance sheet in our liquidity is we're looking and saying, okay, if the manufacturing does go up, we want to make sure that we're positioned and we can be positioned with the appropriate levels of inventory when it does flex up. So we're talking to our OEM partners today about production and where their expectations are to make sure that we're positioned to be able to flex up if we need to add some working capital. So again, I think across the platform, our team has done a fabulous job of managing working capitalThank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Swartz with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just to start on the commentary around your outlook for the marine market for 2024. I think if I heard you right, you said you expect retail to be down 15%. I think that's one of the more bearish views I've heard, and I think that would put us right on the cusp of kind of the depth of great recession demand levels. So maybe just a little color on maybe how you're thinking about the year in Marine and maybe how you got to that number?Sure, Mike. This is Andy. I think as we look out, right now, we feel, again, that production and retail are very well aligned to kind of one for one. And we're being cautious. As we noted, marine retail has been stronger than we expected. So I would tell you that we're being cautious in modeling our business around that number. And we certainly think that there's some upside potential as you look at the numbers that are there, but we want to make sure that we're thoughtful, as I talked, our business is balanced as it relates to the revenue stream matched against our cost structure. And so as we look at Marine right now, production levels that we're seeing, tremendous discipline is what I would say in the space. So we're not concerned about over inventory or the ability to produce. We're just staying cautious as it relates to what it could look like in this environment and that's how we are building our model with upside potential to flex very easily in the event that shipments are better than that. So we've got a cautious outlook, but the caution is just simply around where we're centered today and the ability to flex up very quickly if we need to.Okay. That's perfect. And then just on -- with -- we've all heard the stories of where model year '24 pricing has gone in RV in some instances, down double digits in towables, there's a lot of talk about de-contenting to hit some of those price points. Maybe give us just a back drop of what you're seeing? And I guess, how much risk do you think the de-contenting dynamic presents to Patrick in terms of your content loads going forward?Yeah, Mike, this is Jeff. I think what we've really seen after the model change was not necessarily a lot of de-contenting, but the offering or bringing in smaller floor plans -- introductory floor plans and trying to hit that lower end of the market. We've seen a little bit more of that in the production levels over the last couple of months, really kind of the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So to that sense, it's not necessarily de-contenting as much as not as much content in some of the units that are being built on the smaller range. From a Patrick perspective, I believe, we're in pretty good shape with our content per unit, primarily because of the business we picked up and the market share we've been able to gain over the last 12 months. It's been pretty incredible what our team has done. They've gone out. Really pushed hard in that area and we've seen significant growth in the range of about $150 million over the last 12 months. So I think that's going to really offset anything that is in the lower end units, but we -- in our normal standard units, we haven't seen a ton of de-contenting. So we feel pretty good about where we stand today.And clarification, that $150 million is something that you anticipate going forward? Or is that something that's already been realized?Annualized.Okay. Perfect. And then just one more for me, if you will, just the typical breakout between M&A, share, price, and I think you said industry volume was off 22%. So that's easy.Yes. Mike, this is Matt filer. So the 22% revenue decrease that we saw in the quarter. As you mentioned, industry is down across our end markets, about 21%. Our net organic impact is down 3% and then acquisitions had a positive 2% impact. And if you break down that organic impact, pricing is down 5% and pure organic growth is up 2%.Awesome. Thank you so much.Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just hoping you could provide some color on how you're thinking about M&A in the current environment and valuations. Thanks.This is Andy. Yes. I think, again, as we talked about from a liquidity perspective and a leverage perspective, we feel really good about our positioning right now to be able to actively look at and evaluate acquisitions. Our pipeline continues to be full, both organically and we are getting deal flow. Deal flow has actually slowed down from external participants, but the deals that we're cultivating, which we are constantly doing on the organic side continue to be there. And as we look at valuations I would tell you that valuations are stable from our perspective. I think as we look at modeling where everybody -- where the disconnect today is that on a normalized run rate basis with valuation expectations is really kind of just the gap that's there today. But as we look at our model and we look at where we're at and the businesses that are attractive to us, we feel like we're in a really good position to be offensive if we want to here with the liquidity position that we've got and as well the leverage position. So we're going to take advantage of opportunities that pop up, but we are also actively cultivating acquisition targets as well.Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Many have been addressed already, but I wanted to circle back on content per unit. Came in a little above where we had anticipated, but I know it's an LTM metric. And I'm wondering, as you look into 2024, what's a reasonable expectation for content per unit in RV and marine specifically?Yes, Craig, this is Jeff. We feel like in through the fourth quarter and into the first part of the next year, our content per unit is going to remain relatively flat from where we are. There will be some pricing movement in a few areas, maybe down and some up. But certainly, some of the increased market share we've been able to gain is going to offset anything that we see in the pricing.And that flat as a comment relative to your Q3 experience?That's correct.Okay. Great. Thanks. And then again, looking at 2024, I know it's early, but just -- what are some of the puts and takes as you consider the margin profile of your business? And if you can comment on whether labor rates are at all impacted by some of the UAW contract or any other pressures that are facing that environment.Yes. Craig, I think as we look out into '24, again, we feel good about our cost structure today with where we're at. We actively partner with our customers from a pricing perspective as commodities move up and down and work very well with them in partnership from my perspective. So as we look at those, that component, the labor side of the business is very stable for us. We've got a great core group of labor, talent out there that is doing a fabulous job that is flexible and nimble. So we feel good about that. I think as we just look at the model today and where we're stabilized and looking out in the future and positioned. I think we look and say, okay, we're in a good spot. We can flex up very quickly and leverage off of that. And if we need to take some more cost out, we certainly can do that and we'll do that very prudently. So overall, as we look at the cost structure and the puts and takes, I feel like we can continue to be very flexible and nimble with our business model our team is just really good at that. And so I've been so impressed with what they've been able to do in the way that they proactively manage the business has been super invigorating from our perspective. So we feel like we can be flexible and nimble and flex with wherever volumes are at as we look at going forward. Obviously, there's macroeconomic concerns out there, but we are positioned very well to continue to flex.Great. Thank you.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Griffin Bryan with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.Yeah, thanks. Just one for me. So in terms of the enhanced dealer inventory for both marine and RV, do you think this returns to its historical norm or these current levels and new run rate going forward over the medium to long-term? Thanks.Griffin, we're planning our business around the current weeks on hand levels, which we believe are obviously very low given the interest rate environment and we certainly appreciate the prudence that both OEMs and dealers are using today to minimize floor plan financing costs. So from our perspective, we're at a low level of weeks on hand, lower than we would have anticipated. But it's been calibrated from our perspective. And so I think our modeling is centered around consistent weeks on hand. We're not planning anything up. If it does go up, then we would expect some restocking and we will certainly participate in flex with that. But right now, we're building our model off of consistent weeks on hand.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn it over to Andy for closing remarks.I want to end the call by once again expressing my sincere gratitude to our talented team members were the reason for our success. Their dedication and commitment are instrumental to Patrick continuing to be a customer-focused supplier that empowers enthusiasts on the road, on the water and at home. We find inspiration in the resilience displayed by our team despite the wide range of market and industry changes we've seen in the past few years. This resilience gives us the confidence that we can navigate any challenges that come our way and we will continue to utilize our operational and financial levers appropriately to drive sustainable growth and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. We thank everyone who has joined us on the call today.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-26T14:09:06.000-04:00
Newmont: Sitting At Trough Multiple Ahead Of Margin Recovery,"The Q2 Earnings Season wasn't nearly as strong as expected for the gold sector, and Newmont's () headline results were among the weakest sector-wide, with lower production, higher costs, and a significant decline in free cash flow. However, this isIn this update, we'll look at Newcrest's annual results and why this deal will be transformative for Newmont, especially when combined with the improving free cash flow generation for its legacy business.Newcrest released its FY2023 (June 2022 to June 2023) results last month, reporting annual production of ~2.11 million ounces of gold and ~133,100 tonnes of copper, an increase from ~1.96 million ounces of gold and ~120,700 tonnes of copper in the year-ago period. The higher production was related to a stronger year at Cadia and a full year of gold production from Brucejack, offset by lower production at Telfer, Lihir, and Red Chris. And despite minimal help from gold and copper prices (flat and down, respectively), Newcrest had a solid year financially, reporting revenue of ~$4.51 billion, operating cash flow of ~$1.61 billion and industry-leading all-in sustaining costs of $1,093/oz, up ~5% year-over-year, which was a much smaller rate of change than its peer group.Digging into the results a little closer, Cadia was the stand-out with ~596,900 ounces of gold produced at all-in sustaining costs [AISC] of $45/oz, making this one of the lowest-cost mines sector-wide next to Ernest Henry. This solid cost performance was despite higher sustaining capital in the period related to TSF construction, and it was despite a lower average realized copper price of $3.76/lb, resulting in lower by-product credits. Newcrest noted that the improved production was related to recovery improvements following the commissioning of the two-stage plant expansion project, and the company also approved the Cadia PC1-2 Feasibility Study, with first ore expected in FY2026. While costly at ~$1.2 billion, the project has a 23% IRR at $1,950/oz gold and extends the mine life well into the 2050s, making this one of the longest-life gold assets sector-wide.Unfortunately, the solid results at Cadia were overshadowed by a tough year the company's largest Lihir Mine in Papua New Guinea, which produced just ~670,000 ounces last year, down from ~687,000 ounces in FY2022. The lower production was related to lower feed grades, with a higher proportion of low-grade ex-pit material processed in H2 due to the impact of extreme rainfall which impeded pit access and affected material handling at the crushers. This softer H2 production was on top of an already tough H1 performance where mill throughput was impacted by drought conditions which limited water supply, in addition to lower mill availability due to unplanned downtime. Fortunately, 2024 will be a better year with high-grade ore from the recently approved Phase 14A cutback, and this will help to displace lower-grade stockpiles previously planned for feed during the transitional zone between the Lienits and Kapit Pit from FY2023 to FY2027.The result is a more consistent production profile with higher output overall with a steady trend higher in gold production going forward until FY2030. And like Cadia, returns are robust, with a 64% IRR even at a conservative $1,800/oz gold price assumption.Finally, in British Columbia, production was lower at the company's new Brucejack Mine, but costs still came in well below the industry average. Looking at the annual results, Brucejack produced ~286,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,157/oz despite a ~60% increase in sustaining capital in the period. Meanwhile, the mine generated ~$115 million in free cash flow despite lower production than planned. Unfortunately, Red Chris' results were weaker, with lower gold and copper production, a lower copper price and similar sustaining capital contributing to costs well above the industry average ($3,733/oz vs. $1,349/oz). Newcrest noted that recoveries were impacted by a shift to mining at the Main Zone (Phase 7) vs. East Zone which carries higher levels of pyrite. That said, the big picture at Red Chris has never been more bullish, with continued exploration success and a path to negative AISC later this decade with Red Chris Block Cave, and continued high-grade results from East Ridge and Far East Ridge.Moving over to costs and margins, Newcrest's assets performed well overall despite the headwind of lower by-product credits from a weaker copper price. This was helped by a weaker Canadian and Australian Dollar in the period, but also higher production at Cadia which had a massive year despite lower gold head grades. That said, Lihir's elevated costs (Newcrest's largest mine) pulled the company's consolidated costs higher to $1,093/oz (FY2022: $1,043/oz), resulting in AISC margins declining to $680/oz (FY2022: $732/oz). However, these margins still came in above the industry average for the period, and we should see better costs at Lihir next year (FY2023: $1,466/oz) assuming we don't see another year with multiple headwinds.Finally, from a financial standpoint, it may look like Newmont paid a lofty price for Newcrest considering that the company generated just ~$404 million in free cash flow year, given that Newmont is paying upwards of $18.0 billion for the company (45x trailing free cash flow). And while there's no disputing that it's paying a premium price, this is a portfolio that is not operating at anywhere near its full potential currently. This is because Lihir's production profile is well below life-of-mine production levels (~670,000 ounces vs. ~820,000 ounces) even ahead of potential upside from steep wall technologies and a simpler seepage barrier design, Red Chris is a money-losing asset currently, but it's a future ~300,000 ounce gold producer at negative ~$200/oz AISC from 2029-2035, and Havieron will also come online later this decade, a high-grade asset whose ore will be trucked to Telfer, with AISC expected to come in below $800/oz.Hence, this will be a very different looking group of assets from a free cash flow standpoint later this decade when Havieron and Red Chris Block Cave are online, Brucejack is further optimized and Lihir's production profile is above 1.0 million ounces per annum. Plus, this doesn't even count upside from East Ridge, Far East Ridge, and Wafi-Golpu, with Newcrest having a 50% ownership in the latter asset which could also be a negative AISC producer. So, while the price paid may look steep, it's hard to put a price on multiple assets with what look to be at least 25 year mine lives (Cadia, Havieron, Red Chris, Wafi Golpu) with all-in sustaining costs coming in between [-] $100/oz and ~$800/oz, miles below the current industry average. And with the ultra high-grade Golden Marmot discovery + new high-grade near mine discoveries (North Block, 1080 HBx zones) Brucejack should also see its costs improve further, with the potential for sub $1,000/oz AISC when combined with a planned increase in throughput (4,500+ tonnes per day), the potential to use ore sorting technology and further synergies.For those unfamiliar, highlight holes from North Block include 28.5 meters at 262 grams per tonne of gold (including 1.0 meter at 7,400 grams per tonne of gold), highlight holes at Golden Marmot include 20 meters at 187 grams per tonne of gold (including 0.50 meters at 6,700 grams per tonne of gold), and highlight holes at 1080 HBx include 18 meters at 306 grams per tonne of gold (including 1.0 meter at 5,370 grams per tonne of gold) and 38.5 meters at 49 grams per tonne of gold (including 1.0 meter at 1,735 grams per tonne of gold), and 10.5 meters at 918 grams per tonne of gold, among the highest-grade intercepts reported sector-wide from just one of Newcrest's many assets. Importantly, these are entirely separate from world-class intercepts coming from other assets in the portfolio like at Havieron (~150 meters at 3.7 grams per tonne of gold and 0.15% copper) and Red Chris (~248 meters at 1.6 grams per tonne of gold and 1.4% copper, or ~3.5 grams per tonne gold-equivalent).Assuming the successful amalgamation of Newcrest and Newmont, the company will extend its lead over the sector's largest gold producers with ~8.0 million ounces of annual gold production, ~380 million pounds of copper production (excluding significant growth from projects that include Red Chris Block Cave and 50% of Wafi-Golpu) and it will have multiple Tier-1 assets in its portfolio, defined as those with 500,000 GEOs of production per annum (100% basis), a 10+ year mine life, and costs in the lower end of the cost curve. These assets include Tanami, Turquoise Ridge (38.5%), Carlin (38.5%), Cortez (38.5%), Pueblo Viejo (40%), Lihir, Cadia, Boddington, and Penasquito. Plus, from a cost standpoint, Newmont is confident it can achieve $500 million in pre-tax synergies within two years of the deal closing (20% G&A, 40% supply chain helped by economies of scale, 40% Full Potential Continuous Improvement Program).Despite this path to Newmont solidifying itself as a larger and more diversified producer, many investors have avoided the stock because while it may be the largest gold producer, its margins have taken a beating over the past two years, as has its free cash flow generation. Its AISC margins evidence this, plummeting to $493/oz in its most recent quarter (Q2 2021: $788/oz), and quarterly free cash flow dropping 93% to $40 million (Q2 2021: $578 million) on a two-year basis. These stats are even more disappointing given that Newmont enjoyed a record average realized gold price of $1,965/oz in Q2 2023. That said, outside of inflationary pressures, there were several key differences from Q2 2023 vs. Q1 2021.For starters, capital expenditures were ~50% higher at $616 million with sustaining capital spend and higher growth capital expenditures. Elevated sustaining capital was related to camp upgrades at Musselwhite and the addition of five new autonomous haul trucks at Boddington. The latter (growth capital) was due to increased spending at Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Pamour, and the Cerro Negro District Expansions. Finally, the company got little help from its lower-cost Penasquito Mine in the period with mining activities halted in early June related to a strike, and also saw production curtailed at Cerro Negro (safety inspections) and Eleonore (evacuation because of wildfires). And while Penasquito may not be much help in Q3 and it looks like Q4 could be affected as well at this rate, Newmont should see higher grades at Subika Underground, Cerro Negro, and Tanami, and stronger production from Turquoise Ridge, Cortez, and Carlin in the second half, helping to improve consolidated AISC in H2.Plus, if we look further out to 2025, we should see a material decline in Newmont's all-in sustaining costs as the company benefits from:In addition, while Newmont (stand-alone basis) looks to be seeing trough margins with a steady trend higher beginning next year, Newcrest's operations are much lower cost, and there's a path to even lower costs across its portfolio. In fact, as highlighted earlier, Newcrest's AISC came in well below the industry average at $1,093/oz despite a tough year at its largest asset (Lihir), little help from copper prices which affected its by-product credits, underperformance from Brucejack because of a brief shutdown following a tragic fatality, and a very high cost year at Red Chris. However, if approved, Red Chris Block Cave could produce ~300,000 ounces of gold and ~80,000 tonnes per annum of copper from 2029 to 2034, with all-in sustaining costs expected to be deeply in negative territory even at sub $4.00/lb copper prices.So, while we will see lower costs immediately for Newmont if the Newcrest deal is approved, the medium-term and long-term benefits are also significant, with low-cost projects like Havieron (70%) and Red Chris Block Cave (70%) paving a path towards sub $1,000/oz AISC and the potential for even lower AISC if Wafi-Golpu (50%) is developed (another asset that's expected to have negative AISC). To summarize, with a larger production profile, more Tier-1 assets, greater diversification and the ability to optimize the portfolio by selling non-performing assets, I would expect Newmont to enjoy multiple expansion over the next two years and a much higher share price with a complete 180 in sentiment once investors get used to significantly higher free cash flow generation and a return to ~$750/oz AISC margins (~$1,200/oz AISC) vs. the much higher cost profile currently ($1,424/oz AISC year-to-date).Newmont remains out of favor today with the Penasquito strike extending longer than some had hoped, a rough H1 2023, and what might seem like a never-ending trend in higher costs, all combined with a dearth in free cash flow generation for a ~$30 billion company. However, digging into the results, it's clear that much better days are ahead, with significant progress on lower-cost projects (Tanami 2, Ahafo North), a better H2 on deck, and a transformative acquisition that will help with a steady decline in AISC short-term, medium-term, and long-term, especially if key projects like Red Chris Block Cave are green-lighted and the company does a solid job optimizing its portfolio. Hence, with the stock in the penalty box and trading near multi-year lows, I see this as an even better buying opportunity than September 2022, with high-margin projects closer to completion, the dividend cut out of the way, and a more robust development pipeline if the deal goes through.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Harley-Davidson Appears To Be A Value Trap,"Shares of Harley-Davidson () have been a poor performer over the past year, losing 16% of their value, continuing what has been a long period of poor performance. Shares have lost over half of their value in theOver the past , Harley's revenue has fallen by about 2% while operating income is about 18% lower than a decade ago. As prices have risen over the past decade, volumes have been steadily declining, and given rising wagesIf we begin by looking at the company's  results, it earned $1.22, down 16% from last year as total revenue fell by 2% to $1.45 billion. Motorcycle revenue fell by 4%, partially offset by a rise in financing revenue. Motorcycle operating income fell by 8% to $194 million as margins contracted 60bp to 16.2%.In Q2, volumes were down 10% and prices up 4%, which was not enough to offset rising labor costs. Notably, gross margins for bikes rose by 390bp to 34.8% as commodity input cost pressures have abated, but this was offset by higher operating expenses.It is important to note that HOG generates revenue by making and selling motorcycles to sell to its dealers. When the dealer buys the product, HOG books the revenue, not when the dealer goes on to sell it to a customer. During the quarter, Harley had unplanned production outages, which is a major reason its volumes declined - this is the second year in a row the company faced production issues, which does open questions about quality control of its operations.While this outage led to the drop in deliveries to dealer blamed for the revenue decline, I am not certain HOG really under-delivered relative to end customer demand. Now, retail sales were up 3% in Q2 - seven percentage points better than Harley's revenue. This sales growth and retail outperformance is a good thing to see, unquestionably. That said, inventories at Harley's dealers have been rising and are probably now at an appropriate level, even after this retail sales outperformance. Harley dealers are currently carrying 52,000 units.This is up dramatically from 2022 inventory of 27,000. Now like automobiles, motorcycle supply chains were significantly stressed during COVID, leading to production problems and product shortages. That 27k level was too low. I am not certain 52k is though. Admittedly, dealers were carrying 73,000 units in 2019. Looking at that metric, Harley could further increase deliveries to dealers, providing further revenue opportunities.However, when there is too much inventory for demand, pricing concessions can become necessary in order to move products to create space for newer models. This was a challenge HOG faced during the 2010s as sales were falling. Pricing is the best way to measure inventory levels relative to demand; if prices are rising substantially, inventories are likely too low. Well, prices rose just 4% over the past year, broadly in line with . That does not appear to point to a lack of inventory. aims for its bikes to sell within 2% of MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price), when dealers are selling above MSRP, that points to them holding too little inventory, but when prices fall below MSRP, that can cheapen the brand, make customers trained to wait for promotions, and points to too much inventory. Last quarter, HOG was seeing transactions occurring in this 2% band. This makes me skeptical that HOG will be able to meaningfully ""catch up"" on revenue and volumes lost during its shortage because its dealers appear not to really need that much more inventory than they currently carry. Higher rates and inflation have also caused affordability and demand challenges, according to management, so this is unlikely to change in coming quarters. This means deliveries should largely be consistent with consumer demand trends.Post COVID, Harley has been able to regain some margin by reversing its history of overstocking dealers with inventory. It will be important for them to retain their discipline. Particularly as the company has struggled to grow beyond its existing customer base which limits potential volume growth, maximizing profit per bike sold is critical to generating as much value as possible for shareholders. When we get Q3 earnings later this month, I will be closely watching dealer inventory levels, as I will be concerned if we see them marching much higher than the current 52k level as a sign that HOG is  relative to end consumer demand.This is particularly important because HOG's secondary source of profitability is now declining: its financing unit. Harley-Davidson has a captive finance arm, which provides loans to buyers of its motorcycles. During the second quarter, its financing segment saw revenue rise by $38 million as it has been able to pass on higher interest rates to customers. Receivables also rose by 6% to $7 billion as stretched affordability has led more buyers to take on loans when making a purchase. However, this was offset by a $38 million increase in interest expense.HOG borrows in the capital markets, via an asset-backed lending facility and through the issuance of medium-term notes to finance its bike loans. With this 1:1 interest expense to revenue increase, HOG has essentially been interest rate neutral.That said, its credit loss provisions nearly doubled to $57 million. Currently, Harley's Financial Services has set aside $352 million for credit losses. Just as we have seen from banks and credit card issuers, Harley has seen a rise in delinquencies and credit losses from 2021-2022. Much of this increase was to be expected as the benefits of government stimulus wore off and consumers spent down their excess savings. While I am comfortable with some decrease in credit quality, I am a bit concerned to see credit losses now running substantially higher than 2019 levels.Now, HOG is also reserving more than it did in 2019 in response to this, so these higher losses may already be accounted for, but I will want to see signs of credit losses stabilizing this quarter and beyond to feel comfortable that credit losses will not continue to rise. As it is, management expects operating income from financial services to decline 25% from last year.I also think it is important to recognize captive finance units are not always run to maximize their own profitability; instead, they are sometimes used to help support the underlying manufacturing business' profits. In other words, in the face of weaker demand, rather than cut prices, HOG may offer lower interest rates to effectively reduce the cost of a bike. Similarly, it may loosen credit standards somewhat to move sales, at the risk of having larger credit losses down the road, as we are seeing now.Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing, by using the financing arm to smooth through fluctuations in demand, volumes can be steadier, the brand damage of excess promotion can be avoided, and production levels can be maintained at more cost-efficient levels. Given management has spoken about affordability challenges and we are already seeing delinquencies rise, some of this may be occurring. As such, I see risks skewed to interest revenue rising more slowly than interest expense in coming quarters and that losses persist at somewhat higher levels. These are metrics investors should continue to monitor.Finally, HOG is trying to grow into electric motorcycles, an effort that has not been particularly successful yet. Its ""Livewire"" electric motorcycle unit is progressing slowly with revenue of just $7 million and a $32 million operating loss. It aims to deliver 600-1,000 units this year and lose $115-125 million, though production challenges have pushed out product launches. Its new Del Mar has a price point of just above $15k as Harley tries to reach a broader swathe of consumers.As with legacy automakers, the question is whether Harley will be able to recoup its investment in electrification, though given regulatory efforts to move away from fossil fuels, some of this investment may be necessary, even if it does not generate a particularly high ROI. While there is no data one way or the other, I struggle to believe there are large numbers of consumers who would be buying Harleys except for the fact they use gasoline. As such, I tend to think eventually EV sales will be more likely to cannibalize traditional sales rather than meaningfully grow HOG's addressable market.Looking at the balance sheet, it appears HOG carries $1.5 billion in cash and $5.8 billion in debt, but it is important to exclude its financing arm when looking at these figures as that debt is offset by loan receivables. Its motorcycle arm has $1.06 billion of cash against $750 million in debt. Now, about $250 million of its cash is supporting its cash-burning Livewire business, providing about a two-to-three-year runway to get to breakeven.Accordingly, its legacy business has essentially a $0 net debt position, which is appropriate given the cyclicality and capital intensity of the business and is consistent with how automakers like General Motors () and Ford () have run their business. HOG has a healthy balance sheet, which enables it to return free cash flow to shareholders, though I would not support debt-financed returns given the cyclical cash flows and uncertain path for revenue growth.Recently, management added  to its repurchase authorization (about 7% of the company), a sign of confidence in ongoing free cash flow. Still, I must note that the share count is down by about one-third over the past decade, and that has done little to support the share price. Indeed with most of these purchases coming at higher levels, the efficacy of this capital return is questionable.Last quarter, management guided to full year motorcycle revenue flat to up 3% with about a 14.1% operating margin while financial services would see operating income down about 25%. I see downside risks relative to this guidance, and I believe investors should be paying close attention to the interplay between sales and margins/financing income. To what extent is management trying to keep volumes up, even at the risk of eroding per unit profits is a key question.HOG has been for a prolonged period a ""melting ice cube"" business, one that generates cash, which it can return to investors, while seeing a gradual decline. Below, I provide three valuation scenarios: where free cash flow falls at 5% year as volumes continue to struggle, weighing on margins as seen last decade, one where free cash flow is flat, and one where free cash flow rise 2% year, discounted back to the present at 10%. I then have a terminal valuation of 15% free cash flow given the high cyclicality in the business and long-term growth questions, though markets may have a more discounted valuation in the first scenario and a more premium valuation in the third scenario.At $30, shares are essentially pricing in a very small, persistent free cash flow decline. In the long term, I struggle to see this business generating more than 2% growth. Per the Fed, long-term nominal  is about 3.8%. Given its difficulty winning over younger customers, it is hard to see this business growing as quickly as the overall economy. One also has to question is Harley should be willing to lose $100 million/yr on its electrification efforts, which are generating minimal revenue, when that extra free cash flow may be better returned to shareholders to provide more value as the business declines.While its 6.5x multiple looks cheap, HOG appears to be more of a value trap than value opportunity. I am not seeing signs that HOG has the demand to grow output and sustain margins while there is a risk financing profitability falls to support manufacturing output. Particularly as I see risks, with higher rates and inflation squeezing affordability of management having to reduce guidance when it reports earnings, I would avoid shares. I expect them to remain stuck in the $26-$31 zone of the -5% growth and flat growth scenarios. Downside is likely limited to 10-13% from here, but I struggle to see upside catalysts and believe investors would be better off investing elsewhere as Harley's long-term underperformance shows no signs of reversing.

September credit card metrics roughly reach prepandemic levels - What's ahead?,"Overall, credit card delinquency rates rose for lenders in September, while their net charge-off rates declined from August, according to data compiled by Seeking Alpha.Looking further back, the average delinquency rate of seven card issuers was about the same asLooking even further back, credit metrics stand roughly level with prepandemic readings. The banks that are exhibiting stronger readings on both delinquency and net charge-offs than before the pandemic are: American Express (), JPMorgan Chase (), Citigroup (), and Bank of America ().Looking ahead, some of the credit card issuers discussed their expectations for credit quality during their Q3 earnings call. Following are some excerpts:""Our delinquencies are the best leading indicator of domestic card credit performance, and the pace of delinquency rate normalization is slowing,"" () Chairman and CEO Richard Fairbank.""[For] the months of August and September, the month-over-month movement is getting really close to just the normal seasonal trend. And so this is one of the early indications that the trend of normalization we've been seeing may be stabilizing,"" he added.But Fairbank was careful to say that the trend may not continue. ""We happen to see some pretty positive things here, but they can also be a head fake and not be as good as they appear.""For American Express (), credit card delinquency and write-off rates have stayed relatively flat during the quarter, . Going forward, ""we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, and they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.""JPMorgan Chase () to rise to 2.5%, mostly due to recent balanced growth, said CFO Jeremy Barnum during the company's Q3 earnings call.While Discover () doesn't report the last month of the quarter separately until the following month, its Q3 total net charge-offs were 3.52% up 30 basis points from Q2 and 181 points higher than a year ago. In its card business, ""we continue to see the effects of seasoning of newer accounts, which have higher delinquency rates than older vintages,""  ""Losses remained consistent with targeted ranges.

Hess Midstream: An 8.3% Dividend Yield Is A Gift For Value Investors,"Hess Midstream () has demonstrated stellar financial performance over the past decade, with revenue compounding double-digits and profitability metrics expanding notably. A stellar free cash flow margin lets the company prioritize shareholder returns with a solid dividend payoutHess Midstream is an energy infrastructure company that owns, operates, develops, and acquires diverse midstream assets and provides fee-based services to Hess Corporation () and third-party customers.The company's fiscal year ends on December 31. HESM conducts business through three operating segments: Gathering, Processing & Storage [P&S], and Terminaling & Export [T&E]. According to the The company's financial performance has been solid over the past decade, with revenue compounding at about 19% per annum. Profitability metrics are also expanding, with the operating margin at a stellar 62% in the latest fiscal year. The company has generated a massive free cash flow [FCF] margin in the last two fiscal years.Having strong profitability metrics enables the company to sustain a shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach with consistent dividend payouts and share buybacks. On the other hand, I cannot say that the balance sheet is strong. Financial leverage is substantial, and liquidity metrics are lower than one, the level which is considered to indicate a solid liquidity position.The latest quarter's earnings were released on July 26, when the company topped consensus estimates on revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 3.4% YoY, and the adjusted EPS was flat at $0.50. Despite revenue growth, profitability metrics shrank slightly. During the , the management expressed their confidence in the company's near-term prospects and upgraded full-year guidance.The upcoming quarter's earnings release is scheduled for October 27. Quarterly revenue is expected by consensus at $345 million, indicating slightly below 3% YoY growth. The adjusted EPS is expected to be flat at $0.53.I like the dynamic of HESM's financial performance. The business demonstrates solid revenue growth and stellar profitability metrics. Dividend increases and substantial share buybacks are also suitable for investors. I consider the company's approach to financial leverage as risky, but the company has a strong track record of success and business expansion with substantial indebtedness in recent years. According to the company's latest 10-K report, HESM has long-term agreements with its affiliate, HES, with clauses including minimum volume commitments, inflation escalators, and fee recalculation mechanisms. I think all these agreements' terms are favorable for HESM and will provide the company with cash flow stability, growth, and downside risk protection. Since HESM is a related party to HES, the company does not face competition for the volumes from its sole customer. That said, to understand HESM's future growth prospects, we need to look at what consensus estimates forecasts for the customer's revenue for the next decade.As we see above, consensus estimates forecast HES's revenue to double over the next decade. I think this assumption is fair, given the area where HES operates. North Dakota is the U.S.'s third-largest oil production state, after Texas and New Mexico. The state also has almost  of U.S. natural gas resources, which is massive. It is important to emphasize that HES and HESM operate in the relatively young and promising Bakken formation in the Williston Basin. As we see from the latest EIA's Bakken region drilling productivity , we see that per-rig production volumes continue to grow and there is still room for improvement to pre-pandemic levels. That said, I expect volumes for HESM to continue growth in the next several years. Given the nature of HESM's favorable terms with HES related to inflation and fee upward adjustments, maintaining HESM's productivity capacity becomes the cornerstone for the company's future success. As the oil formation itself is still young and expanding production levels, I think that the trend is favorable for HESM. That said, the company needs to focus on addressing the highly likely increase in demand for its services with the planned expansion of the operating capacity. The management understands this and takes steps to improve the company's operating capacity. The company has a capital investment program through 2025 focused on well connects, targeted gas compression, and system optimization. Given the company's historical dynamic of Capex expenditure compared to revenue growth, I consider the management very efficient in the capacity expansion. Over the next two years, the management expects CAPEX to be stable as well. With stable Capex, increasing volumes and fees with downside protection, HESM's management  non-GAAP EBITDA and the adjusted FCF by 10% each year in the next two years. Considering all the tailwinds above and the management's strong track record, I consider the dividend growth safe.This year, the stock significantly underperformed the broad market with a 2.6% share price decline. HESM has a decent ""B+"" valuation grade from , though some of the multiples look substantially high.HESM has a solid dividend payout history. Therefore, I continue my valuation analysis with the dividend discount model [DDM].  suggests the company's WACC is 8%. Dividend  forecast a $2.59 payout in FY 2024. I use a conservative 3%  assumption.From the DDM perspective, the stock's fair price is about $52. The stock looks massively undervalued, with almost 80% upside potential. Let me move on to the discounted cash flow [DCF] approach. I will use the same 8% WACC as a discount rate. I have  for the upcoming three fiscal years and project a 3% revenue CAGR for the years beyond. I implemented a fixed 17.8% FCF margin, the last five years' average.According to the DCF simulation, HESM is also attractively valued with a 71% upside potential, even with net debt eliminated. To sum up, the stock looks attractively valued.Hess Midstream faces significant concentration risks because revenue is generated from its sole customer, the affiliated entity Hess Corporation. Any disruptions experienced by Hess Corporation could lead to a decline in revenue for HESM. Commercial agreements with Hess Corporation include provisions that permit Hess to suspend or terminate its obligations under the applicable agreement if certain events occur. HES has the ability to make such decisions, notwithstanding the fact that they may significantly and adversely affect HESM.Another major risk for the company is its significant indebtedness, meaning that a substantial portion of its profit is dedicated to servicing debt obligations. This restricts HESM's financial flexibility and limits its ability to invest in growth opportunities. A high level of indebtedness also might adversely affect the company's credit rating, potentially limiting access to capital markets or raising future borrowing costs.Midstream business is inherently capital intensive, meaning the company has to invest substantial amounts in capex. These investments are necessary to maintain and upgrade the company's operating capacity. The need to allocate substantial resources to servicing debt and capex can limit available funds to distribute to shareholders or pursue growth opportunities. Complex capital-intensive projects also expose HESM to the risks inherent to large projects, including budget overruns, delays in launch, and technical challenges.To conclude, HESM is a ""Buy"". I think the current valuation and stellar dividend yield provide an excellent investment opportunity for investors seeking for deep value. The company's solid financial performance and wide profitability metrics give me high confidence in dividend growth sustainability. I believe that the benefits of investing in HESM outweigh all risks and uncertainties.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Black Stone Minerals: Preferred Unit Distribution May Be Adjusted Above 10%,"Black Stone Minerals () primarily produces natural gas and is also partially hedged for 2024, but it should still benefit a bit from improved oil prices. I now project Black Stone's 2024 distributable cash flow at $1.81 per unit that Black Stone can maintain its current common unit distribution, which is $0.475 per quarter or $1.90 per year. However, its preferred units may now see their distribution rate adjusted to 10+% in November 2023, potentially leading Black Stone to work on at least a partial redemption of those units in late 2025 to early 2026. This is something to keep an eye on in the future.Black Stone has 14,711,219 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units outstanding with a par value of $300 million. These  have a 7% distribution rate currently, resulting in $21 million per year in preferred distributions. However, the preferred units will see their  on November 28, 2023 to the greater of its current distribution rate and the 10-year Treasury Rate + 5.5%.The potential challenge for Black Stone is that the 10-year Treasury Rate is currently the highest it has been since 2007. This would result in the preferred units (at the current 4.61% 10-year Treasury Rate) ending up with a 10.11% distribution rate, leading to $30.33 million per year in preferred distributions.While the distribution rate gets re-determined every two years, the formula calls for the new distribution rate to be the greater of the current distribution rate and the 10-year Treasury Rate + 5.5%. Thus, if the distribution rate changes to 10.11% in November 2023, that becomes the new floor for the distribution rate going forward.The Series B preferred units may be converted by holders into common units on a one-for-one basis, which results in an effective price of $20.3926 per unit. Black Stone's common units are trading around 14% below that price currently.Black Stone also has the ability to redeem the Series B units at 105% of par value during a 90-day period beginning November 28, 2023. It may later redeem the Series B units at 100% of par during a 90-day period beginning November 28, 2025.The interest rate for Black Stone's credit facility appears to be around 7.8% to 8.8% currently, depending on borrowing base utilization. Thus, it appears to make more sense financially for Black Stone to wait until November 2025 to potentially redeem at least some of its Series B units at par, rather than pay a 5% premium in a couple of months.Oil prices have improved a decent amount since I last looked at Black Stone, with the 2024 WTI oil strip up approximately $5.50 to $82.50 per barrel. This adds approximately $21.5 million to Black Stone's unhedged revenues for 2024.The 2024 Henry Hub strip has gone down slightly by $0.10 per Mcf over that same time frame, reducing Black Stone's unhedged revenues by approximately $6 million.Black Stone has around 46% of its 2024 oil production hedged, and the value of its 2024 oil hedges has decreased by another $10 million. Around 67% of Black Stone's 2024 natural gas production has been hedged, and those hedges have gained around $4 million in value.I now project Black Stone's distributable cash flow at $1.81 per unit for 2024, resulting in 0.95x distribution coverage at its current $0.475 per unit quarterly distribution.This assumes the production of 38,300 BOEPD (72% natural gas in 2024) for Black Stone.Looking forward to 2025, it appears that Black Stone's distributable cash flow could improve due to higher natural gas prices and a lack of below-market value hedges.The current strip for 2025 is approximately $76 WTI oil and $3.95 Henry Hub natural gas. Black Stone currently does not have any 2025 hedges. If Black Stone's production remains at 2024 levels, the improved natural gas prices in 2025 more than offsets the impact of weaker oil prices.Thus, at current 2025 strip and flat production growth, Black Stone is projected to generate $1.94 per unit in distributable cash flow in 2025, resulting in 1.02x distribution coverage at a $0.475 per unit quarterly distribution.I continue to believe that Black Stone is likely to maintain its quarterly distribution at $0.475 per unit based on current strip prices. However, Black Stone may want to redeem some of its Series B preferred units in late 2025 to early 2026. In that case, it may aim for a higher distribution coverage at some point to allow it to fund part of that redemption with cash on hand or to help pay down the credit facility debt from the redemption.My estimated value for Black Stone remains at $18.50 to $19.00 per unit at long-term (after 2024) $75 WTI oil and $3.75 Henry Hub gas, although Black Stone's decision on how to deal with its Series B preferred units may affect its estimated value.Black Stone Minerals is benefiting from improved oil prices, boosting its projected 2024 distributable cash flow to $1.81 per unit at 38,300 BOEPD in production and current strip. This would increase to $1.94 per unit in 2025 at the same production level and 2025 strip prices.Black Stone had zero credit facility debt and $47 million in cash on hand at the end of Q2, 2023, so it appears capable of maintaining its current $1.90 per unit annual distribution rate for its common units.The distribution rate for its preferred units may potentially be adjusted to 10+% in November 2023 though, which would likely prompt Black Stone to consider redeeming at least part of its $300 million in Series B preferred units in late 2025 to early 2026, when it can redeem those units at par though.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Sandstorm Gold Royalties: Recent Developments Upgrade Investment Thesis,"Just over a month ago,   (), noting that the company continued to be one of the most attractively valued names sector-wide. Since then, the stock has struggled to make upside progress, but has significantly outperformedIn my view, this outperformance is akin to a beachball being held underwater with the weight of the sector weighing on the stock, with multiple positive developments over the past several months that should have already catapulted the stock back above US$6.00 per share. In this update, we'll take a quick look at the recent Q2 results and recent developments which have upgraded the investment thesis.Sandstorm Gold reported  earlier this month, with record revenue of $49.8 million, attributable gold-equivalent ounces [GEOs] of ~24,500, and $38.0 million in operating cash flow with exceptional margins of $1,744/oz. The company has reiterated that debt paydown remains its focus, though it took advantage of weakness in the quarter to repurchase 2.8 million shares for approximately ~$5.07 per share. This solid performance was driven by a large and more diversified portfolio following the acquisition of Nomad and Basecore last year, with new contributions from Antamina (~1,800 GEOs), Caserones (~1,600 GEOs), Blyvoor (~700 GEOs), Bonikro (~1,500 GEOs). We also saw higher production year-over-year from legacy assets like Fruta del Norte and Aurizona, offseting dips in production at assets like Cerro Moro and Chapada which were up against tougher year-over-year comparisons.In addition to the larger portfolio and increased diversification shown in the above chart from these new assets that have begun contributing, Sandstorm benefited from a record average realized gold price, helping to offset a pullback in copper prices and zinc vs. the year-ago period. However, while the quarterly results are important and it's nice to see margins and revenue trending in the right direction, the more important figure to watch for royalty/streaming companies is developments across the portfolio which will ultimately contribute to future production and growth and sustain a royalty/streaming company's portfolio for the next decade or two. Fortunately, in Sandstorm's case, its weighted average mine life is much higher with exposure to several large-scale assets (Antamina, Caserones, Chapada) and its development portfolio offers similar long-life quality with key assets in Robertson, Greenstone, Platreef, and Hod Maden, in addition to further out opportunities like MARA, Hugo North Extension and potentially Lobo-Marte).Let's take a closer look at some recent developments below:Beginning with positive developments, there have been several over the past quarter, with Equinox () continuing to make progress at Greenstone (where Sandstorm holds a gold stream) which will pour first  within 12 months. Notably, the project remains on budget and schedule thanks to help from an all-star team in G Mining Services. Elsewhere, Blackwater (0.21% NSR held by Sandstorm on portion of pit) has reiterated an H2-2024 gold pour despite a minor delay due to wildfires as well, a positive development if it's expected to be a smaller contributor. And of course we can't forget SSR Mining's option to take a majority stake in Hod Maden which de-risked this asset and put it on course for 2027 production with a well-financed operator with Turkiye experience set to take over the reins. However, arguably the biggest news was Glencore's () decision to take full ownership of MARA in a $475 million deal (in addition to a royalty), increasing its ownership from 25% three years when the JV was established to 100%.The unsung beneficiary of this deal is Sandstorm Gold, which has an option from several years ago to convert its 0.25% NSR royalty at  into a 20% gold stream at ongoing payments equal to 30% of the spot price of gold. And with Glencore taking full ownership of  with Newmont () and Pan American () selling out and a 4-year construction period, this is an asset that now looks like it could start producing by 2029 given that I don't imagine Glencore would have rushed to buy out the minority and major partner's stakes if it had no interest in developing MARA in a timely manner. Plus, the attractiveness of  is one of the best copper assets globally on grade and scale is that it benefits from lower capex risk because of the benefit of existing infrastructure (concentrator plant, tailings dam with 7 years of capacity + the exhausted Alumbrera open pit for in-pit tailings disposal), and a concentrator transportation system.As the chart above highlights, MARA is expected to be a cash flow machine, and will produce 500+ million copper-equivalent pounds from copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum, with its gold production expected to average ~130,000 ounces over the first six years. This is a huge deal for Sandstorm which can lock up a 20% gold stream, and importantly the payments are staged if Glencore elects to move the project forward, meaning that Sandstorm doesn't have to suddenly come up with the $225 million payment all at once, meaning it can use cash flow from assets set to come online and its existing portfolio to help pay for this, as well as room on its revolver ($168 million at quarter-end ahead of its focus on debt paydown). For those wondering how significant this is to Sandstorm, MARA would provide attributable production to Sandstorm of ~26,000 ounces on average in Year 1 through 6 at a cost of just ~$570/oz assuming a $1,900/oz gold price.As I've discussed in past updates, this was one reason  was so undervalued and the extreme negative sentiment seemed overdone because its peak guidance of ~125,000 GEOs did not include , did not include Platreef expansions (Phase 2 and 3), did not include Heruga and Hugo North Extension at Oyu Tolgoi, and didn't include any upside from Blyvoor where estimates appear to have been throttled back for this asset's long-term production profile. Plus, no upside was being allotted to smaller assets that could contribute over the next decade like Woodlawn, North Telfer, Gualcamayo DCP ($30 million payment on commercial production & 1.5% NSR), Bayan Khundii, or Lobo-Marte.This is important because if we look at just the major assets set to come online in addition to  (pink bar),  had the potential to add ~90,000 GEOs per annum in addition to its existing attributable production profile from these assets in 2029/2030 near peak production (Hod Maden, Platreef Phase 2, Greenstone, Robertson).Finally, while not as significant as a development as the move to better capitalized operators at MARA (Glencore) and Hod Maden with SSR Mining (), we saw positive commentary regarding Hounde during Endeavour Mining's () Q2 2023 Conference Call, where Sandstorm holds a 2.0% NSR. For those unfamiliar, this is a very high-margin asset and one of Endeavour's largest mines in Burkina Faso, with the mine producing ~295,000 ounces at $809/oz last year. As noted in Endeavour's recent earnings release, drilling below the Vindaloo deposit  This has opened up the potential for a high-grade underground resource at Vindaloo Deeps, a positive for an asset that has continued to deliver for Sandstorm with impressive reserve replacement, suggesting this asset could produce well into the 2030s (current M&I resource is ~4.7 million ounces).Elsewhere, in Ecuador, Lundin Gold () reported more solid step-out drill results at Fruta del Norte South (""FDNS"") and Bonza Sur, including 7.1 meters at 11.54 grams per tonne of gold, 5.1 meters at 7.59 grams per tonne of gold, and 8.8 meters at 4.53 grams per tonne of gold. These point to resource expansion potential and appear to have identified a series of subparallel mineralized veins at FDNS that show similar hydrothermal alternation to Fruta del Norte, a 5.0 million ounce reserve base at ~8.7 grams per tonne of gold. Meanwhile, drilling at Bonza Sur is following up on a promising geochemical anomaly. So, with Sandstorm having a 0.90% NSR on the district that is now seeing its most aggressive exploration program since the Aurelian Resources days, the mine life extension potential here looks promising (giving investors great visibility into future contributions to Sandstorm), and Sandstorm represents an inexpensive way to get exposure to a possible new discovery in this district.There's no shortage of criticism of the Sandstorm investment thesis, with worries from the viability of the Mercedes Mine where Sandstorm holds gold and silver streams (given its high operating costs), the company's debt levels, and some critics have even highlighted legal challenges as a potential reason for uncertainty. While I discussed the risks to the thesis in great detail in past updates, I will briefly address some recent concerns below:Beginning with the most insignificant of these risks, which is $8 million in severance claims that remain outstanding (which Sandstorm believes are without merit) related to former employees of Colossus Minerals (where Sandstorm held a stream), this is hardly a cause for uncertainty. For starters, $8 million is a trivial amount to Sandstorm, even if the courts decided in the third party's favor, and the company has disclosed these claims as far back as its 2019 Annual Report, so this is hardly some new development that's suddenly sprung up. On the point of Mercedes where Sandstorm holds gold and silver streams, there's no question that this asset hasn't delivered as expected under Equinox or Bear Creek Mining (), and Q1 sales of ~12,500 ounces at $1,670/oz AISC certainly doesn't inspire much confidence. However, to call this a key asset is a stretch, with this asset making up less than 4% of NAV. Plus, AISC will look much worse when an asset is producing well below its planned production levels (~12,000 ounces per quarter vs. ~17,500 ounce quarterly implied production based on guidance), with Q1 affected by what was already planned lower grades, exacerbated by development delays because of contractor equipment availability. So, with feed grades well below the reserve grade (2.91 grams per tonne of gold vs. 3.75 grams per tonne of gold), it's not surprising that Q1 was an ugly quarter for Bear Creek.However, Bear Creek noted it has implemented more productive mining methods since Q1 with a switch to room and pillar mining at San Martin and sub-level caving and sub-level stopping at Mariana. This should result in less dilution, and we've already seen a significant tick up in developments rates in Q2 (30% better than Q1 at 1,353 meters) to set up a better second half of the year for the asset. Finally, mining rates are expected to double in the much higher-grade San Martin deposit once more faces are available, with grades here over 80% above the reserve grade at ~6.6 grams per tonne of gold. Hence, I don't believe the underperformance of Mercedes in the most recent quarters is a major risk to the Sandstorm thesis when it's being judged on an unusually weak quarter and this represents just one of 40+ producing assets in its royalty/streaming portfolio, with this set to grow to 45 assets by 2026 (Blackwater, Greenstone, and Platreef nearing construction completion).Elsewhere, on the debt side, there's no question that Sandstorm has elevated debt relative to its peers, but I believe the market has largely discounted this after the ~45% correction in the stock. This is because Sandstorm currently trades at a fraction of the cash flow multiple of its peer group, trading at less than 0.90x P/NAV and below 10x FY2025 free cash flow estimates (~$170 million) vs. many of its peers that trade at closer to 20x FY2025 free cash flow. Hence, with the company diligently working to pay down debt, its debt being quite manageable for a company of its scale with its margins, its cash flow set to increase materially in the next 18 months once construction-stage mines come online, and this already priced into the stock, the current net debt position is hardly a risk to the thesis. If the stock were trading at $9.00 and closer to fully valued, this might be a different story.Finally, addressing the per share argument, it is accurate that Sandstorm did not see growth in cash flow per share even if cash flow increased year-over-year ($42.1 million vs. $33.2 million), declining from $0.16 to $0.17 in Q2 2023. However, judging a company on per share growth post-acquisition (negative impact of a higher share count) when several of the most meaningful components of that acquisition have not yet been realized seems deliberately obtuse. This would be the equivalent of pointing out that Equinox has not seen per share growth following its Premier acquisition when the key asset is still in construction and not yet contributed any cash flow (Greenstone) or worrying that Fortuna Silver () has struggled to grow cash flow per share when its real reason for acquiring Roxgold was Seguela, not Yaramoko.Relating this back to Sandstorm, there are multiple assets that will deliver significant growth in cash flow per share and gold-equivalent ounces sold per share post-2024. However, they're in construction today, which made it a little difficult for them to generate cash flow in Q2 2023. So, for one to point out that cash flow per share has not increased would imply that one is unaware of these massive projects (Platreef, Greenstone, Robertson) that will contribute over 20,000 GEOs combined per year and closer to 30,000 GEOs once Platreef Phase 2 kicks in, or that one criticizing cash flow per share growth felt it was more convenient to leave this out to fit a narrative. And as I noted in my previous update, gold-equivalent ounce sales per 1,000 shares held will begin a new uptrend starting this year and progressively increasing over the rest of the next decade, and I have conservatively not include upside opportunities like Bayan Khundii, Lobo-Marte, Gualcamayo Deep Carbonate Sulphides [DCP], North Telfer, Woodlawn, and other smaller assets.To summarize, while there's no question there are risks here, I think there are far worse balance sheets in the sector, far worse reward/risk setups, and I would argue that these risks are more than priced in with the stock trading at an enterprise value of ~$1.90 billion with the potential to generate upwards of $200 million in annual free cash flow post-2026 be and debt-free if gold prices can cooperate. A debt-free royalty/streaming of this scale should command a free cash flow multiple closer to 20 (implied value of $4.0 billion), which certainly points to a significant long-term upside for patient investors. And one of my favorite setups is growth + room for multiple expansion, which is exactly what Sandstorm offers today. This is because the stock can be purchased at a depressed cash flow and P/NAV multiple with significant room for multiple expansion to its historical average and even further expansion to its peer group with the benefit of significant production growth.Sandstorm put together a solid Q2 report and while its debt pay down in the period was slightly lower than I expected ($8.0 million), the company has made it clear that it will prioritize debt repayment over buybacks in the future. In the company's defense, I can understand why it might want to buy back shares during the fire-sale on June 12th related to the GDX deletion mistake, which was arguably the best time to buy back shares other than mid-March 2020. Unfortunately, the continued focus on debt levels overshadowed what was a very productive quarter for multiple key assets, including a new well-financed partner at Hod Maden in SSR Mining, the consolidation of MARA by Glencore, continued exploration success at multiple assets where Sandstorm holds royalties, and confirmation that construction at Greenstone, Blackwater, and Platreef is progressing well.Given that  remains in the penalty box and a laggard over the past year vs. its royalty/streaming peers, I continue to see this as a rare opportunity to buy a high-margin business at a deep discount to fair value. Not only does it trade at a discount to all of its peers on a cash flow and P/NAV standpoint despite industry-leading diversification from a NAV standpoint and exposure to several world-class assets (Fruta Del Norte, Blackwater, Platreef, Antamina, Hod Maden, Greenstone, Caserones, Oyu Tolgoi, MARA), but it has a stronger registry of mining partners following its recent acquisitions, and this isn't even remotely reflected in its share price. So, with Sandstorm Gold Ltd. remaining on the sale rack and its investment thesis strengthened, I continue to see this as a top-5 reward/risk bet sector-wide.

Tourmaline Oil: Surging Ahead Amid Challenges,"Here's an update on  (), the largest natural gas producer in Canada and its fourth-largest gas processing midstream operator. Around 80% of the company's production is natural gas, and itI  Tourmaline Oil as a buy at US$43 due to reported substantial insider purchases of C$6 million (US$4.45 million) worth of shares within the past year. Tourmaline’s undervaluation and healthy balance sheet also caught my attention - with a P/E ratio of 4.65, an EV/EBITDA of 4.23, and just $494 million in debt for a $17 billion oil and gas company.Since then, the stock has risen 16.66%, outperforming the S&P 500 (), which rose by 9.11%. But the company's I’ve included a slide of Tourmaline’s 2023 estimated guidance for some background on what to expect in 2023 and how this quarter’s results compares to its full-year plan.In Q2, Tourmaline excelled despite challenges, such as Canadian wildfires, which negatively affected many natural gas producers. Those wildfires resulted in a 3% reduction in the company's production, causing delays in post-spring drilling and completion activities. However, Q2 production still averaged an impressive 495,918 boepd.The company reported an average realized natural gas price of C$4.31/mcf in Q2 2023, higher than benchmark prices of C$2.46. Strong production and low cash costs led to a robust Q2 cash flow of  ($2.28 per diluted share), and free cash flow of  ($1.59 per share). Net earnings were $510.7 million, or $1.49 per diluted share.Tourmaline also continues to reward its shareholders.First, it plans to declare a special dividend of $1.00 per common share on August 22, 2023, and since September, has distributed total dividends of $7.74 per share. The stock yields over 10% when factoring in those total dividends.The forward yield is likely much lower, but still substantial at an estimated 4%, based on the $.26  and $1 special dividend. But that yield could go much higher if more special dividends get announced.The company will also initiate a share buyback program on August 8, 2023, allowing it to purchase up to close to 17 million common shares over the next year, which, is likely a good idea given Tourmaline’s low valuation.In summary, Tourmaline's strong  and commitment to shareholder returns, combined with its healthy  (Net debt of $791.1 million or 0.2X its 2023 full-year forecast cash flow of $3.62 billion), position it as a solid investment option.Despite Tourmaline's impressive performance since our previous coverage, the stock remains compellingly undervalued. Currently, it carries a P/E ratio of  and an EV/EBITDA ratio of . Both figures sit comfortably below the sector medians, suggesting an attractive valuation.Given the strong fundamentals and strategic advantages that Tourmaline has displayed, including robust production rates, strategic cost management, and a commitment to shareholder returns, the stock deserves a higher premium.While Tourmaline's near-term prospects are promising, it's crucial for investors to consider the company's long-term growth strategy. The company's plan forecasts over 20% increase in production by 2026, with further growth expected through 2028.Furthermore, the company anticipates generating considerable free cash flow, between $1.44 - $1.76 billion annually until 2028. This accumulation of resources could potentially lead to a cash surplus of over $5 billion by 2028. Note, this estimation includes Tourmaline's base dividends but doesn't account for any potential special dividends from 2024-28.The company's  assumptions appear conservative, with NYMEX US figures projected at: $2.79/mmbtu for 2023, $3.47/mmbtu for 2024, $3.93/mmbtu for 2025, $3.92/mmbtu for 2026, $3.85/mmbtu for 2027, and $3.81/mmbtu for 2028. Keep in mind, not too long ago, natural gas prices were trading above $9/mmbtu; however, a realistic long-term average likely falls between $4-$5.Tourmaline Oil, Canada's largest natural gas producer, continues to demonstrate strong performance and commitment to shareholder returns. Despite being faced with challenges like wildfires, the company's Q2 2023 results exceeded expectations. Robust production levels, strategic cost management, and generous shareholder returns make this company stand out.Looking towards the future, Tourmaline's growth strategy outlines a production increase of over 20% by 2026, with expectations of generating substantial free cash flow. These projections, coupled with what I feel are conservative natural gas price assumptions, hint at big gains in the future.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Pay For Higher Gas Prices With These Oil Dividends,"Oil prices may be lower than they were at their peak last year, but they have steadily climbed over the last couple of months. Gasoline prices have soared, making fueling up a costly endeavor once again. In this report, we willCrude oil is a commodity, and thus its price can swing up and down quite a lot. We saw that over the last two years:Oil prices had been recovering from the pandemic's impact -- lockdowns, travel restrictions, and so on -- in late 2021, and oil prices soared even higher beginning in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Oil flow restrictions, sanctions, and so on caused oil prices toOver the last two to three months, however, oil prices have risen quite considerably. Supply cuts by Russia, Saudi Arabia, and overall OPEC+ have caused a weaker-than-expected supply picture. At the same time, most economies have turned out to be more resilient than previously feared -- the US economy and most other economies are continuing to grow, and it looks like central banks might be able to successfully engineer a soft landing. With recession worries dwindling and travel demand remaining strong, the supply-demand picture in the global crude oil market has turned decidedly in favor of oil producers, with crude oil trading north of $90 per barrel again. That's an oil price level that allows for massive profits for most energy companies, as they have reduced their break-even prices during the pandemic via efficiency investments, cutting unnecessary employees, and so on. In fact, some major oil companies such as BP () are positioning their portfolios to make them solidly profitable with oil prices at $60 per barrel -- with oil trading at one and a half times that price right now, they are gushing cash.Of course, the other side of the story is that consumers and businesses that need to buy oil-derived products are now paying a lot more than they did a couple of months ago, with  (now at the highest level this year) making fueling up quite costly once again.With high oil prices making fueling up (and heating) more costly, while higher oil prices result in bigger profits for energy companies at the same time, buying shares in these energy companies could be a good way to hedge one's oil price exposure. If oil stays high or rises even higher -- Goldman Sachs () has just lifted their oil price target to  -- then being exposed to oil equities will be beneficial, and the dividends from these stocks will help consumers pay for more expensive gasoline.Here are a couple of energy stocks that will benefit from higher oil prices and that offer nice dividend payouts at current prices, with the potential for dividend increases going forward.Suncor Energy () is a major Canadian oil sands player that has a large asset base, massive reserves, strong production levels, and that has a successful track record.Oil sands assets have high upfront costs but low decline rates and low proportional costs, which is why their break-even prices are rather low, once these assets are running. Since these assets can produce oil for decades, there is little reason to worry about reserve replacement, which is an advantage of oil sands players such as Suncor Energy compared to shale oil players, for example, as the latter oftentimes have smaller reserves and higher decline rates.Suncor Energy is solidly profitable with oil trading at $70 or so, as the company generated US$1.4 billion of profit during the second quarter of the current year. Meanwhile, cash flow was around US$2 billion during the quarter. For a company that is currently valued at US$44 billion, that's a pretty appealing earnings and cash flow pace. But oil prices are currently significantly higher than they were during the second quarter, on average, meaning profits during the current quarter -- and possibly Q4, unless we see a major oil price pullback -- should be considerably stronger.Suncor Energy uses these profits and cash flows in several ways. The company wants to bring down its debt levels further, while shareholder returns via dividends and share repurchases also play a large role. At current prices, the dividend yield is 4.5%, and there is ample room to lift the dividend further -- after all, the dividend costs just around US$2 billion per year right now, which is comparable to the company's cash flow during the second quarter alone.Shell plc () is a British/European oil supermajor. While the company has been vocal about increasing its green investments in recent years, the company is still very much an oil and gas player -- that's where the vast majority of profits and cash flows are generated. The new CEO also has dialed back the green energy rhetoric and plans to utilize a more returns-focused approach when it comes to green and new energy investments.Compared to US peers Exxon Mobil () and Chevron (), Shell and the other European supermajors -- BP () and TotalEnergies () are pretty cheap:Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies all trade at less than 4x forward EBITDA, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron are valued at 6x to 7x EBITDA today. Even the valuation of XOM and CVX is pretty low in absolute terms, but the others are even bigger bargains.Shell currently offers a dividend yield of 4.1%, which is well north of the broad market's yield and also more than what one can get from XOM and CVX. And yet, the payout ratio is very low: Shell's dividend costs $8.6 billion per year, while free cash flows totaled $42 billion over the last four quarters. Shell thus has massive room to increase the dividend in the coming quarters and years, and I expect that this will happen, as Shell will try to get the dividend to the pre-COVID level eventually.Devon Energy Corporation () is a smaller oil company that is focused on shale plays in the United States. While that has the disadvantage of smaller reserves, compared to oil sands players such as Suncor, Devon Energy could be attractive due to another trait: Its variable dividend strategy.Devon Energy offers a base dividend of $0.20 per share per quarter, which makes for a dividend yield of a little less than 2%. But on top of that, Devon Energy offers variable special dividends every quarter. Over the last year, the company has paid out $3.45 per share, which makes for a dividend yield of 7.3% at current prices. While the special dividends experience ups and downs, which is why there is no guarantee that they will be equally high going forward, the rising oil price environment should be a major tailwind for profits and thus also for DVN's special dividends. Even based on the payout during the most recent quarter, the dividend yield is very solid, at 4.2%, and it is, I believe, highly unlikely that we will  see a dividend increase as oil prices rise.Devon Energy trades for just above 8x forward earnings, which is a quite low valuation. Since oil prices have risen fast in recent weeks, analyst estimates could be too low, which would translate into an even lower ""real"" valuation.Rising oil and gasoline prices hurt consumers -- why not be on the other side of the trade and benefit from the price increase? I believe that energy companies can be attractive investments overall, and they help hedge against higher fuel prices. Suncor, Shell, and Devon are among the energy companies that could be nice income investments going forward in my view.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Consol Energy Is Firing On All Cylinders,"It's time to discuss , one of my favorite coal stocks.On June 22, I wrote an  titled . Since then, CEIX shares have returned 23%, beating the S&P 500Even better, the stock has crushed its major coal (both metallurgical and thermal) peers in the United States, who are both down on a year-to-date basis.In this article, we'll discuss what CEIX is doing right. The company is successfully exploiting export demand, cleaning up its balance sheet, expanding operations, and boosting shareholder returns.I'm extremely impressed, as management has turned CEIX into what might be the best coal stock on the market.So, let's dive into the details!Coal prices have been in a steep downtrend since 2022, caused by a mild winter in the northern hemisphere and weaker economic growth.Unlike most of its peers, CONSOL Energy doesn't seem to care.Its stock price is making new highs.As I've said in the past, this Pennsylvanian coal giant is making a lot of smart decisions. One of them is the focus on export markets. While coal will be a cornerstone of the North American economy for a very long time, it's in secular decline.For example, in the energy sector, coal demand peaked in 2008.As CEIX is a producer of thermal coal (coal used to produce electricity), it knows it needs to find new markets to sell to. After all, betting on pricing to save the day in the U.S. isn't a winning strategy.Looking at the overview below, we see that CEIX has increasingly focused on export markets. In 2017, more than 60% of its revenue came from domestic power customers. That number has dropped to 23%, using the most recent data.Now, the biggest share of its revenue comes from export industrial, power generation, and metallurgical (steelmaking) coal.On top of that, the company is making tremendous progress in its operations in America.For example, the Pennsylvania Mining Complex (""PAMC"") achieved its second-highest quarterly realized revenue per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold during 2Q23.CONSOL Marine Terminal also set a new record by shipping over five million tons.This performance aligned with the aforementioned strategic goal of focusing on exports, supported by strong relationships with railroad partners, which are Norfolk Southern () and CSX Corp. () - the two Class I giants that service the entire Eastern-third of the U.S.The increased annual throughput capacity of up to 20 million tons boosts CONSOL's position in export markets.To give you a few numbers, terminal revenues for the quarter reached a record $31.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA for the terminal hit a new quarterly high of $23.9 million, marking substantial growth compared to the prior year period.The second quarter also saw progress and challenges related to the Itmann Mining Complex.The ramp-up to full run rate production was near completion, marked by the installation of three continuous miner super sections underground.However, the ramp-up process faced delays due to challenging geological conditions, including sandstone intrusions and water infiltration in certain sections.With regard to demand developments, CONSOL saw weak domestic demand for its product in the second quarter due to a warm winter affecting coal demand for power generation.With regard to the export comments above, the marketing team successfully diverted a significant amount of product to the export market, especially in industrial and crossover metallurgical markets.For example, the Indian cement market, a significant industrial market for the company, showed substantial growth potential due to urbanization and infrastructure spending.According to :Furthermore, the crossover metallurgical market also performed well, with higher demand due to new mine commissioning and shifting global coal supply dynamics away from Russian coal.Hence, as we already briefly discussed, sales into the export market accounted for 78% of total recurring revenues, indicating a very successful strategy shift that could not have come at a better time.With regard to future sales, the company also maintains a robust contracting position, being nearly fully contracted for 2023 and securing contracts for 17.6 million tons for 2024, exceeding previous years' progress at this point.Besides the increasing focus on export markets, strength in emerging markets, and increasing output in its mines, the company has a healthy balance sheet.In the second quarter, the company successfully amended its revolving credit facility, adding $95 million in incremental capacity with commitments from new lenders.On top of that, restrictive covenants were eased, offering more flexibility for capital allocation. In other words, the rules of the credit facility were eased a bit, which shows more confidence from lenders. This was unthinkable 2-3 years ago.Related to this, the company's credit rating was upgraded to B+, reflecting its improved credit profile. It's still a junk rating, but the trend is up, which I expect to continue.Financially, the company generated $181 million in free cash flow during the quarter, with a significant portion deployed to reduce gross debt levels. The company achieved a net cash position for the first time, and its liquidity position stood at $515 million.Essentially, the company has more cash than gross debt.According to the company, proactive debt management led to a discretionary redemption of second-lien notes, resulting in a manageable debt structure with maturities separated by multiple years.As a result of solid demand and a healthy balance sheet, shareholder distributions are rising.For example, roughly 70% of the second quarter's free cash flow was allocated towards repurchasing nearly 2 million shares of the company's outstanding common stock.This brought the year-to-date share repurchases to 3.1 million shares, equivalent to almost 10% of the public float as of the end of 2022. Since introducing an enhanced shareholder return program in Q3 2022, the company has already returned more than $10 per share to its shareholders via buybacks and dividends in a span of just 12 months.This translates to a distribution yield of 12% using current prices!The current dividend yield is 5.2%.Going forward, the company will continue to prioritize buybacks as a flexible way to reward shareholders. Personally, I would prefer special dividends in cyclical industries like coal, but that's just me.Speaking of going forward, the company has a number of priorities.This part is the worst. It's hard to value stocks that are highly correlated to commodity prices. It gets even worse when stocks have avoided commodity weakness due to successful business improvements.In my prior article, I wrote that the consensus price target was $80, which implied 18% upside. I agreed with it.Now, CEIX shares are at $84.The consensus price target is now at $90.Once again, I agree with it.However, I do believe that the company has much more potential. Trading at just 5.0x forward earnings, I believe once we get support from higher natural gas prices, we could see a steep increase well beyond $120 per share.Having said that, I wouldn't chase the chart at these levels.Investors interested in buying coal might be better off waiting for a correction.I'm well aware that this comes with new risks. However, I'm not comfortable making the case to jump in after a strong rally - especially not given the pressure on (global) economic growth.Nonetheless, I will maintain a rating to reflect the company's long-term potential, its healthy balance sheet, and smart strategic decisions.Also, if you decide to invest in coal, be aware of sky-high volatility!The only reason why I don't own CEIX is my significant exposure to natural gas and oil. I also prefer to own the railroads that ship coal.The company's focus on export markets, prudent financial management, and strategic operational enhancements have been key drivers of its success.With a diversified revenue stream, record-breaking terminal revenues, and impressive shareholder returns, CEIX has solidified its position as a leader in the coal sector.The stock's recent rally and current valuation indicate substantial room for growth, but cautious investors might wait for a correction before considering an entry point.Considering CEIX's long-term potential, robust balance sheet, and astute decisions, I'm maintaining a  rating.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Realty Income Has Been Obliterated: Now At Compelling Levels," () is perhaps the most popular blue-chip real estate investment trust, or REIT, that pays a monthly dividend for income-thirsty investors. We have been closely watching the stock looking for a tactical entryMake no mistake, this company has a strong business model and a relatively strong . Right now it is still one of the best houses in a neighborhood that is deteriorating. The fact is that the recent moonshot in interest rates has led O stock, and so many otherOur take is that we will become more bullish when the likelihood of rate cuts grow. This is our opinion. REITs for the most part are seeing a generational buying opportunity brewing, but the carnage is not over yet. In the meantime, we have sought alternative sources of income and trades over the last 5 or so quarters as REITs have been crushed.We have been asked if the paper losses on REITs will be recovered? For the most part yes, but it will take a number of quarters, with dividends along the way. Here is the deal: Realty Income stock has been obliterated, but if investors start scaling in now, particularly if you are young, you can let the magic of compound interest work its magic over the next few decades. Come retirement, you will have a wonderful stream of income.The company is not going out of business. This is simply the start of a fire sale in the sector. It is not over yet. Buying now for the long term will likely pay off. We prefer to buy when the sector, and/or a stock, is set up for a rebound so that we limit losses, even paper losses.Is Realty Income a buy? In the very-near term, it is best to avoid if you are worried about your capital in the next two quarters. However, for investors, sales like this do not come around too often.The ideal time to buy will in our opinion be in 2024. Although we are under a higher-for-longer rate environment, 2024 is where we see REITs bottoming out as we see the Fed rate hike campaign , as we have discussed this in depth among our investing group membership. We also see the first rate cut in H2 2024. It is not just the fact that rates are high and this makes financing new properties more costly, or the refinancing of debt. Another issue is that it adds selling pressure, as investors are happy to move to cash or bonds and collect 5%, rather than take on equity risk. But as REITs go, O should be at the top of your shopping list after it has been obliterated. Buy why?For our many followers who are not familiar, Realty Income owns and manages a diversified portfolio of commercial properties leased to single tenants on a long-term, triple net basis. In our estimation, Realty Income's business model is well-positioned to continue to generate recurring revenues and withstand economic downturns. The company provides capital to middle-market regional operators and national retail chain store operators by acquiring and leasing back their retail sites over long-term periods, typically in excess of ten years. Triple-net leases are favorable as under a triple-net lease, the tenant is responsible for all property expenses, including taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Realty Income's current weighted average remaining lease term is about 9.6 years.At the start of Q3, Realty Income owned more than 13,000 properties across the U.S., U.K., and other European nations. The company leases property to around 1,300 clients. This low asset and client concentration is a positive factor for the company's sustainable business model over the long term.One of the major things to consider for a REIT is the tenant base and the occupancy rate at properties. Despite all of the ups and downs over the years, Realty Income's occupancy rate is close to 99%. Translation? This is a high-quality operator. The portfolio is sound and the company will keep generating recurring revenues for many years to come.One of the risks that is often cited is that the vast majority of its rental income comes from retail. In fact, 3/4 of the tenant base is retail. However, grocery stores and convenience stores are the two largest industries, accounting for about 19% of the total annual rent. These are recession-resistant businesses. We certainly understand the complaint over brick and mortar retail being a relic of the past with more and more people shopping online, but we do not view this risk as a threat to the life of the business model. Over 90% of the tenant base is resistant to the threat of e-commerce.What about fiscal performance? We see no signs of imminent distress. The company did of course merge with VEREIT a number of quarters ago, so it saw a boost to annual comps, but the key here is that cash flow remains strong as does funds from operations. Realty Income's revenues were $3.3 billion in 2022 with net income of $869 million and AFFO (adjusted funds from operations) of $2.4 billion, or $3.92 per share.In the , net income was $195.4 million, or $0.29 per share, while AFFO was $1.00 per share. The company also invested $3.1 billion in 710 properties and properties under development or expansion at an initial weighted average cash lease yield of 6.9%. There has been and will be some dilution here to raise cash, which is one of the bears complaints and there is merit to it. In Q2, Realty Income raised $2.2 billion from the sale of common stock with a weighted average price of $61.89, while the company also looks to a  with a number of financers to sell up to 120 million shares of its common stock, which was announced in August.We still like the  here, but will keep an eye on leverage. At the end of Q2, net debt to adjusted EBITDA (annualized) was 5.3x. The company had $3.5 billion of liquidity, which consists of cash and cash equivalents of $253.7 million to start Q3. The dividend is covered , and that is key.So what about as we look ahead? The rate environment will be higher for longer. So investors need to be concerned about the debt maturity schedule here. For a full look at the debt maturity, see , but there is some debt due in 2024, with many of the notes due later this decade. At the end of Q2, the company had $1.1 billion in multicurrency borrowings, Their 2023 term loans initially mature in January 2024 and include two 12-month maturity extensions that can be exercised. The company has a $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024. For mortgages payable, a large chunk of principal is due in 2024, $740 million of the ~$830 million outstanding.In terms of the notes, there are about $16.3 billion of notes, with maturities from 2024 through 2047. Nest year about $850 million in notes are due, with another $1 billion due in 2025. Keep a close eye on new issuances and steps taken to raise money. New notes are likely to come with higher price tags in this higher-for-longer environment, the same with any new mortgage activity that may occur in the future. Going further into detail on this topic is beyond the scope of this coverage initiation, but we will reiterate, read the filings.After this drastic selloff, which looks to continue, the valuation is at decade lows. If you factor in the debt and current cash levels we noted with the balance sheet, the enterprise value here at decade lows. Enterprise value to EBITDA results of 16x is over a 20% discount the last ten years 10 years. Price to rental revenue is under 9.6X, while the price to book as a paltry 1.1X.Should you buy Realty Income Corporation now? Well, it depends on your horizon. We like the fact that although it is fractions of pennies, the dividend is consistently raised. The dividend in our opinion is secure. We like the monthly income here. We also like the fact that the yield is now 6.3%.While the chart looks scary, and there is likely a bit more downside to go, a sub-$48 entry for the long-term is reasonable. We would add in $0.75 blocks from the current price of $48.44 down to $45. If you are patient, you can monitor the situation and wait for the lower end of this range. We see 2024 as the time to get back into REITs broadly speaking, but we have no crystal ball. Regardless of where the actual bottom is, $48 for Realty Income Corporation shares is a great price for the long-term investor.Stop wasting time!

Marathon Oil Corporation: I Like This Company Very Much,"Marathon Oil Corporation () has grown significantly over the last several years and now boasts a market cap of over $16 billion. The company's share price is very much tied to the price of both oil andWhat I think sets MRO apart right now is the impressive amount of shareholder value they are trying to pass on. In the last quarter alone MRO returned $434 million in total to shareholders. This was an increase of 10% from the returns in the first quarter to 2023. I think this underscores very well what you are getting right now with MRO, a company that is aiming toMRO is primarily engaged in the production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas within the United States and the African nation of Equatorial Guinea. In a significant move, the company acquired Ensign Natural Resources, a privately held company with a focus on natural gas operations. The deal resulted in MRO taking on a larger amount of debt to fund the deal, which right now is at $5.7 billion. The debt maturities are far out though so MRO is staying true to its focus on returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.MRO's primary operations within the United States are concentrated in the Bakken region of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford region in South Texas. Additionally, the company has smaller-scale operations in the New Mexico section of the Permian Basin and Oklahoma. This diversified geographic presence allows Marathon Oil to tap into various energy resources across the country. Looking at the guidance for the year, MRO sees improvements in the production levels in the US, with results expected to reach at or above the annual guidance provided. This I think is quite bullish as it tells me MRO is seeing the market as very positive right now and that higher earnings are possible. It's important to note as well that oil prices have appreciated quite a lot in value recently and if they remain above $90 I would expect even stronger shareholder returns in Q1 and Q2 FY2024.The results from the last I think are very strong. MRO has proven itself very capable of growing the top and bottom lines efficiently. The adjusted FCF for example was up by 70% sequentially. We have gone over before that MRO is a business that aims to maximize shareholder returns. Right now the company has an annualized distribution yield of 11% which is incredibly appealing to get a piece of, enough that a buy rating is suitable I think.While this may not necessarily be categorized as a risk, I would express hope for MRO that they place a higher priority on bolstering their current cash position. As it currently stands, their cash reserves fall short of the $200 million mark, which can be attributed, in part, to the significant $3 billion of Eagle Ford assets from Ensign Natural Resources. Considering that the company has upwards of $2 billion in levered free cash flows over the past year, it appears prudent to rebuild this cash cushion. Doing so would not only provide a safeguard for times when oil prices might face suppression and margins are lower but would also serve the interests of investors, as it could potentially facilitate the distribution of dividends.It should be said that MRO is quite exposed to the price of oil and natural gas. As we have seen oil prices rally in the last few months and reach above , so has the share price for MRO. A drop in oil prices will likely result in a drop in the share price for MRO. If this is a volatility level that some investors aren't comfortable with then perhaps MRO isn't the right choice.Looking at the assets though, despite the Eagle Ford's significant size and productivity, its reserves are comparatively smaller, with a greater inclination towards natural gas. There exists a possibility that MRO may not fully actualize the expected synergies stemming from its acquisition of Ensign or may have paid a premium for this acquisition.Comparing MRO to a similar-sized business like EQT Corporation () which also operates as a natural gas provider and has some reserves of crude oil, I think MRO looks like the better deal on the surface. Looking solely at the p/e of the two businesses MRO trades at a far lower one, under 11 right now, whilst EQT is nearing 20.As for the shares outstanding of EQT, they have been steadily climbing over the last few years, mitigating any significant form of shareholder value there, unfortunately. I think this is a trend likely to continue. The immediate shareholder value is found with MRO as they have a solid dividend, but as we have gone over buy back a large portion of shares as well. Both companies may be subject to price volatility but MRO offers a far better opportunity for long-term investment appreciation right now.MRO has been expanding its operations with various acquisitions over the years. The primary risk around the company seems to be the high debt levels, but paying down any current liabilities seems to easily be covered by the FCF of the business. The share price has come down over the last 12 months and with more and more capital being distributed to shareholders I think MRO displays a long-term investment opportunity right now, which brings me to rate it a buy.

Plug Power: History Of Underdelivering And Lack Of Tangible Results Raise Caution,"Plug Power Inc. () is a pioneering force in the emerging green hydrogen economy committed to a sustainable future. Despite ambitious plans in the coming years to produce green hydrogen internally to reduce costs and make their businessPlug Power focuses on the construction of a robust green hydrogen ecosystem, particularly by utilizing environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel cells to power industrial products such as forklifts and material handlingThe hydrogen production market is expected to grow by 9.2% until 2030, with demand estimated to reach  by 2050. This growth can be largely attributed to the rise of ESG-conscious investors, the implementation of stricter worldwide environmental regulations, and the decrease in the cost of many sustainable sources of energy. Renewable sources like wind and solar energy, which cost around $30-$50/MWh, have already gained popularity compared to grid electricity, which costs around . However, green hydrogen still has ways to go, as Plug Power sells its green hydrogen for , which translates to around $150/MWh, in line with nonrenewable sources. By 2030, Plug expects to decrease the cost of hydrogen to around $1.5/kg, putting it more in line with other renewables at around $45/MWh.1. Strategic Partnerships and expansionOn June 14, Plug Power announced its plan to reach a production level of 2,000 mt/d globally by 2030, emphasizing that it is reaching an ""inflection point"" this year. So far, they have aimed for 500 mt/d of green hydrogen by 2025 and 1,000 mt/d by 2028, and have taken their first steps by building a gigafactory in New York and have announced the launch of a liquid hydrogen production facility in Georgia. They also have recently made plans to develop more green hydrogen production plants in Finland to ramp up their global reach and overall production. This expansion hopes to fuel Plug's ambitious goals of reaching revenue goals of $1.4 billion in 2023 and its long-term target of achieving annual sales of $20 billion by 2030.In addition to its expansion efforts. Plug has added to its global  by announcing a collaboration with Blue EnerFreeze to introduce a green hydrogen ecosystem into its distribution center, further strengthening its reach in Europe. With prior partnerships with SK Group in South Korea and Acciona in Spain and Portugal, Plug Power will only continue to strengthen its global presence.2. Internal Hydrogen ProductionOne of the biggest potential catalysts for PLUG in attaining positive margins lies in its ability to create hydrogen internally. This quarter, their PPA and fuel delivered to customers showed significant negative gross margins of -490% and -437%, respectively. PLUG has largely attributed this large negative net margin to supplier disruptions and increased costs of  as of recent, which affects their steam-methane reformation (SMR) based green hydrogen production. By internally creating hydrogen through its own plants, Plug aims to vertically integrate its operations to decrease its operating costs and expects to be able to generate hydrogen at ""one-third of the cost [they're] paying the industrial gas companies"".Applying a method used by  to PLUG's Q1 earnings at the said 70% (2/3) discount, we observe a substantial increase in gross margins from -33% to +1% for their power purchase agreements and fuel delivery. Annual metrics also improve from -28% to +6% when the 70% reduction is factored in, giving us a glimpse of hope toward positive margins. In the coming year, I suggest investors look out for the realization of the effects of the  $3/kg green hydrogen tax credits, development into internal green hydrogen production, and continued growth of water electrolysis for signs of a turnaround in PLUG Power's financial metrics.Looking past PLUG's negative gross margins, their Q1 2023 report, while a bit underwhelming for an ""inflection point"", does have its merits. Plug reported revenue of $210.29 million, surpassing analyst estimates of $207.67 million, and demonstrated an impressive 49% YOY revenue growth in its Q1 report. The growth of net  from $500.65mm to now $1302mm LTM in recent years is promising for long-term growth and is reflected by the 67.3% revenue increase from equipment and related infrastructure sales. Despite the temporary cash burn and investment into R&D, this is taking, it does highlight the potential for reaching cost efficacy and economies of scale.Despite potential long-term revenue growth, PLUG's overall cash burn and negative income paint a grim short-term outlook. Although EPS improved by 29.63% YOY, it is still sitting at -0.35 as of Q1 2023 (keep in mind this number is lower due to share dilution) and continued negative gross margins drive operational . Overall, while Plug's advancements in facilities and capital investments may signal long-term growth, I'm not completely supportive of the idea of an inflection point until the cost of revenue manages to decrease to a reasonable amount and the problems with profitability and cash are resolved.1. Share Dilution to Cover Consistent UnprofitabilityCurrently, Plug Powers' primary problem lies in its profitability. Despite quite consistent revenue growth and occasional quarters of profitability, PLUG has never reported a year of positive cash from operations in its history of over 20 years. To sustain these operations, Plug has resorted to share-based compensation and secondary share offerings, significantly diluting shareholder value.Although the dilution has made Plug's reported negative EPS appear less severe, continuous dilution will likely deter prospective investors, especially if net income eventually turns positive. Despite CEO Andy Marsh's repeated promises of positive EBITDA since 2011 and even  2024 targets last year, management's continual inability to achieve profitability despite ambitious goals raises concerns.2. Green Hydrogen Use ResistanceCurrently, many large corporations have faced significant inertia in completely adopting sustainable sources of energy due to either existing economies of scale and cost efficiency in oil and coal usage or contractual agreements with such energy providers. As more companies begin to adopt 100% renewable energy initiatives within the next decade or so, Plug Power has the potential to capture a significant portion of the sustainable energy market. However, in the short term, Plug's future seems more uncertain. For right now, Plug's offering of green hydrogen remains relatively expensive for regular consumers and homeowners compared to its peers. While it has seen success in automobiles and industrial applications, green hydrogen efficiency is still  than direct electricity, standing at 68% in fuel production and 33% overall, compared to direct renewable energy 94% in fuel production, and overall efficiency of 77%. Though estimates suggest that green hydrogen will improve its efficiency faster than direct electricity by 2050, my doubts about the commercial scalability of such sustainable sources keep me hesitant to consider Plug Power as a worthwhile short to mid-term investment.While I am optimistic about Plug Power in the long term, using a DCF to value it is challenging due to uncertain cash flow projections, particularly with historically negative EPS. Instead, I opted to use valuation ratios to assess its value compared to historical levels and industry peers.First, looking at Plug's LTM P/S, we find it notably higher at 9.95x compared to the industrial sector median of . Despite this seemingly unfavorable ratio, based on Plugs' optimistic and ambitious revenue goals, this P/S ratio could be reasoned to portray investors' sentiment regarding Plugs' growth rate. Comparing it to its more historical values, we see that it is relatively discounted off its high in the past year of 29.09x, showing that its price may be reaching a more attractive valuation.Apart from the P/S ratio, another noteworthy metric is Plug Power's Price to tangible book ratio. With a ratio of 1.99x compared to the industry median of 2.74x, it suggests that the stock price may have bottomed out, leading to a potentially more attractive valuation and potential progress toward the management's mentioned ""inflection point."" While valuing a long-term horizon on this company will be difficult until net income and EPS turn positive, its more recent valuation ratios signal a potential opportunity to buy at a discount in the future.While Plug Power presents a fascinating opportunity in the emerging green hydrogen economy, its concerns related to profitability, corporate governance issues, and underperformance must be carefully considered. While a  recommendation may not be justified at this point, Plug Power's recent expansions and earnings improvements indicate the potential for long-term growth. During the next quarterly earnings report release, I advise investors to closely monitor whether Plug Power has truly reached the anticipated ""inflection point,"" as claimed by management.

Analyzing SilverBow's $700 Million Eagle Ford Acquisition," () announced  of Chesapeake Energy's () remaining Eagle Ford assets. This acquisition is expected to increase SilverBow's production by approximately 50% as well as boost its liquids percentage.SilverBow's free cashI estimate SilverBow's value at $40 per share in a long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas environment. This is a couple dollars higher than what  for it, although it should also be noted that SilverBow's risk and volatility has also increased due to more leverage and interest costs.SilverBow is paying $650 million in cash atAs well, there are $50 million in potential payments based on WTI oil prices during the year following the deal close. SilverBow will pay Chesapeake $25 million if WTI oil averages between $75 to $80 during that period or $50 million if WTI oil averages above $80 during that period.The Eagle Ford transaction is expected to close by the end of 2023 and the 2024 WTI strip is currently at $77.70 per barrel.One thing to note is that the effective date of the transaction is February 1, 2023, so the SilverBow could end up paying a substantially lower (such as $550 million including deposits) initial payment at deal close. There is some uncertainty though since production from the assets is expected to increase by around 3,000 BOEPD between Q2 2023 and Q4 2023, indicating some near-term development spending.SilverBow is financing the deal through a combination of second-lien debt and credit facility borrowings. It will increase its second-lien notes by $350 million, bringing the outstanding total up from $150 million to $500 million. The second-lien note maturity has also been extended from December 2026 to December 2028.As well, SilverBow's credit facility lender commitments have been increased by $425 million, going from $775 million to $1.2 billion.SilverBow has variable-rate debt with high interest rates (including 13+% on its second-lien notes), so the initial $650 million payment may increase its interest costs by $73 million per year before any debt paydown through free cash flow. If SilverBow's initial payment is around $550 million after purchase price adjustments, its interest costs would go up by around $64 million per year initially.The assets include around 42,000 net acres and 540 wells in the condensate rich area of the Eagle Ford.  that the assets averaged 29,000 BOEPD (60% liquids) in Q2 2023 production, while SilverBow expects production of 31,000 to 33,000 BOEPD (60% liquids) in Q4 2023.The liquids production appears to contain a fair amount of NGLs, so a rough estimate of the production mix may be 33% oil, 27% NGLs and 40% natural gas. The realized price for Chesapeake's Eagle Ford NGLs in Q2 2023 was only 31% of its realized price for Eagle Ford oil.Chesapeake mentioned that the assets generated around $50 million EBITDAX in Q2 2023, but SilverBow anticipates that the next 12 month EBITDAX (from October 2023 to September 2024) will be around $300 million, or 50% higher than annualized Q2 2023 EBITDAX.The reasons for that increase appear to be due to higher production levels as well as improved commodity prices. Around 40% of the production is natural gas, and NYMEX gas strip for the October 2023 to September 2024 period is roughly $3.60 compared to $2.10 in Q2 2023. Prices for oil and NGLs also look to be higher, albeit with a much smaller percentage increase.SilverBow also expects the assets to generate $140+ million in free cash flow during that 12-month period. Net of the increased interest costs, this may be closer to $70 million in additional free cash flow. Before the acquisition, I had projected that SilverBow could generate close to $70 million in free cash flow in the second half of 2023, so the acquisition should boost its free cash flow significantly. it has acquired 300 gross drilling locations, including at least 200 locations that can deliver a 40+% IRR at $70 oil and $3.50 gas.I believe SilverBow's acquisition comes at a reasonably good price and have boosted its estimated value by two dollars from $38 to $40 per share in a long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas environment. This is based on an enterprise value of approximately 2.75x its unhedged EBITDAX at those commodity prices.While SilverBow's estimated value has increased a bit, its risks have also increased, especially if commodity prices move lower. SilverBow may end up with around $1.3 billion in net debt at the end of 2023, which would be near 1.4x to 1.5x annualized proforma EBITDAX (including its hedges).SilverBow is aiming to reduce its leverage to around 1.0x by the end of 2024 and is also aiming to hedge the majority of its acquired PDP volumes over the next several years to reduce its risk.SilverBow has made a major $700 million acquisition of Eagle Ford assets that should increase its production by around 50% as well as boost its liquids percentage and free cash flow. However, it has also added significantly to its debt in the near-term, which is projected to end up at approximately $1.3 billion at the end of 2023.It also has high-interest rate variable debt that will currently result in an approximately 11% weighted interest rate on its new borrowings. The higher interest costs and debt levels make SilverBow Resources, Inc. riskier, although its estimated value also increases slightly to $40 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Shockwave Medical: Interesting Levels Again,"In January of this year, I called  a shockingly good performer in a premium article. Since its public offering in 2019, shares had risen from levels around the $30 mark to highsAfter buying the dip in January, shares have seen a huge rally during spring, but shares are back to square one. With a solid 2023 so far, current levels look interesting enough to get involved.Shockwave aims to transform the treatment of calcified cardiovascular disease, with the business aiming to create a new standard of care through intravascular lithotripsy (also known as IVL). With aging demographics dealing with progressive growth of plague in arteries, this is a rapidly growing market. At the same time, current treatment forms such as pressureThe idea is that Shockwave's use of lithotripsy, being an established form of treatment of kidney stones, can crack calcium which appears in arteries without hurting the soft issue. This allows for the expansion of the vessel, with more subsegments being in reach in which this therapy might be applied.Around the time of the public offering, the company targeted a +$8 billion addressable market, as it has quickly grown market share in this market. Just a $12 million business in 2018, revenues grew to $43 million in 2019, to $68 million in a tough 2020, with 2021 sales exploding upwards to $237 million. After posting 250% sales growth in 2021, the company managed to essentially break-even, resulting in massive operating leverage after a $65 million loss was posted in the year before.Given the higher sales run rate, a $415 million sales guidance for 2022 looked conservative, as turned out to be the case. While the 2022 results were not yet reported in January, the company had increased the full year sales guidance to $485 million after releasing the third quarter results, all while the business was solidly profitable already. Moreover, the company announced a $100 million deal for Neovasc, and outlined a $670 million sales guidance for 2023.Based on that outlook, and with shares valued at $6.6 billion in January, a 10 times forward sales multiple looked steep, but the pace of growth and solid profitability looked quite promising, as I bought the dip in the $180s.Since the start of the year, shares of Shockwave have seen a small boom-bust cycle. After trading around the $200 mark at the start of the year, shares rallied to the $300 mark in May, but by now shares are back to the $200 mark again.In February the company  its 2022 results, with revenues eventually coming in just shy of $490 million, as GAAP operating profits of $124 million were reported, while the company reconfirmed the midpoint of the full year sales guidance.The deal for Neovasc  in April as operating momentum continued. In May, Shockwave  a 72% increase in first quarter sales to $161 million as operating profits rose to nearly $40 million, while the company hiked the midpoint of the full year sales guidance by forty million to $710 million. Moreover, there were occasional M&A rumors which sent shares higher, and with shares up 50% in just three months, I took profits on the position, although that was in the $280s.These strong first quarter results meant that shares rose to the $300 mark, but by the summer enthusiasm faded a bit as second quarter sales rose by ""just"" 49% to $180 million, all while GAAP operating profits fell to $32 million. Nonetheless, the company hiked the full year sales guidance to $725-$730 million.With operating profits trending around $150 million per annum, earnings might come in around $3-$4 per share based on a share count of 37 million shares which still reveals a huge earnings multiple. Net cash was reported over $200 million again, despite the closing of the Neovasc deal.With a current operating asset valuation of around $7 billion, valuation multiple comes in around 10 times again based on the higher revised sales guidance for the year.With shares down to the $200 mark again, we are back to the same situation as we were in January, as 2023 has been decent from a sales outlook so far. While the second quarter earnings fell a bit, profitability remains impressive as the company is investing heavily in its future, but given the growth, profitability and net cash position, near-term profitability is not a concern.In fact, the company issued $650 million in convertible debt which carries just a 1% coupon here, bolstering the cash holdings in a huge way.Given all these observations and part (reportedly) takeover interest, as well as the nice profits on a former trade, I am happy to buy into Shockwave here again. A 10 times sales multiple and 50% very profitable growth rates create a compelling case, with a runway for growth, even if all valuations are impacted by the gravity induced by higher interest rates.If you like to see more ideas, please subscribe to the premium service ""Value in Corporate Events""  and try the free trial.

Karora Resources: Growth At A Reasonable Price,"It was a mediocre Q2 Earnings Season for the Gold Miners Index (), with the record average realized gold price offset by continued inflationary pressures (labor, contractors, and some consumables) plus one-time headwinds (weather, strikes) that diluted any expected margin expansion. Fortunately, Karora Resources released its  last month, reporting record quarterly gold production of ~40,800 ounces, a 33% increase from the year-ago period. This was driven byDigging into the production results a little closer, Beta Hunt had another exceptional quarter, producing ~25,700 ounces of gold, a 34% increase from the year-ago period. As noted, the increased production was driven by higher throughput (benefit of the completed second decline) and a further boost from better grades, which improved ~23% year-over-year to 2.62 grams per tonne of gold. And on a year-to-date basis, tonnes mined is sitting at ~597,000 at an average grade of 2.89 grams per tonne of gold, translating to an annualized rate of ~1.2 million tonnes per annum and slowly working towards the larger goal of 2.0 million tonnes per annum as part of the company's planned expansion. Meanwhile, regarding development, the second vent raise was completed, with the final ventilation raise set to be commissioned by year-end, a key deliverable to improve ventilation to support the higher mining rates.Moving over to the company's smallest Higginsville Mine Operations, ~217,000 tonnes were processed at 2.31 grams per tonne of gold in the period from Higginsville (total throughput of ~326,100 tonnes with Beta Hunt feed), benefiting from throughput from the Mouse Hollow Pit which began production in April. This translated to a significant increase in output year-over-year at marginally lower grades (Q2 2022: 2.32 grams per tonne of gold), and translated to production of ~15,100 ounces, up from ~11,500 ounces in the year-ago period. Karora noted that production in H2 will be sourced from the Mouse Hollow/Pioneer pits and Aquarius UG. However, while production was higher, cash costs at HGO increased year-over-year to $1,151/oz (Q2 2022: $1,130/oz), well above the industry average.Moving over to costs and margins, Karora controlled its costs well, reporting cash costs of $1,068/oz and all-in sustaining costs [AISC] of $1,160/oz, with the latter coming in below the industry average. The $24/oz decline in AISC year-over-year company-wide was related to lower costs related to higher grades at Beta Hunt, which offset the higher cash costs at HGO, offset by continued pressure on labor, contractor, power, and fuel costs at its operations. That said, all-in sustaining costs came in above my estimates of $1,140/oz despite lower sustaining capital spend than expected, driven by significantly higher G&A expenses of C$5.0 million vs. C$1.9 million in Q2 2022. And looking at the H1 results, year-to-date AISC is sitting at $1,184/oz, slightly above the $1,175/oz guidance mid-point.While the solid AISC performance year-to-date might suggest that Karora will beat its guidance mid-point of $1,175/oz, it's important to note that the company has benefited from extremely low sustaining capital spend relative to its annual guidance. In fact, H2 2023 should be much heavier from a sustaining capital standpoint, with year-to-date sustaining capital spend sitting at just ~C$0.70 million vs. a guidance mid-point of C$11 million. This represents less than one-tenth of planned spending this year and should offset the benefit of slightly higher production in H2 2023. So, while I would otherwise expect similar or lower AISC in H2 2023, it's not clear if this will be the case given the catch-up on capital spending (deferred to H2 due to wet weather), the rebound in energy prices, and similar production levels.Moving over to Karora's margins and financial results, Q2 AISC margins came in at $749/oz, well below my expectations of $820/oz because of a lower average realized gold price ($1,909/oz, which was one of the weakest prices sector-wide) and slightly higher AISC. Fortunately, the company still reported exceptional financial results, with record quarterly revenue of C$110.6 million (+50% year-over-year), operating cash flow before working capital changes of C$39.0 million, and free cash flow of C$10.6 million, a significant improvement from [-] C$23.6 million in the year-ago period. This helped Karora to finish the quarter with C$70.6 after a one-time payment (stamp duty of C$4.0 million) related to the Lakewood Mill acquisition.So, how does the stock look from a valuation standpoint?With Karora growing into a ~200,000-ounce producer, the company remains very reasonably valued at a market cap of ~$628 million, especially given that it has a better  than most junior producers and higher margins, with a path to further margin improvement (higher output and increased by-product credits as nickel production ramps up). And using what I believe to be a fair multiple of 1.0x P/NAV for a Tier-1 jurisdiction producer with below-average costs and 7.0x FY2024 operating cash flow estimates and applying a 65/35 weighting for price to net asset value (65%) and price to cash flow (35%), I see a fair value for Karora of US$4.15. That said, I prefer a minimum 40% discount to fair value for small-cap producers, pointing to an ideal buy zone of US$2.50 or lower to bake in an adequate margin of safety.For this reason, I remain neutral on Karora in the short term, given that while it scores well on asset quality and jurisdiction, it still doesn't meet my stringent buying criteria to justify starting a new position. And if one looks out across the sector, there are a handful of names trading at larger discounts to fair value, which I see as more attractive areas to allocate new capital. Obviously, I could be wrong, and the stock could continue to melt higher, but with diversified names like  () trading at just ~6x FY2025 free cash flow estimates with larger operations that are paying investors ~5.2% to hold their shares, I see names like these as better reward/risk setups.Karora Resources Inc. had a solid Q2 report, and I continue to see the stock as a top-15 producer sector-wide with the unique setup of growing production, improving margins, and a unique benefit from nickel by-product credits. Notably, the company also benefits from being one of the better exploration stories, with new discoveries that should continue to support reserve growth at Beta Hunt.That said, we have seen a pickup in Karora Resources Inc. insider sales recently, and while the stock remains reasonably valued; I don't see nearly enough margin of safety to justify starting a new position or adding to one's position above US$3.45. So, while I see Karora as a solid buy-the-dip candidate, I plan to remain on the sidelines unless we see lower prices.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Caterpillar Goes Boom! Now What?,"It's time to talk about one of my favorite machinery stocks. The Texas-based  company is having quite a year. The stock is up 17% year-to-date after rising 75% from its 52-week low!My most recent  wasAs much as I like these rallies, it's important to keep track of the risk/reward. After all, we might be in one of the most unusual situations in a very long time.While economic growth indicators point at significant weakness, Caterpillar is doing just fine. The company was able to raise its guidance and benefit from secular growth related to construction, energy, and others.Although I cannot make the case that CAT is overvalued, I'm getting cautious at these levels andIn this article, we'll discuss all of this and much more in light of new economic developments impacting CAT.So, let's dive in!Economic growth isn't in a good spot.The ISM Manufacturing Index, for example, has been in contraction for nine consecutive months, putting tremendous pressure on economic growth in cyclical sectors.Not only that, but in general, we're seeing increasing weakness in key indicators.For example, temporary work demand has rolled over last year. It's now flashing increased recession odds.Caterpillar doesn't seem to care.Looking at the chart below, we see the CAT stock price (upper part) and a comparison between the ISM Manufacturing Index and the total sell-off of CAT shares (percentage below their all-time high).As we can see above, CAT and the ISM index tend to move in lockstep. After all, CAT is so cyclical that lower economic expectations tend to result in lower earnings expectations as well.Not this time.In its second quarter, the company reported a very strong performance, exceeding its own expectations.This stellar performance was attributed to both higher sales volume and price realization.The chart below perfectly shows that CAT benefited from higher volumes and pricing power. Pricing power alone added $1.4 billion to the operating profit in the second quarter.Meanwhile, cost headwinds declined. Manufacturing costs were a headwind of just $283 million.Furthermore, sales to users grew by 16%, driven by robust demand across various end markets.Profit margins in these segments also exceeded expectations, with Construction Industries at 25.2%, Resource Industries at 20.8%, and Energy & Transportation at 17.6%.With regard to supply chain issues, which have been a drag on companies like CAT in the past, the company was upbeat.During its earnings call, the company highlighted improvements in the supply chain, which allowed for increased production during the quarter. This was also visible in the operating profit bridge I just showed.However, challenges persisted, particularly in the large engines segment, impacting Energy & Transportation and larger machines.I expect these issues to fade completely by early 2024.On top of sales growth in every segment, significant pricing power, and higher margins, the company is upbeat about its future.Not even the company's outlook was bad in this environment.Caterpillar's second-quarter results led to a revised positive outlook for 2023.The company anticipates higher total sales and revenues compared to the second half of the previous year, with positive sales to users and price realization.Dealer inventories, which tend to be challenging to predict precisely, are expected to remain at satisfactory levels.CAT also expects adjusted operating profit margins to be close to the top of its targeted range for the full year.Going into more detail, in North America, the company foresees positive momentum driven by non-residential construction growth due to government infrastructure investments.Looking at the chart below, we see that total construction spending in the U.S. is now close to $2 trillion, boosted by a massive surge in manufacturing construction spending, which is now close to $200 billion.While construction-related demand is likely to slow, I expect total order levels to remain healthy for the next few quarters.Looking on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Asia/Pacific (excluding China) is expected to see growth in Construction Industries, while China's sales are anticipated to remain weak.Last month, the Wall Street Journal ran an  with the headline .According to the article:China's largest banks are  as its construction market (the biggest in the world) is crumbling. For the foreseeable future, I expect China to remain a big issue for producers like Caterpillar.EAME markets are expected to be mixed, with strong construction demand in the Middle East but a downturn in Europe.With regard to the ISM Manufacturing Index, this is what the HCOB Manufacturing Index in Germany looks like:Other European nations aren't doing much better, which explains the company's mixed (but still upbeat) outlook.Latin America is expected to experience a decrease in construction activity.In Resource Industries, healthy mining demand is expected to continue, supported by elevated production levels and the transition to renewable energy.This is a long-term secular bull case I've mentioned in almost every single article. Due to the push for renewables, we're seeing significant growth in mining demand, which requires new mines and expansions. That's very bullish for Caterpillar.Having said all of this, I'm getting a bit more cautious.As much as I agree with CAT's comments that secular growth in construction and mining is likely to last, the air is getting a bit thin at current levels.CAT is currently trading at $281, which is exactly in line with the consensus price target.I tend to agree, as my own numbers show roughly a 7% upside using estimates that go as far as 2025. Please note that the 2024E net debt numbers in the overview below include $4 billion in pension-related liabilities.After massive EBITDA growth in 2021 through 2023E, the company is expected to see flat-ish EBITDA growth in 2024 and 2025. Analysts are unwilling to be more bullish, which makes sense in light of ongoing economic developments.While I believe that CAT is fairly valued at 12x EBITDA, there's good news for dividend investors.The company, which currently yields 1.8% after an 8.3% dividend hike earlier this year, is expected to grow free cash flow by high-single-digits in both 2024 and 2025.Over the past five years, the company has hiked its dividend by 8.9% per year. It has a track record of 29 consecutive annual hikes, making it a dividend aristocrat.Based on its current market cap, the company could end up with a 7% free cash flow yield in 2025, which is great news for its dividend, buybacks, balance sheet health, and ability to invest in its business.The company is expected to end this year with a sub-2x net leverage ratio.It has an A+ credit rating, one of the best credit ratings on the market, not just in machinery industries.Having said all of this, the road ahead for dividend growth investors looks fantastic. The only issue is its valuation.If we get a situation of further deteriorating economic growth and sticky inflation keeping the Fed from lowering rates (unless it is forced to at some point), I expect CAT shares to offer us a new buying opportunity.As a shareholder, I'm looking to add to my position close to $220 if I get the chance.While economic indicators signal concerning weaknesses, Caterpillar remains resilient, benefiting from growth in construction, energy, and other sectors.Its second-quarter performance was stellar, with sales surging by 22%, accompanied by an 88% increase in operating profit.However, with CAT trading at $281, in line with the consensus price target, caution is warranted.While the company's long-term growth prospects look promising, the current valuation leaves little room for immediate upside.For dividend investors, Caterpillar's commitment to growing free cash flow, a strong balance sheet, and an A+ credit rating offer a promising proposition.As a shareholder, I'm keeping a watchful eye, anticipating a potential buying opportunity of around $220 if economic headwinds create a more favorable entry point.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

"ENFR: Pipelines And Profits, A Dive Into The Energy Infrastructure-Based ETF","The energy sector is presenting an interesting picture right now. On one side of the coin, there are oil companies that are raking in the cash, thanks to the high oil prices. On the other side, there's a bit of a pickle forDemand for energy is staying strong, both here at home and on the international stage. That's music to the ears of midstream companies and MLPs-they're cashing in on this demand and riding high. Enter the  (In my , I laid down a case in favor of investing in the energy infrastructure sector and Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF specifically, a stance that has only grown stronger since then. In my view, it's a great option for investors looking to get a piece of the action in high-quality energy assets and definitely worth a spot on your radar.The Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF comprises 27  energy infrastructure companies and Master Limited Partnerships [MLPs] in the U.S. and Canada. It's a moderately sized fund, managing assets worth $124.5 million, and offers a dividend yield of 5.10% (based on the 30-day SEC yield). It is significantly smaller than some of its counterparts, like the Alerian MLP ETF (), the largest in the energy infrastructure domain, boasting over $7.1 billion in assets under management.Unlike numerous competing ETFs with a primary focus on MLPs, such as Alerian MLP ETF, ENFR incorporates both c-corporations and MLPs. In my view, this approach provides investors with a more comprehensive exposure to the energy infrastructure sector compared to the larger, MLP-centric ETFs.This distinction is vital because some of the biggest energy infrastructure players, like Kinder Morgan () and Enbridge Inc (), operate as c-corporations. These major companies are often overlooked by MLP-centric ETFs. I believe this is a significant oversight, as it denies investors access to companies that are pivotal to North America's energy infrastructure. For instance, Enbridge plays a crucial role, transporting  a third of all North American crude oil production, while Kinder Morgan's pipelines handle nearly 40% of the region's natural gas production. For those seeking comprehensive sector exposure, I consider ENFR to be the superior option over MLP-focused ETFs.Those familiar with my work know I've extensively discussed the U.S. rig count's decline and its impact on certain oilfield service providers, as highlighted in my  Ranger Energy (). Drilling activities have indeed decelerated in the U.S. throughout 2023, with a reduction of 150 rigs since the year's commencement,  to Baker Hughes (). By last week's close, 622 rigs were operational in the U.S., comprising 501 oil and 117 gas rigs-down from 618 oil rigs and 152 gas rigs at the year's onset.While this situation poses challenges for oilfield services companies facing diminished demand, it actually hasn't translated into a drop in oil and gas production. In fact, U.S. production levels have risen. Despite a slowdown from the shale boom era, this year has seen an increase in production volumes, showcasing enhanced efficiency from oil and gas producers, enabling them to extract more with fewer resources. U.S. oil production climbed to 12.99 million bpd by July, an increase from 12.57 million bpd at the start of the year, as per U.S. Energy Information Administration . Concurrently, gas production also  to 3.22 trillion cf in July, up from January's 3.16 trillion cf.Should oil prices maintain their strength, we could witness a revival in rig counts as U.S. producers potentially increase drilling activities to meet rising energy demands and compensate for OPEC+ supply gaps. This scenario might boost U.S. oil and gas production growth.Oil prices have seen nearly a 10% surge over the past three months, with WTI hitting $86 a barrel at the time of this writing. This uptrend is partly attributable to OPEC+'s  restrictions. Just last month, Saudi Arabia-the group's powerhouse-committed to extending its one-million-barrel-per-day output reduction until the end of 2023, a stance echoed by Russia in its decision to keep its crude oil exports down by 300,000 bpd during the same period. The International Energy Agency has  the potential for these actions to push the oil market into a deficit in Q4-2023.Compounding this are the escalated geopolitical tensions following the Israel-Hamas conflict. While Israel is not a significant player in the global oil market, the conflict's potential to spread, particularly to the Persian Gulf region, cannot be overlooked, as it may disrupt oil supplies. A potential tightening of U.S. sanctions on Iran  withdraw 500,000 bpd of Iranian oil from the market, further constricting supply and potentially elevating prices.Nonetheless, the current production lull from OPEC and its allies presents a unique opportunity for U.S. oil and gas producers to step in, bridge the gap, and expand their market share. This scenario would ensure a steady flow of oil and gas through pipelines, guaranteeing sustained demand for energy infrastructure assets, which is a positive development for the midstream sector.The energy infrastructure companies and MLPs within the ENFR portfolio are poised to reap benefits from the current business climate, displaying promising potential for earnings growth. Note that ENFR is top-heavy ETF, predominantly influenced by the largest players in the energy infrastructure arena. The ETF's top-10  encapsulate the industry's giants, including Enterprise Products Partners () and Enbridge. Collectively, its leading 10 holdings represent a substantial 65% of the ETF's total assets.Amongst these, the top two holdings-Enterprise Products and Enbridge-exemplify ENFR's strength in diversification, blending both MLPs and C-corporations in its asset pool. Enterprise Products, an MLP, and Enbridge, a C-corporation, highlight the ETF's capacity to fairly represent the energy infrastructure industry.Exploring ENFR's top holding, Enterprise Products stands out as one of the world's biggest midstream companies. It boasts an impressive assortment of midstream assets, notably within the Natural Gas Liquids [NGL] value chain. Enterprise Products' reach  over 50,000 miles of pipelines, augmented by an array of natural gas processing plants, fractionators, and PDH and iBDH facilities. This extensive asset base is matched by strong demand, as evident in its  results in which its pipelines achieved record oil equivalent volumes of 11.9 million barrels.Furthermore, Enterprise Products exhibits stellar performance in generating Distributable Cash Flows [DCF], consistently surpassing cash distributions and resulting in a robust coverage ratio. A case in point: the second quarter saw the firm generating $1.7 billion in DCF,  to a solid 1.6x coverage ratio. With a proven track record of converting high-quality assets into steady cash flows year after year, Enterprise Products has maintained an upward trajectory in dividend growth for over 25 consecutive years, affirming its commitment to unitholder value.Currently, Enterprise Products is channeling its efforts into numerous  initiatives aimed at capturing the expanding U.S. oil and gas production volumes. The completion of four major projects, including a cryogenic natural gas processing plant, an NGL fractionator, and a propane dehydrogenation [PDH] plant marks significant progress. Alongside these completed projects, an additional capital commitment of $4.1 billion has been earmarked for upcoming projects that will come online in the coming quarters and are poised to boost earnings and cash flow, which ensures sustained distribution growth. This ongoing development bodes well for ENFR's performance.Switching focus to Enbridge, ENFR's second-largest holding, we observe a formidable asset base comprising liquid pipelines, and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities. Additionally, Enbridge's portfolio extends into renewable energy, featuring wind farms in Europe and solar energy projects across North America. Much like Enterprise Products, Enbridge stands out for its consistent cash flow generation and a stellar record of dividend growth spanning over 28 years.Enbridge is working on a  suite of 17 growth projects, representing a cumulative investment of CAD $19 billion (approximately $13.8 billion USD). Notable projects include the 137-mile Rio Bravo , poised to supply natural gas to the Rio Grande LNG export facility in Texas, and the Woodfibre LNG export  in British Columbia, boasting a production capacity of 2.1 million tons per annum. Additionally, a significant expansion  British Columbia natural gas pipeline system is also underway. These initiatives, set to materialize over the next five years, are expected to fuel Enbridge's growth trajectory, subsequently enriching ENFR's potential for returns.ENFR's biggest holdings have consistently demonstrated their capacity to reward shareholders through dividends while generating strong cash flows. They appear to be strategically positioned to reap the rewards of the strong business environment, investing significantly to maximize the advantages of the favorable market conditions. As they bring their new projects to fruition, we can expect their earnings and cash flows to continue growing. This, in turn, should enable them to sustain and potentially increase their dividends and distributions, positively influencing ENFR's overall performance.When we delve into the valuation aspect of ENFR's holdings, the findings are intriguing. Approximately 37% of the holdings, constituting a combined weight of 36%, have garnered attractive valuation grades ranging from A+ to B- on Seeking Alpha's Factor Grades. Meanwhile, an equivalent number of holdings, representing a slightly higher weight of 38%, have been assigned valuation grades varying from C+ to C-. Focusing on the ETF's top two holdings, Enterprise Products and Enbridge  been  valuation grades of C+ and B- respectively. However, it is noteworthy that within the top-10 holdings, four companies-Cheniere Energy (), Kinder Morgan, Williams Companies (), and Targa Resources ()-collectively accounting for 21% of the total weight, present less attractive investment opportunities with valuation grades ranging from D to F.Given this assortment of valuation grades, creating a diverse landscape with no clear inclination towards higher attractiveness in terms of valuation, my assessment leads me to categorize ENFR as a 'hold'.It is also important to address the potential risks when evaluating investment opportunities. Although ENFR presents a promising outlook, navigating the current high interest rate environment remains a formidable challenge for energy infrastructure companies and MLPs. Rising interest rates directly impact borrowing costs, potentially hindering the development of new projects and limiting future growth prospects. For energy infrastructure companies burdened by substantial debt, the current financial landscape is particularly challenging. Refinancing in such conditions escalates costs, potentially straining their financial resources. This, in turn, could lead to reduced profits, leaving less capital available for shareholder payouts.Additionally, the high borrowing costs do not operate in isolation. The high interest rate environment also contributes to a broader economic slowdown, with potential repercussions for energy demand. A contraction in energy consumption could place further pressure on the energy infrastructure sector. This scenario is not without precedent; the industry faced significant headwinds during the pandemic as energy demand plummeted. While it's critical to acknowledge that the severity of the pandemic's impact represents an extreme case, it serves as a stark reminder of the industry's vulnerability to demand fluctuations.

"Northern Oil and Gas: Production May Exceed 110,000 BOEPD In Q4 2023","Northern Oil and Gas () may now exceed 110,000 BOEPD in average production during Q4 2023. It has been growing production through acquisitions as well as good performance from newer wells that it participated in.I now expect NorthernIn a longer-term $75 WTI oil environment, I estimate Northern's value at $45 per share now and believe that it can generate around $6 to $7 per share in free cash flow (before cash income taxes) per year at $75 oil while maintaining production levels.Northern's recent acquisitions plus its improved outlook for free cash flow during the rest of the year help boost its full-year 2023 guidance to reflect well performance that exceeded expectations as well as its Forge and Novo acquisitions. The Forge acquisition closed at the end of Q2 2023 and the Novo acquisition closed in the middle of Q3 2023.Northern now expects to average approximately 98,000 BOEPD for the full year, including 101,000 BOEPD in Q3 2023 at the guidance midpoint. Northern's Q4 2023 production may end up at around 112,000 BOEPD based on its full-year guidance.At the current strip (roughly $79 WTI oil and $2.90 NYMEX gas) for the second half of the year, Northern is projected to generate $1.088 billion in revenues after hedges.I have assumed that Northern realizes approximately 90% of NYMEX for its natural gas during the second half of the year. Northern bumped up its full-year guidance for realized natural gas prices to 85% to 95% of NYMEX. However, given that Northern realized approximately 140% of NYMEX for its natural gas during the first half of 2023, it would only need to realize 60% of NYMEX during the second half of the year to exceed the high-end of its full-year guidance range. Thus, I believe that Northern's full-year guidance around natural gas realizations is quite conservative.Northern's capital expenditure budget was more heavily weighted to the first half of the year and thus may end up around $340 million for 2H 2023.I now expect Northern to generate $394 million in free cash flow during 2H 2023 at current strip prices.Northern had $1.69 billion in net debt at the end of Q2 2023, which included the costs of the Forge acquisition which closed on June 30. Northern paid another $431 million (after taking into consideration its $37.5 million deposit) upon closing of .Northern's current quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share adds up to approximately $35 million per quarter.Thus, Northern is now projected to end up with $1.8 billion in net debt at the end of 2023, before the impact of any additional transactions or share repurchases. This would be approximately 1.1x Northern's annualized Q4 2023 EBITDAX, which is a manageable level for the company.I have increased Northern's estimated value to around $45 per share based on long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. This is based on production of 112,000 BOEPD (63% to 64% oil). At that production level and those commodity prices, Northern should be able to generate over $1.6 billion EBITDAX per year. If Northern can maintain 112,000 BOEPD with an $850 million capex budget, then it would have around $650 million in free cash flow before cash income taxes (which are expected to be relatively minimal in 2024).This is close to $7 per share in free cash flow based on Northern's current outstanding share count, or around $6.20 per share if its convertible notes are converted into shares and its outstanding warrants are exercised.Northern has been rapidly growing production through acquisitions, while strong well performance has also helped it. Northern's Q4 2023 production may end up at around 112,000 BOEPD now.If it attempts to maintain that production level, I believe that Northern can generate $650 million in free cash flow per year before cash income taxes at $75 WTI oil. Northern may end up with 107 million to 108 million shares if its convertible notes are converted into shares and its warrants (issued for the Veritas acquisition) are exercised.

Shell plc: A Buy For Multiple Reasons,"Finding sectors that offer investors consistent income and solid total returns is hard. Growth and dividends investors usually have different goals, but some investments will still appeal to people with different philosophies for allocating capital.One of the best performingStill, not all energy companies have benefited equally from the rise in oil prices. One oil company thatShell plc is  2.07% in the last 5 years, even while oil prices have risen consistently during this time period, the S&P 500 () is up 58%, and peers such as Exxon Mobil () and Chevron () have performed much better. Chevron is up 39% since early 2018, and Exxon Mobil is up 19% during this time frame.Today Shell plc is a buy. The company finally has a clear plan to turnaround the business, England's windfall profits tax is likely to be significantly reduced if not completely eliminated in the near-term, and oil prices should still remain at reasonably elevated levels for multiple reasons. The stock also looks undervalued using a number of different metrics.Shell's new CEO, Wael Sawan, has outlined a clear vision that is focused on the company's profitability and maximizing shareholder returns. The new leader has also made clear that the company will be moving away from less profitable clean energy initiatives that aren't producing consistent returns. Sawan has also made clear that he does  want to cut oil and gas production right now. His comments represent a reversal of what Shell has stated about company's prior plan to cut oil production before 2030 in previous years. Sawan has also stated that the energy producer  to invest $40 billion dollars in oil and gas production between 2023 and 2035, while the company's currently budgeting $10-$15 billion for lower carbon projects during that same time period.Shell's oil production numbers have fallen significantly since 2019, so Sawan's aggressive capital expenditure plans should enable the company to increase production levels significantly in the coming years. Shell has also taken specific action to increase shareholder returns, with the company recently by raising the dividend by 15% and committing to a buyback of $3 billion earlier this year in July.England is also likely to significantly reduce if not eliminate the windfall profit tax that has created a 75% effective tax rate on energy companies in the country such as Shell plc. The tax was originally put in when Brent Crude prices briefly spiked to over $120 a barrel when Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, and overall inflation levels were higher than price levels are at now, but energy prices have now fallen to prewar levels. England has already stated they plan to eliminate the tax when oil returns to a historical normal price for two consecutive quarters that the country has  at $71.40 a barrel, which is only slightly below the current price of $84.65 a barrel. Eliminating this tax would return the taxation level of energy companies to 40%.This tax was also only implemented when overall inflation levels were very high, and these price increases put significant pressure on British politicians. Multiple energy companies in England, including Harbour and Total Energies, have said these producers plan to significantly reduce investments and cut jobs in the UK if this tax is not reduced as well. Energy prices have fallen significantly over the last year, and inflation levels have also come down in recent months, this tax will not likely remain long-term even if these price levels remain slightly above the $70 a barrel level.Oil prices are also not likely to fall significantly from current levels either though, for a number of reasons. The average decline rate per year globally of oil fields is also 6%,  remain limited, and the energy industry is also still recovering from an extended period of significant  from 2016 to 2020 when prices were often at low levels. The recent bombing of key infrastructure in the Crimea, as well as the continued counter offensive by Ukraine, continue to suggest this conflict is unlikely to end anytime soon. Upstream investments in the energy sector have also fallen from $700 billion a year in 2014, to between $370 billion to $400 billion today. The IAEA is forecasting global demand for oil to increase by nearly 2% this year from 2022 levels. Oil demand is supposed to continue to grow by about a half a percent a year from now until 2030. The Energy and Information Administration also recently updated the agency's forecast for crude oil prices in 2023 to $79 a barrel.This is why Shell looks undervalued at the current share price. The company currently  at .71x expected forward sales, 3.59x likely forward EBITDA and 5.37x forecasted forward EBIT. The sector median valuation  2.22x predicted forward sales, 5.77x likely forward EBITDA, and 9.45x expected forward EBIT. This low valuation is despite the company's net margins being at near 10-year highs.The company also  $45 billion in cash on the balance sheet, $64 billion in free cash flow, and mostly long-term debt of $84 billion, so management should continue to have a lot of flexibility to maximize shareholder value if oil prices stay at or around current levels.Shell plc has struggled for most of the last decade, but Sawan has finally laid out a clear plan to focus on the company's core oil business with an emphasis also on maximizing shareholder gains. While this leading oil company hasn't performed well over the last decade, new leadership and bullish trends in the oil industry should lead to patient shareholders of this energy producer being rewarded.

BND: Why Bonds May Crash Soon - A Deep Dive Into Inflation,"August saw an increase in volatility across asset classes in the financial market. The general trend was similar to during the drawdowns in early 2022; stocks and bonds declined while commodities rose. The uncommon positive correlation between stocks and bonds hasIn my view, one of the most telling signals for financial markets will likely be actions in the bond market, as seen in the broad low-risk bond ETF, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF (). I have held a bearish view on BND , covering the ETF last . Since then, the bond market has seen slight declines, with BND pushing against its support level of around $70 asThe last two weeks of August saw a reversal of this bearish trend, with stocks and bonds bouncing up and crude oil seeing a slight retracement. In my view, this situation creates a significant opportunity, either signifying a general end to the ""interest-rate & inflation"" issue or its ill-timed return. This return is ""ill-timed"" because interest rates and inflation usually fall as the economic outlook slows. It is, to me, a fact that the economy is slowing (however, the extent to which can be debated); should inflation and long-term interest rates rise  the slowing economy, there could be tremendous implications for financial markets. In other words, if BND breaks below the $70 level and continues lower, I expect a rapid unwind in stocks and bonds. Conversely, if the bond market rebounds from its low level, I believe stocks and bonds may remain safe or positive for some time.Firstly, we must consider that the economy is not operating in a standard paradigm due to the enormous volatility created in 2020. During that year, the economy slowed exceptionally quickly. Still, it rebounded fast due to the ""back and forth"" switching from mandated lockdowns, generally leading to much lower production levels that have only recently normalized. Further, extreme money-supply creation and stimulus have added to the supply-side inflationary pressures, artificially creating economic demand through temporary but significant increases in personal income levels. Today, all of that stimulus is coming out of the economy as the Federal Reserve slowly allows its balance sheet to decline. Short-term borrowing costs are also much higher than usual to slow inflation created in 2020-2021.In the future, inflation will be essential for BND's performance because long-term interest rates are susceptible to inflation expectations. BND's yield-to-maturity is 4.8%, with a weighted average maturity of 8.9 years and a third of its holdings in corporate bonds (two-thirds in Treasuries). Mostly, these securities are not priced for high inflation levels. The current 10-year Treasury """" rate is 2.24%, meaning the bond market is pricing for 2.24% average inflation over the next ten years. The typical level is 2% (the Fed inflation target), so bonds are fundamentally not expecting inflation to remain abnormally high for long. This measure strongly correlates to oil prices because that commodity is outside the Federal Reserve's control. See below:The reality is that most inflationary factors are susceptible to oil prices. One of the most significant components of the CPI is energy itself; however, prices for food, clothes, and virtually all goods are also tied directly to oil prices because transportation costs are the greatest total production cost for almost all manufactured goods today. When human labor was more of a necessity in the past, oil (and natural gas) may not have been as essential, but today, oil and other energy costs are the primary supply-chain input costs.Thus, ""official"" CPI inflation is around 3.3%, not far above the Fed's 2% target and the 2.24% target in the bond market. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is still much higher at ~4.85%. To me, even core inflation is too oil-sensitive because manufactured goods primarily use energy (oil or electricity) to manufacture and transport raw materials to the end buyer. With that in mind, I believe the ""most accurate"" inflation measure is ""services inflation excluding energy services"" because that is primarily focused on human labor costs, which are far less correlated to energy prices. See below:In my view, services inflation is ""true"" inflation, as a measure of fundamental economic trends, because it is the least exposed to changes in commodity prices. Of course, higher food and fuel costs slowly push wages higher, creating higher service prices; however, the relationship is a few steps removed and indirect compared to goods-centric inflation measures. Based on services prices, inflation is still around 6.1% today, only 1% below its peak level and not falling as nearly as quickly as the commodity-sensitive inflation measures.Significantly, services prices consistently rose faster than others throughout most of the 2010s. Commodity prices were extremely low during this period due to overproduction, leading to very low inflation. However, as services, such as rent, healthcare, and other costs, rose faster than inflation, most households have had to spend far more on  ""feel"" inflation is higher than the official numbers suggest.Investors, analysts, and most people would benefit from understanding services inflation because it fills the gap on many disconnects in the economic data today. For example, the ""real GDP"" (i.e., ""the economy"") contracted in 2022 is enough to signify a recession typically. Still, it may grow  - an extremely high real economic growth level. Of course, most working Americans probably do not feel the economy is booming, likely because """" has been  stagnating since Q3 of 2021. In other words, the economy appears to be increasing  commodity prices have fallen considerably since early 2022. This GDP measure is not falling fast but signifies a prolonged, gentle, but prolonged ""recession-like"" trend experienced by many households and  today.BND's price trend will fundamentally depend on official CPI inflation, so if commodity prices fall further, we can expect bond yields will not rise. Given the inflation breakeven rate, CPI inflation must consistently fall to around 2-3% for BND to be reasonably priced. If CPI inflation fails to fall that far, BND will likely fall further as long-term rates adjust for prolonged higher inflation. Based on non-commodity inflation (services inflation), fundamental inflation is still around 6.1% today and has hardly budged despite the Federal Reserve's efforts. Thus, if commodity prices remain flat or rise, then I believe it is likely that the broader consumer price index will see a sharp rebound.For the most part, commodity prices are floating around late 2021 levels, near ""support"" zones held since then. Energy commodities have recently seen a sharp upward rebound, almost certainly promoting a rise in inflation measures over the coming months (note: there is some lag between energy futures and realized consumer prices). Base metals are around support levels and  will not rise significantly due to China's property market woes. Agricultural commodity prices are always a wildcard due to their relationship with the weather but may increase due . See below:Of these commodities, energy prices have the most significant impact on inflation, with agricultural commodities being a material secondary factor. As detailed in "","" many supply-side factors could cause energy commodities to rebound even if economic demand slows - mainly due to the end of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve release. Obviously, that could create a huge positive factor for inflation levels. However, inflation may still rebound even if oil and gas remain flat because CPI inflation is being heavily weighed down by  in consumer energy prices. As long as energy prices do not continue to fall, that level will return to 0% YoY, likely causing overall CPI inflation to rise  services inflation of ~6%.While my discussion may seem to be nitpicking on how the CPI is measured, I believe this specific issue will significantly impact BND's performance over the coming year. By and large, investors expect inflation to continue to decline due to the Fed's measures. However, the data suggests that inflation is only low due to the decline in commodity prices, led by improved supplies, much of which was from a release of stored ""emergency"" oil. As investors realize that inflation should rebound as that beneficial factor ends, I expect the long-term bonds in BND will re-price lower to account for higher inflation levels. BND's ""duration"" is  inflation outlook should cause it to lose around 6.5% in value.Two-thirds of BND is in Treasuries while a third is in corporate bonds, all of which are investment grade, with most having A to BBB credit ratings near the ""bottom of the top"" of the corporate credit risk ladder. These bonds typically pay a 1-3% premium to Treasuries of an equivalent maturity. That ""spread"" usually rises with economic risk since that causes corporate bond downgrades. A decent correlation exists between the manufacturing PMI (an economic growth indicator) and corporate credit spreads. However, corporate credit spreads are very low today compared to the negative PMI growth outlook. See below:If the PMI is below 50, US manufacturing companies are seeing a slowdown in business activity. The current measure is around the lowest level since 2008, excluding the lockdown-generated crash in 2020. The corporate credit spread did rise as the PMI began to fall, but spreads are still below normal despite a fundamentally negative manufacturing outlook. To me, this indicates that corporate bonds are overpriced due to excess demand for investment products, failing to account for the economic risks in those bonds. In my view, this is a secondary negative factor that could harm BND's value over the coming year.The final bearish factor for BND is the potential rise in the yield curve. The yield curve is very inverted today, usually indicating economic stagnation; however, stock market crashes and recessions do not usually occur until sometime after curve inversion happens, averaging around . The curve inverted in July of 2022, fourteen months ago - implying we're in a prime time for a recessionary crash. See below:Most often, the yield curve rapidly steepens during the crash as the Federal Reserve reduces its interest rate outlook due to disinflation-created recessions. Long-term rates are comparably less sensitive to recessions than short-term rates driven by Federal Reserve management. However, despite , the Fed is not keen on cutting rates, likely because fundamental inflation levels are well above their target.Accordingly, a re-steeping of the yield curve would cause BND to decline as long-term rates slowly rise above short-term. If the curve increases back to its ~1.2% average without the discount rate being cut, BND's yield will increase by  1.9% (based on the yield curve's -70bps level today), likely causing BND to lose about 12% of its value based on its duration risk. The ""yield-curve"" risk factor in BND is tied to the ""inflation risk"" factor detailed above; however, if the curve steepens while the inflation outlook increases, BND  lose around 20% of its value as its yield rises by ~3% or more.Overall, I remain bearish on BND and believe it will continue to lose value over the coming year. My core thesis, as it has since , continues to be that the market is underpricing inflation risks - due to a generally poor understanding of inflation from most economic analysts, including . In my opinion, most understand inflation based on outdated economic models made <1980. Since then, the expansion of technology in the supply chain has caused inflation to be more commodity supply-sensitive (as machines replace human labor), meaning the Fed's ability to influence inflation with interest rates is much lower than they believe. It also means the relationship between unemployment and inflation is  to be (Phillips curve).This issue creates a bearish potential for BND and stocks, which may be overpriced due to the ""bad news is good news"" relationship between economic data and interest rate reduction hopes. Assuming lower economic demand does not mean lower inflation (for the reasons above), bad news is bad news because poor economic data will not promote the same level of disinflation as it had in decades past. Indeed, a slower economy may  inflation because it may push the US dollar's value lower, increasing import costs - a significant issue since the  expanded dramatically.

Marathon Petroleum: Investing In The Fossil Fuel 'Supernova',"The US oil and gas sector has faced significant volatility, with little-to-no correlation to the S&P 500 over most of the past three years. The sharp rise in oil and gas prices in 2021, led by production cuts the year prior, caused most inMarathon Petroleum has significantly outperformed the general energy ETF (The crack spread has been abnormally high in recent years for various reasons. It also rose rapidly over recent weeks due to refinery outages and a and diesel stockpiles. Accordingly, those two energy commodities have risen in value compared to crude oil, which has also increased in recent weeks. See below:The gasoline spread has been generally elevated since the initial refinery issues in 2020, but has never returned to its pre-COVID levels due to ongoing refinery capacity shortfalls. The diesel spread was high last year due to the acute shortage of diesel fuel. Although that spread declined considerably after, it has begun to rise again due to signs that the deficit will likely return.In my view, the situation facing refining margins and profits on other downstream energy segments makes companies like Marathon particularly interesting today. MPC is hovering around its peak value but trades at a lower forward ""P/E"" of 6.9X, indicating it could be discounted today. Of course, the downstream sector also faces economic, technological, and regulatory risks, which could offset its significant pricing power and tremendous moat. The company faces numerous complex factors; however, I believe its short-term outlook is solid, with decent potential over the coming years. Of course, the company will likely need to make more significant green energy transition investments in the long run. Still, those may never drive substantial profits for well over a decade. Accordingly, I expect MPC will benefit tremendously from the lack of investment in ""legacy"" oil and gas until then.Marathon's earnings  to lower refining margins that quarter, primarily driven by the low diesel crack spread. In Q3, its earnings outlook is much stronger due to the recent spread improvement, with both showing a strong upward trend. However, one of the company's major refinery plants will be  due to a recent fire, pushing its capacity utilization down to 93% from 100%. Of course, this issue is a double-edged sword because it contributes to the lack of available refining capacity pushing the crack spread higher. Across the industry, refinery capacity utilization is around 93% today (a standard level), but total capacity is still significantly depressed. See below:The decline in total refinery capacity is the primary reason for the increase in refining profits, creating a chronic shortage of refined products due to a lack of production and high demand. This was triggered by a large wave of refinery . Refinery shutdowns or production issues will likely continue to grow as no new refineries have . As the country looks to shift toward electric vehicles,  due to the immense costs, low projected lifespan of refining projects, and increased regulatory burden outlook.One company is looking to build a , which will be completed in 2027; however, it will not add much to total production (129 refineries). I expect that project  (and shortages). The labor and materials shortage is a significant secondary issue limiting capacity expansion and utilization. After that, the sharp increase in interest rates limits these companies' willingness to borrow money to expand and strongly encourages a return of invested capital. This trend is evident in Marathon Petroleum, which has slashed the CapEx budget (despite high profits), and substantially increased its cash-flow returns. See below:""Cash from financing"" are net cash-flows from dividends, stock buybacks, debt repayments (being negative), and stock and debt sales (being positive). When compared to Enterprise Value ($79B for MPC), it gives us a ""true"" dividend yield for the company as a whole (not just its equity). That figure is currently a staggering 19% for MPC, meaning at its current pace, it could buy back all of its debt and equity in about five years. Of course, MPC's ability to return cash highly depends on its refining margins, as that is the most variable part of its . More importantly, the sharp change in Marathon's focus from capital investing to return on capital shows the company is not looking to expand and is instead paying back its investors - a great sign for investors. The same trend is seen across the oil and gas sector, with virtually all larger companies halting most CapEx instead of capital returns, indicating a widespread unwillingness to expand into the (theoretically) limited lifespan environment (given the rise of electric vehicles).If the refinery market continues to see low production levels, which I strongly suspect, then there is a significant probability of a sharper increase in gasoline and diesel prices. One major catalyst is the lower inventories of these commodities and the rising fuel export level. Many other countries face similar issues to the US, mainly Europe, which was previously dependent on Russian fuel. As demand for US exports grows amid depressed refinery production, fuel inventories may fall to critically low levels and cause another significant price spike like that seen in diesel last year. See below:Overall, I believe the current situation points to a potentially large increase in refining profits, led by a sharp rise in diesel and gasoline prices compared to crude oil. Low inventories of those two critical commodities, volatile production after summer, and rising export demand could bring a more considerable shortage than last year's diesel shortage. As hurricane season nears, the potential for a black-swan decline in is very high, possibly creating a larger temporary production decline that pushes the shortage to an extreme.I believe MPC is an excellent way for investors to bet on increased gasoline prices. Indeed, it is also a means to hedge against a rise in fuel costs, a significant ongoing risk for most companies and the economy today. Marathon offers thepotential of a sharp acute rise in refining profits, which I suspect could occur over the coming months. The stock also appears attractive over the 3-7 year horizon, as fuel demand may be substantially higher than supply over that timeframe due to underinvestment across the industry. Eventually, the associated increase in fuel costs should accelerate the transition toward electric vehicles, likely causing MPC to lose. After that, the company can still sell chemical products, around 10-15% of total oil consumption today; however, its total profits should be much lower after the transition.I believe MPC's most significant long-term value opportunity is the possibility that the energy transition will take longer than expected. Marathon, and its major peers, are acting as if it will occur very quickly, rapidly reducing investments and returning capital today. However, should fossil fuel demand , the chronic shortage today could become far more significant. In my view, this situation makes MPC a ""Supernova"" investment, where it could see extremely high cash flows for years before its eventual demise (of its fossil fuel segment, but not its much smaller chemical segment). Given the US power grid must be expanded significantly before a  combined with utility , fossil fuels may dominate for longer than expected, extending the size of this ""supernova.""The difference between Marathon and its peers Valero () and Phillips 66 () is insignificant. MPC's valuation is between the two, with a forward ""EV/EBITDA"" of 4.7X vs. PSX at 5.8X and VLO and 3.9X. However, their three-year out-forward valuations are closer, with three-year forward ""P/E"" of 12.3X compared to MPC at 12X. That indicates Valero's EPS will likely decline faster than MPC and PSX. Marathon is larger and has a higher operating margin of 10.4% compared to both of its peers. Thus, I believe Marathon has the best potential to maintain production over the coming years and reinvest  after the energy transition is complete. As such, MPC is my favorite stock in the group, but I am also bullish on PSX and VLO.The most significant long-term risk for Marathon is a more rapid increase in the utilization of electric vehicles. Currently, the EV market is a bit cold, with sales lower than likely due to economic strains on  workers. For the EV transition to occur more quickly, interest rates on consumer loans would need to be lower, discretionary income higher (or EV prices much lower), and fossil fuel prices would likely need to be higher. All those factors are possible, but today's specific environment does not encourage a rapid EV transition. Indeed, I believe the transition may be slower than most expect.Marathon also faces short-term risks, particularly with the stock reaching a new record peak. While I am moderately bullish on MPC, a short-term pullback may occur simply due to its recent breakout. A sharp economic slowdown could also harm gasoline consumption, pushing crack spreads and refining profits back down. That is a distinct possibility today; however has been highly resilient despite economic and price strains since late 2021, so a recession may not harm gasoline consumption as much as it did in the past. A recession would likely further break refinery capacity, probably increasing the sector's total ""supernova"" potential. While MPC faces distinct short- and long-term risks, it also offers tremendous immediate value and is a strong hedge against today's most considerable inflationary strains.

HighPeak Energy: Successfully Refinances Its Debt,"HighPeak Energy () has successfully refinanced its debt, pushing its next debt maturity (based on the springing maturity of its existing credit facility) out by around three years with a new .This givesThe rig restrictions do have the benefit of forcing HighPeak to spend less on capex and focus on generating more free cash flow, which it should be able to do decently with $80s oil.I believe HighPeak is roughly fairly pricedHighPeak successfully refinanced its debt by entering into a term loan agreement with a $1.2 billion commitment capacity. This term loan matures in September 2026 and carries an interest rate of SOFR + 7.5%. The term loan has a first-lien security interest in substantially all of HighPeak's assets.With SOFR at around 5.3%, the term loan's current interest rate would be 12.8%, which is quite high for first-lien debt.HighPeak is using the proceeds from the term loan to repay its 10% unsecured notes due February 2024, its 10.625% unsecured notes due November 2024 and its existing credit facility borrowings (maturing in June 2024, but with a springing maturity to October 2023).At the end of Q2 2023, HighPeak had $970 million in net debt, although with no working capital deficit its net debt would be closer to $1.25 billion. Proforma for its July equity offering, its net debt with no working capital deficit would be approximately $1.1 billion.HighPeak will likely continue to carry at least some working capital deficit and it mentioned that it is now generating positive free cash flow, so its $1.2 billion term loan should give it sufficient (albeit limited) liquidity, given that the term loan also imposes restrictions on how many active drilling rigs it can have.HighPeak is also allowed to enter into a super senior revolving credit facility for up to $100 million.HighPeak mentioned that it was adding a third drilling rig to take advantage of strong oil prices, but it will soon (in 2024) be limited to no more than two drilling rigs (outside of obligation wells) as long as its net leverage is 1.0x or higher. If its net leverage is between 0.75x to 1.0x, then it is allowed to have three drilling rigs.At current strip, HighPeak seems likely to be restricted to two drilling rigs into mid-to-late 2024, but should get its net leverage below 1.0x during 2H 2024. It may be able to get its net leverage below 0.75x by the end of 2024 at current strip, potentially allowing it to increase its rig count above three.I've modeled a scenario below where HighPeak runs a two-rig drilling program through most of 2024 and spends $600 million on capex. In this scenario HighPeak will likely see its production fall a bit from its 2023 exit rate (with guidance midpoint currently at 57,000 BOEPD).Thus I am currently modeling HighPeak's 2024 production at 53,000 BOEPD (83% oil) with the belief that it will exit 2024 with around 50,000 BOEPD in production if it continues with a two-rig drilling program. However, there is significant uncertainty around HighPeak's production levels due to its large number of recent wells and currently high base decline rate.At the current strip of $82 WTI oil for 2024, HighPeak may generate $1.382 billion in oil and gas revenues before hedges.HighPeak's 2024 hedges (from the end of Q2 2023) have approximately negative $14 million in value. This doesn't include the new hedges that HighPeak will add soon (if it hasn't done so already).As shown above, HighPeak is now required (as part of its term loan agreement) to enter into oil hedges covering at least 27,000 barrels per day in oil production for the twelve month period ending September 2024, with a floor price that is at least 85% of strip.I am modeling HighPeak's 2024 lease operating expenses (including workover expense) at $9.00 per BOE at 53,000 BOEPD in average production. HighPeak's cash interest costs may end up at around $146 million if it only makes its $30 million per quarter in scheduled repayments. It may be able to reduce its interest costs with accelerated repayments.This results in a projection of $354 million in 2024 free cash flow at low-$80s WTI oil and modest production declines.HighPeak also has $13 million in annual dividend payments at its current quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share. It is also required to make $120 million per year in term loan repayments.HighPeak estimated that its proved developed reserves had a PV-10 of $2.81 billion at $80 oil. This was based on estimated reserves from the beginning of August 2023.At $16.75 per share, HighPeak's market cap would be approximately $2.5 billion assuming that its outstanding options and warrants were exercised. It would have approximately 149 million shares outstanding along with $850 million in net debt. This $3.35 billion combined total is nearly 1.2x HighPeak's proved developed PV-10 at $80 oil. At $80s oil, HighPeak should be able to increase its proved developed reserves while also reducing its debt.I previously estimated HighPeak's value at $13 per share in a long-term $75 oil and $3.75 gas scenario. I've increased its estimated value to $14 per share with long-term (after 2024) $75 WTI oil. This increase is due to higher near-term oil prices as well as the improved stability of HighPeak's finances.At long-term $80 WTI oil instead, I'd consider HighPeak's current share price of around $16.75 per share to be roughly fair. HighPeak's insiders have  at around its current share price, but I tend to take a more conservative view towards longer-term oil prices.HighPeak Energy successfully refinanced its debt and it now has three years until its new $1.2 billion term loan matures. It is paying close to 13% interest on that term loan though, and is also required to make $120 million per year in term loan repayments.At $80s oil, HighPeak should be able to make significant progress in reducing its net debt and leverage though. It will be restricted in terms of the number of active drilling rigs it can have until it reduces its leverage below 0.75x.I believe that HighPeak is currently fairly valued for a long-term $80 WTI oil scenario and is worth approximately $14 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil instead.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Black Stone Minerals: The 11% Yield Appears Sustainable In Current Environment," () is expecting slightly higher production levels in 2H 2023, including higher oil cuts. This should allow it to achieve 1.1x distribution coverage during the second half of the year at current strip prices.Due to weaker hedges in 2024, there is a good chance that Black Stone's distribution coverage falls slightly below 1.0x in 2024 based on current strip prices ($77 WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX gas).However, I'd expect Black Stone to maintain its quarterly distribution at $0.475 per unit in that scenario since it has a good amount of positive working capital and no long-term debt.I am  of Black Stone's value at $18.50 to $19.00 per unit at long-term prices of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. This allows for a bit of capital gain potential for Black Stone's units, while itBlack Stone reported  (74% natural gas) in total production for Q2 2023, with 93% of that production being mineral and royalty production and 7% being working interest production.This was an 8% decrease from the approximately 39,300 BOEPD (78% natural gas) in average production that it reported in Q1 2023. During that quarter, 94% of Black Stone's production was from its mineral and royalty interests.Black Stone's production declined sequentially mainly due to lower Haynesville volumes as NYMEX natural gas prices only averaged a bit over $2 during Q2 2023, while  for many Haynesville operators is estimated at around $3. This has resulted in a slowdown in development activity there, while  that it also had naturally declining production from several high-interest (and high initial production) Haynesville wells that went online in 2H 2022.Due to the change in mix, the value (independent of commodity prices) of Black Stone's production only decreased by approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter despite total volumes decreasing by 8%.Black Stone maintained its quarterly distribution at $0.475 per unit. Despite lower commodity prices and lower total production volumes, Black Stone's distributable cash flow was nearly the same in Q2 2023 as its was in Q1 2023. Black Stone reported $0.496 per unit in distributable cash flow in Q1 2023 and $0.493 per unit in distributable cash flow in Q2 2023, resulting in distribution coverage of approximately 1.04x in both quarters.Black Stone's increased oil production helped offset lower oil prices during the quarter, so its oil revenues were still up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues for natural gas and NGLs were down 28% quarter-over-quarter due to the combination of lower prices and lower production volumes. However, Black Stone had hedges covering 56% of its natural gas production and 64% of its oil production in Q2 2023. Black Stone had a realized gain of $28.2 million from its hedge settlements in Q2 2023, compared to a $13.3 million realized gain in Q1 2023.Black Stone continues to expect to average 37,000 to 39,000 BOEPD in production for 2023. It expects slightly more gas in its full-year production though, and has thus increased its guidance around the natural gas percentage from 72% to 74%.To get to the midpoint of Black Stone's full-year guidance, it would need to average approximately 38,300 BOEPD (72% natural gas) in production during the second half of the year. Production during 2H 2023 would be 2% higher than the first half, with oil making up 28% of total production (compared to 24% in 1H 2023).Black Stone believes that volumes coming online from various Permian wells (along with recent high-interest Bakken wells) will help drive the increased oil percentage in the second half of the year.Based on the current strip for the second half of 2023, Black Stone is projected to generate $288 million in revenues after hedges. Black Stone's 2H 2023 hedges have approximately $38 million in value at current strip.Black Stone is thus projected to generate $220 million in distributable cash flow in 2H 2023, or $1.05 per unit.This would be 1.1x distribution coverage if Black Stone maintains its quarterly distribution at $0.475 per unit. The increased distribution coverage is driven by the expectation of higher production volumes and oil cuts during the second half of the year.One thing to note is that Black Stone's preferred units currently have a 7% annual distribution rate. This will be repriced in November 2023 based on the 10-year Treasury Rate + 5.5%, which would be approximately 9.5% at this time. That would add $7.5 million per year to Black Stone's preferred distributions.I have taken a look at Black Stone's potential 2024 results if its production averages 38,300 BOEPD (72% natural gas), which is similar to 2H 2023 expectations.At current 2024 strip of approximately $77 WTI oil and $3.50 Henry Hub gas, Black Stone would be projected to generate $510 million in revenues after hedges.Black Stone's 2024 hedges are at a lower price than its 2023 hedges. Black Stone's 2023 hedges were mostly at $80.80 oil and $5.15 gas. The 2024 hedges are at $68.98 oil and $3.57 gas.The weaker hedges and increased preferred distributions result in Black Stone's distributable cash flow ending up at $1.78 per unit for 2024 if it averages 38,300 BOEPD production at current strip. This results in 0.94x distribution coverage.At current 2024 strip and a 5% increase in production (to approximately 40,200 BOEPD with 72% natural gas), Black Stone's distribution coverage would end up at around 0.99x with a $0.475 per unit quarterly distribution.Black Stone's 2024 hedges have a negative 0.03x impact on distribution coverage, so without its hedges distribution coverage would be 0.97x and 1.02x in the two scenarios mentioned above.I believe that Black Stone is likely going to maintain its quarterly distribution at $0.475 per unit in the current environment.I continue to value Black Stone at $18.50 to $19.00 per unit based on my long-term commodity prices of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas.At its current $17.35 unit price, Black Stone currently offers an 11% yield, and that distribution appears to be sustainable, albeit with distribution coverage hovering around 1.0x at strip.Black Stone Minerals should see improved distributable cash flow in 2H 2023, due to increased production expectations (particularly for oil). However, its hedges for 2024 are noticeably worse than its 2023 hedges, so it may end up with 2024 distribution coverage slightly under 1.0x at current strip.I expect Black Stone to maintain its quarterly distribution at $0.475 per unit, as its distribution coverage should be very close to 1.0x during the next year and a half at current strip and 38,300 BOEPD in average production.This would give it a roughly 11% yield at its current unit price, along with the potential for a modest amount of capital appreciation.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tingo Group Chief Executive Officer, Darren Mercer. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator, and good morning everybody. I am pleased to welcome you to today's Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Despite the challenges we haveFor those of you joining us for the first time, I would like to take a moment to introduce Tingo Group. Tingo Group is a diverse fintech and agri-fintech group of companies with operations in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. We significantly expanded and somewhat transformed the company when we acquired 100% of Tingo Mobile Limited on November the 30th of 2022, and then acquired Tingo Foods PLC on February 7, 2023 before subsequently changing our name to Tingo Group, Inc., on February 27, 2023.As of today, the Tingo Group is comprised of the following businesses, Tingo Mobile, which is a leading fintech and agri-fintech business in Africa that operates through a device as a service and smartphone, USSD platform model. Tingo Foods, which off takes crops from the Tingo Mobile substantial and growing customer base of farmers and processes those crops into finished food and beverage products.Tingo DMCC, which operates a commodity trading platform and export business from the Dubai Multi Commodity Center, and deals in both raw agricultural commodities from our Tingo Mobile farmers and finished food products and Tingo Foods. TingoPay, which has developed and recently begin to operate a beta version of the TingoPay Super-App supported by our Panafric partnership with Visa. The full version of TingoPay, which will be rolled out later this year provides payment services, and eWallet, and a range of value-added services to customers. TingoPay in partnership with Visa also offers a range of merchant services to businesses. We also have a number of fintech verticals that have today been focused on the Southeast Asia markets within the past few months however, as we focus on maximizing shareholder value and leveraging the most profitable and value parts of the Tingo Group, we are currently restructuring this part of the business on winding down or disposing of any operations that do not achieve our target contribution metrics. Our group of businesses and synergistic ecosystem they create places us in a remarkable position from which we can expand both in our current markets and internationally and deliver significant further growth. Despite the challenges I mentioned earlier, which we believe are temporary and short-term issues that will ultimately benefit the company in the long-term. We achieved quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter of 14.8%. What is important to note is that this was against a backdrop of a 66.3% devaluation of Nigeria's currency during the second quarter. And a period of economic stagnation in Nigeria following its government elections and subsequent change in presidential administrations.It is worth noting that the significant devaluation of Nigeria's currency occurred as a result of the Central Bank of Nigeria's removal of foreign exchange restrictions, which we believe will deliver significant long-term benefits to our business, including the acceleration of the dollarization of our business and making our export and commodity trading activities more profitable. Furthermore, wants the policies of Nigeria's new government have been fully implemented, we do expect Nigeria's currency to appreciate and its economy to rebound strongly, which should be hugely beneficial to the company and our shareholders.Following the completion of our acquisition of Tingo Mobile on November 30, 2022, we have been highly profitable and continue to grow strongly since including through the subsequent acquisition of Tingo Foods and the commencement of export trades through Tingo DMCC. We have also achieved organic growth, including through our partnership with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria and our launch into Ghana.This growth is set to continue following the delivery of 6 million new handsets that we plan to distribute to new AFAN customers. Our financial results highlight for the group is shown on this slide. Once again, our representative of our strong financial performance since the completion of our acquisition of Tingo Mobile on November 30, 2022 and our subsequent acquisition of Tingo Foods.The quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company generated over $977 million in revenue, $346 million in gross profit, $283 million in EBITDA, and nearly $182 million in income before tax. Furthermore, our high levels of operational cash flow enabled us to invest just under $1 billion in the quarter on purchasing 6 million mobile phone handsets for distribution to new customers and on inventory payments for both Tingo Foods and Tingo DMCC businesses. Slide 5, our mission. As mentioned previously, our reason why Tingo Group is very important to us. And those of you that have listened to or read our presentations will most likely already be aware of our mission statements. For those of you not familiar, our overarching mission at Tingo Group is to foster digital and financial inclusion through our fintech platforms and to drive social and economic upliftment. In our Agri-Fintech businesses, our mission includes our commitment to make a significant difference in improving global food supply and tackling the world's food security crisis by delivering farmer empowerments, improved crop yields, a reduction in post-harvest losses, and better access to both foreign and domestic markets. At a regional level, we also aim to support our Africa and its farmers to achieve sustainable food, self-sufficiency, bringing an end to Africa's food insecurity and poverty. Slide 6, acquisition and recent developments. By way of a recap, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Tingo Mobile on May 10, 2022. Following on this, we immediately appointed a team of some of the world's largest and most reputable professional advisors to undertake extensive due diligence and financial analysis. Amongst others, the team included before accounting firm, a number one U.S. law firm who was the largest in Africa, and as said, other professional advisors too. We announced on June 15, 2022, that the due diligence exercise had been completed and that the findings were positive with no material concerns. The original merger agreement was amended and restated in October of 2022 to facilitate the expedited acquisition of 100% of Tingo Mobile as well as an improvement in the terms for the company's shareholders. The acquisition was subsequently completed on November 30, 2022. With the benefit of the company's in Tingo Mobile's collaboration, the fourth quarter of 2022 marked the beginning of the geographical expansion of Tingo Mobile with the opening of offices in Ghana, Malawi, and Dubai. The fourth quarter also saw us launch the Tingo DMCC commodities trading platform and export business, and the soft launch of the beta version of the TingoPay Super-App in partnership with Visa. By January of 2023, we began to pivot the company's insurance and fintech verticals to better complement the Tingo businesses with the goal of leveraging its already established brands and larger customer base. Then on February 7, 2023, we acquired the Tingo Foods and beverage processing business to further strengthen the Tingo seed-to-sale ecosystem. Also, on February 27, 2023, we changed our corporate name and ticker symbol to better reflect the importance of the Tingo brand to the business and provide improved clarity to our external stakeholders, including current and prospective partners, customers, and investors. Our reporting of full 2022 financial results on March 31, of 2023, was followed in April by the announcement of Tingo Mobile exclusive partnership agreements with PCX and AFAN. On May 30th, we completed our first commodity export trades through Tingo DMCC marking a major milestone in our strategy to dollarize the company's net earnings. Lastly, earlier today we announced the commencement of a quarterly dividend payable to the holders of both our common stock and Series B convertible preferred shares and the adoption of a dividend policy. The first dividend payment has provisionally been agreed in the amount of $20 million, which we aim to set the record date for as soon as practicable and will classify it as relating to our second quarter results. By way of the reopen update on the Tingo Mobile business that I founded over 22 years ago. We begin with the Tingo Mobile business as a service model, and then North USSD fintech platform, which we believe is a leading Agri-Fintech platform in Africa. Following the signing of updated definitive measure agreement with MICT in October of 2022, we set about accelerating our growth strategy. In November and December of 2022, we signed trade agreements with two major partners, with the aim of quickly expanding Tingo mobile's customer base from 9.3 million to unexpected 30 million.We signed a partnership with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, which included a commitment to enroll a minimum of 20 million new customers to Tingo Mobile. We also launched in Ghana and signed a trade agreement with the Kingdom of Ashanti, which included a commitment to enroll a minimum of 2 million new customers to Tingo Mobile and the target goal of enrolling more than 4 million new customers.Soon afterwards, we launched into Malawi and have made progress towards several trade partnerships. With the goal of establishing a base to roll out in the future across East Africa, including Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia. Looking further ahead, we plan to expand in the future into other parts of Africa as well as into Asia and other relevant markets in the world.Through our businesses within the Tingo family, namely Tingo Foods and Tingle DMCC, we aim to increase offtake and demand of produce from Tingo Mobile's farmers, thereby creating a virtual self-reinforcement cycle. In April, 2023, as part of the further strengthening of our ecosystem, Tingo Mobile entered into an interpreted agreement with PCX and AFAN, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.Lastly, as we look to expand the reach of our NWASSA marketplace platform. We are making good progress in testing and further developing the forthcoming NWASSA web platform and NWASSA app, which we intend to launch later this year to complement the already successful USSD GSM platform.Slide 8, Tingo Foods. Tingo Foods was acquired by the group on February 7, 2023. This is a business that Dozy Mmobuosi had been developing for some time outside of Tingo Mobile. Tingo Foods was launched as a standalone company in September of 2022, focusing on supplying a relatively small range of products to several large distribution and wholesale businesses.Tingo Foods create significant demand and offtake for Tingo Mobile's farmers, while at the same time creating supply for Tingo DMCC commodity trading and export business. In the first five months of trading, since we acquired Tingo Foods PLC in February of 2023, the business has generated revenues of $983.7 million and delivered an operating profit of $203.8 million. The U.S. dollar conversion of the revenues and earnings of Tingo Foods was adversely impacted by the significant devaluation of Nigeria's currency against the U.S. dollar in June of 2023 when the Central Bank of Nigeria removed certain foreign exchange restrictions.We believe that these actions will ultimately be beneficial for the company. Including helping to accelerate the dollarization of the business and for the growth and profit margins of our export business. The Tingo Foods business was also impacted by the economic stagnation in Nigeria that ensued around the time of the change in presidential administration, which resulted in several customers delaying orders. Tingo Foods is set to multiply capacity and revenue with a new state-of-the-art $1.6 billion food processing facility in the Delta state of Nigeria. Our joint venture construction partner has confirmed the project is on track to enable Tingo Foods to commence processing operations on site by mid-2024. On February 22, 2023, Tingo Foods signed a partnership with Evtec Energy PLC to build a $150 million, 110 megawatt solar plants to power the facility, which aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions and deliver reduced energy cost. We believe Africa's farmers and agricultural sector will benefit from the significant expansion of the continent's own processing capabilities, increasing crop demand, reducing post-harvest losses, ensuring fairer selling prices for farmers, and delivering financial upliftment. Slide 9, Tingo DMCC, Agri Commodity Platform. In December 2022, we launched Tingo DMCC, which is an agricultural commodity platform and export business in partnership with the Dubai Multi Commodity Center, the DMCC. As part of the Tingo ecosystem, Tingo DMCC is already becoming a significant source of offtake of raw crops from Tingo Mobile's farmers, and is also expected to be a major customer for Tingo Foods in the future as it looks to export their finished food and beverage products. Having spent several months working with AFAN and their farmers on the aggregation of bulk volumes of produce, we completed our first export trades on May 30, 2023, and delivered $348 million of export revenues in the second quarter, through the farmers of Nigeria, which are estimated to total around 60 million. With the addition of Ghana, Malawi, and certain other territories in the future, we now have access to several billion U.S. dollars per annum of agricultural produce for our export business. Furthermore, our exclusive partnership with PCX and AFAN, which strengthens our supply chain and good handling capabilities and gives us priority access to the PCX commodity trading platform is already proving to be valuable as we develop the business and build a strong foundation. The Tingo DMCC export business is expected to Dollarize and globalize Tingo Group, whilst at the same time providing Tingo Mobile's farmers and Tingo Foods direct access to international markets. Slide 10 PCX and AFAN. On April 26, 2023, it was announced that Tingo Mobile had partnered with PCX and AFAN. For the exclusive use of AFAN's existing network of 2,322 warehouses across Nigeria for a minimum term of 30 years. The strategic partnership uniquely positions Tingo to monetize Nigeria's crop ecosystem across its population of 213 million and the global export market.Under the terms of the agreement, Tingo Mobile has the right of first refusal to purchase or trade any of the produce stored in the AFAN warehouses, which it intends to use primarily to serve the Tingo Foods food processing business and the Tingo DMCC commodity trading and export business. PCX has installed its leading-edge E warehouse receipt system in all of the partnerships warehouses, enabling crops, and other produce to be commoditized and traded by Tingo from the date of delivery.Tingo Mobile is also to be granted a priority position on the PCX commodity trading platform, enabling Tingo DMCC to trade, farming, produce, and other commodities on spot futures, physical, and derivative basis. AFAN the umbrella body for Nigeria's farming sector has committed to coordinate all of its agricultural cooperatives and members to utilize the partnership warehouses to handle their produce. In addition, the partnership has committed to a targeted increase in the number of warehouses to 80,000 over the next two years.Tingo Mobile also has the right to sublet the warehouse space to pre-approved third parties such as e-commerce businesses and wholesale businesses. As mentioned previously, this partnership with AFAN and PCX is expected to considerably increase our offtake of crops and other produce from farmers, which we believe will help to satisfy the substantial future input requirements of our food processing and commodity trading and export business.Importantly, the agreements also further augments our seed to sale model, helping us to achieve our objectives of reducing post-harvest losses and crop wastage, whilst also increasing food production levels and meaningfully improving food security.For those of you joining us for the first time, Single Pay, which is currently being tested in data version, is a super app that offers a full range of value-added services and partnership with Visa. Such services include a Digital Visa card, e-wallet payment services, marketplace, e-commerce, insurance and finance. As a full market B2C and B2B offering the Tingo Pay Super app and Visa partnership is helping us to diversify and expand Tingo Group into new sectors.With the aim of making Tingo Pay and Tingo household names as widely recognized as desire itself. To assist us in achieving market penetration, our Pan-Africa partnership with Visa includes their provision of marketing and customer acquisition support.SMEs in all business sectors will benefit from a new range of Tingo Visa merchant services and the Tingo Pay business portal. And our smallholder farmer customers will see significant additional advantages. Through the integration of Tingo Pay with NWASSA Agri Marketplace platform. The Tingo Pay business portal and Tingo Visa Merchant Services enables subscribers, farmers, and businesses in all sectors to easily and securely accept payments and to make online transactions in their domestic or foreign currencies.As well as to manage the card set up recurring payments and access transaction statements. The test in EBITDA version of the Tingo Pay app is progressing well. As the technical development team is constantly making improvements ahead of its rollout. Such improvements include the addition of new functions and several new value-added services. Our current target is to launch the full-scale single pay by the end of the third quarter.In Tingo Mobile, and Wassa, TingoPay, Tingo Foods, and Tingo DMCC, we have created a full agri-fintech ecosystem, which is at the very heart of our business. We communicate with and push services to our farmers through the smartphone handsets, we supply to them. The farmers can then use [indiscernible] to purchase inputs for their farming business, to purchase other services, to make payments, and to sell their produce. Tingo Foods forms an important part of the ecosystem as both a valuable customer and a source of offtake, at Tingo Mobile's farmers. Processing their raw crops into finished food and beverage products. Finally, Tingo DMCC is in a position to trade and export both the raw crops of Tingo Mobile's farmers and the finished food and beverage products of Tingo Foods, which it is able to sell into a global market where demand significantly outstrips supply. This already strong seed to sale ecosystem is now strengthened further by the recently signed deal between Tingo Mobile of PCX and AFAN. The partnership provides us access to a substantial nationwide network of warehouse facilities, as well as securing a considerable increase in produce supply and offering us enhanced commodity trading opportunities. In total, the Tingo ecosystem creates a reinforcing loop of financial and digital inclusion alongside an increase in food supply and a reduction in post-harvest losses, which in turn improves food security and reduce food poverty. Ultimately, these factors deliver financial and social upliftment not only to our farmers, but also to our stakeholders. Slide 13, environment, social, and government. At the center of everything we do are our core values and our commitment to our environmental, social, and governance goals. We foster digital and financial inclusion through our technology platforms, driving the social and economic upliftment of our customers. We meaningfully improve the global food supply and help tackle the world's food security crisis by empowering the farmer, helping them increase crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses, gain from improved access to markets, and benefit from fairer pricing. Our technology and platforms also deliver significant environmental benefits, reducing crop wastage, improving farming and food production efficiency, promoting sustainable farming techniques, and reducing freight miles. As part of our commitment towards the environment and social upliftment, we are focused on adopting a mature ESG framework, underpinned and guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. I will now turn the call over to Tingo Group CFO, Kevin Chen, to discuss our second quarter 2023 financial results as reported in this morning's 10-Q filing. Thank you, Darren. I'm very pleased to present our financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023. A full breakdown of our financial results is available in our regulatory filing and in the press release that crossed the wire earlier this morning.Before going into numbers, it is important to note the significant impact of the acquisition of Tingo Foods, which closed on February 2023, and has resulted in the consolidation of Tingo Foods' financial results into our own from the date of completion. In other words, the results of Tingo Group for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, include the results of Tingo Foods for approximately two months.Now, turning to some of the key figures. Net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2023, were $1.83 billion, compared to $21.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 8,396%. The increase is mainly attributable to the addition of Tingo Mobile and the Tingo Foods exhibition completed on December 1, 2022, and February 9, 2023, respectively. And the commencement of exported trades through Tingo DMCC in May, 2023.Gross profit over the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $732.9 million or 40% of the revenues, compared to $3.3 million or 15.5% of revenues. Over six months ended June 30, 2022, the increase is mainly executed to the addition of Tingo Mobile and Tingo Foods acquisitions completed on December 1, 2022, and February 9, 2023, respectively, and the commencement of export trades for Tingo DMCC in May 2023.Selling and marketing expenses for the six months and dated June 30, 2023, were $174.2 million as compared to $3.5 million for the six months end June 30, 2022. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $53.0 million, compared to $21.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Mainly executed to the addition of cost from Tingo Mobile and Tingo Foods.Operating profit for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $442.4 million versus operating loss of $23.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase being mainly attributed to the acquisitions of Tingo Mobile and the Tingo Foods and the commencement of export treat through Tingo DMCC as explained above. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $273.2 million, compared to a net loss of $23.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of 2023 was $655.3 million, compared to consolidated EBITDA loss of $21.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Tingo Group invested heavily in the growth of Tingo Mobile, Tingo Foods, and Tingo DMCC during the quarter, including making an upfront payment of $434.2 million on the purchase of 6 million handsets for the new AFAN customers. Preparing AFAN for the produced for Tingo Foods and settling their brought forward payables resulting in the total net outlay of $336.1 million and a self-funding stock purchases of $225.8 million for Tingo DMCC's export sales. The revenue for which are scheduled to be received during the third quarter. In addition, tax payments totaling $174.0 million were made for Tingle Mobile on its tax, both earnings for fiscal year 2022, and the company also incurred a loss on foreign exchange. As a result, the balance of cash and cash equivalence at June 30, 2023, decreased to $53.2 million compared to $76.1 million at of the June 30, 2022. Earlier today, we announced the commencement of quarterly dividends payable to the holders of both of common stock and the Series B convertible preferred shares. The first dividend payment has provisionally been agreed in the amount of $20 million, which we aim to set the record date for as soon as practicable and will classify as leading to our second quarter results. Our goal is to increase the amount of quarterly dividends as we grow our earnings and cash balances.

I'll now hand the call back to Darren. Thank you, Kevin. My board and I believe Tingo Group continues to be uniquely and strongly positioned both as a company and as an attractive investment proposition. We are a fast-growth and highly profitable NASDAQ-listed company, having generated revenues of $1.83 billion and earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of $655.3 million in the first half of 2023. You have a strong balance sheet and our operations are significantly cash flow positive. Earlier today, we announced the commencement of quarterly dividend payments. We have a high growth, high margin, and sticky revenue model with low customer acquisition cost and lower attrition. We have a full agri and food ecosystem from seed to sale, creating a virtuous circle for both us and our customers. Our food processing and commodity export business has a vast potential and we are making a difference towards addressing the global food shortage and food security crises. And we are a benefactor of price inflation.Our Visa Tingo partnership and Tingo Pay Super App are well-positioned to expand Tingo significantly into new B2C and B2B markets. We have proven proprietary fintech platforms, which are replicable in new geographical markets and new sectors. We have a vast addressable global market and we believe we have a significant ESG impact that can grow considerably further in the future. Thank you everybody.Operator, my colleagues, and I from Tingo, are now ready to take questions from the participants.Our first question asked. Congratulations on another strong quarter for the company and the initiation of a dividend program, which I am delighted to see. You mentioned that you would expect a significant increase in the level of dividend payment in the third quarter, which is also great to hear. Can you explain more on this?Yes, sure. As explained in our results, our CapEx and investment into inventory in Q2 was just under a $1 billion and of course added to which during the course. So, we also paid out our annual tax on Tingo Mobile, of another circa $170 million. But having made all these investments in outlay last quarter, we can now expect the inventory we purchased to be converted back into cash and our export business to fund itself.So, in addition, the 6 million mobile phones we also bought will begin to generate significant revenues and earnings. So, when you take all of that into account and the growth that we expect to deliver in our export business. We expect to be able to significantly increase our dividend payments at Q3 and then again at Q4, and hopefully with increases in each quarter thereafter.It should be remembered that with the new significant number of handsets being deployed from as early as next month, those phones will in turn generate very significant revenues and additional contributions to group profits almost immediately. So, in short, yes, we expect a significant increase in dividends from Q3 onwards. And yes, it's the aim of the company to deliver quarter-on-quarter dividend increases.Thank you, team. The next question asked. While the results are once again very impressive indeed, clearly the floating of the Naira and its devaluation has had a material impact on the results when converted into U.S. dollars. What long-term impact, if any, do you foresee on the company as a result of the new exchange rate going forward?Yes, it’s very good question. I think the first thing to point out is that the Nigerian government's new foreign exchange policy now means that the Naira of earnings that we have or now much more readily exchangeable into U.S. dollars. And this means from this moment forward, our company can now value its Naira cash balance as a liquid U.S. dollar equivalent asset. And furthermore, any valuation discount that was previously applied against our Naira earnings can now be removed.Look, whilst the current devaluation has some negative impacts on the existing Tingo Mobile revenues. The benefits of a freely exchangeable currency is something that we strongly believe outweighed the negatives. And as for those negatives, well they may be short-term in nature anyway, particularly given the new economic policies of Nigeria's government. There's much talk about the recovering large parts of lost ground in valuation terms over the coming months ahead. Furthermore, if I turn to other parts of the business, there are some notable immediate benefits that the devaluation of the Naira brings. I mean, in particular in connection with our export business, where the price of the produce we purchased from Nigeria is significantly reduced, and as such, our produce now has a key price and competitive advantage over produce from other parts of the world. And we're already now seeing the benefits of this. And I'm sure that in the future, as we go forward and as we report future quarters numbers, we very much believe that we will see noticeable increases in our margin of export produce. Thank you, team. The next question asked. I believe it was a major development for Tango's prospects and valuation when Nigeria's new president and its central bank removed certain foreign exchange restrictions on the Naira. Especially bearing in mind that these longstanding restrictions had detrimentally affected the country's economy and investment appeal for so long. Can you comment further on what the lifting of the restrictions means for the company and us as shareholders? Yes. Look, I think I've covered much of that in the previous answer. But again, I think for the benefit of all of our shareholders, we should recognize that for the first time since we acquired Tingo Mobile and Tingo Foods, for the first time we are now able to readily apply to convert our Naira cash balances and earnings into U.S. dollars. Naturally, we need to achieve the right balance of reinvesting a portion of our earnings into further growth and acceleration of the business, just as you've seen us do in Q2, but, we can now also commence to distribute a meaningful portion of our earnings to shareholders as dividends. And I think we've demonstrated that with the initiation of our dividend program today. Thank you, team. The next question asked. The press release statement talks about the purchase of 6 million new phones for AFAN's farmers. I'm interested to know if AFAN already has the demand for these phones, or will it take time to deploy them and start to generate the related earnings? Also, what level of earnings and profitability can we expect from the falls?Quite a lot to answer that. Does that firm have demand for 6 million new phones? Yes, absolutely. In fact, they have considerable pen up demand, which means that, as soon as we can source more handsets, they can be distributed almost immediately. And it's not just we have demand through AFAN in Nigeria, but also through the Ashanti Investment Trust in Ghana. We also have considerable demand too. As to when they'll be deployed. Well, I mentioned it earlier, AFAN, and Tingo will start the process as soon as the phones are delivered. And the great thing is that as soon as those phones are delivered to the customer, they start to generate revenue, not just from the lease payments, but also through the value-added services that we offer on the USSD platform. Of course, with [indiscernible], we earn commissions are, or fees straight away on the transactions that customers make over the platform, and that includes anything from their airtime top-up through the commissions on arranging loans and insurance and even commissions on the agricultural sales and farming inputs. Yes, and enough to the revenues on those phones? Well, at the current exchange rate, the typical average revenue per user or ARPU or per farmer is between $6 and $6.50 a month, of which typically three comes or circa three comes from the lease elements and the balance comes from the NWASSA platform.Now, to give you an idea of what the margin is on those sales on the $3 of lease payments, we are looking at around a 30% margin. And on the $3.50 or thereabouts, so then was the contributions, we're looking at a 98% margin. And so, we're looking at revenues per handset of an excessive $6 and over $4 of what would be gross profit on each of those handsets per month. So not only are these handsets very profitable in their own right, they also connect us to more farmers. And as we look to achieve significant farmers in our platform again through AFAN and Ashanti and whoever and we look to grow that number towards the $30 million by the year-end.We'll now also gain access to considerably more produce. And that produce in turn will support our export business as well as Tingo Foods. I have to say we're really proud of this business model.Thank you, team. The next question asks through today's announcement of the purchase of a further 6 million phones, am I correct in thinking that will take your total number of phones to around 15 million and that you then have another 3 million or so farmers on the NWASSA platform that use their phones? And are there any further plans to increase the number of farmers on your platform beyond the 18 million?Yes, the short answer I guess is yes and yes. And once there's 6 million new mobile phone handsets are delivered to farmers, it will take our number of farmers to around 18 million or so. But I can tell you, and I think we said it today on one or two occasions that our goal is to increase the number of farmers on our platform to 30 million or so by the end of this year. Now, the plans to do this are through our partnership with AFAN in Nigeria who've committed to add 20 million new farmers to the platform, and our partnership with the Ashanti Investment Trust in Ghana, who themselves are committed to add between 2 million and 4 million new farmers this year.I think for those of you who aren't, who AFAN or who AFAN is, this is the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, which is the umbrella body that sits above all of these 56 agriculture and commodity cooperatives in Nigeria. Now, they have a remit from the Nigerian government to ultimately enroll all of the 60 million or so farmers in Nigeria and develop and modernize the country's agricultural sector. And so, they're doing this by improving access to better farming inputs, providing education, delivering access to finance, and so on.And it's their partnership with us, which is most valuable, and which is really focused on making those initiatives a reality. And we're already making a real difference, which in turn we are seeing through results increasing in crop yields, food production levels, and of course reducing post-harvest losses. I mean, I believe such as the extent of our impact that we're not only helping Nigeria's farmers feed their own country, but it's through the initiatives that we have with AFAN, which help us put us in a position to export significant or larger quantities of produce through the rest of continental Africa and to other parts of the world. Thank you, team. From today's results, I can see that the export business of Tingo has generated significant revenues in the first quarter of trading. Is this level of growth sustainable and do you have access to enough produce to satisfy demand? Yes, that's a very good question. I think I said earlier the impacts of the liberation of the exchange rate controls will only make Nigeria's produce even more attractive in international markets. And with our partnerships with AFAN and Ashanti, we aim to fully capitalize on the opportunity we have in front of us. Success in this area will deliver a significant increase in income to our farmers, and the benefit is, of course, in AFAN, that enables them to invest more into their land and their farming inputs, increasing their crop yields and production levels, and thereby creating more produce for us to buy from them. And this is illustrative really of the strength of our ecosystem and the virtuous circle or loop that it creates. The partnership we signed with AFAN and the prime commodity exchange, or PCX, as you've seen, as we refer to it, really enhances and strengthens our position and our ability to grow our export business. Because not only does the partnership give us unrightful logistics and goods handling capabilities in Nigeria, but it also gives us improved access to huge quantities of produce and prime access to the PCX commodity trading platform, which is one of only a number of small commodity exchanges in Nigeria. With more than 12 million farmers currently in our platform, and with 6 million about to be added, rising to 13 million by year-end, our access to substantial quantities of produce, again, puts us in a strong position to grow this area to grow our export business and capitalize on the ever increase in global demand. I think the final point I'll make on this subject is that, at the beginning of June, we made a small announcement that we'd agreed to a loan facility arrangement with AFAN, which will be made available to their farmers and passed on to their farmers to enable them to cultivate new farming land and increase food production levels. I think for people to understand why we did that. As we're all too aware, it's very important for a farmer to know that he or she has reliable access to credit or funding to enable them to purchase the inputs they need for their farming. Now, historically, the Nigerian government would pledge loans to the farming communities, but more often than not, these loans turned up rather late. Now, the impact of that was that the money came in too late for the farmer to be inside to plant their harvest. And now bear, of course, we have to bear in mind that crops are seasonal. So, the program that we've introduced today in partnership with AFAN overcomes that issue. It ensures the farmers receive the necessary funding, and at the appropriate time, and so that all the inputs they purchase are the right ones to grow the right crops for that particular land and the specific conditions that are prevalent in that location. So, with this first loan facility, which we intend to do much more of, we are now able to ensure that thousands of acres of new farming land are cultivated and thousands of additional metric tons of crops are produced each season. So, this not only has a huge positive impact in the lives of the farmers, obviously, but also it further increases the levels of produce that we can access and significantly strengthens our supply chain. So, look, when you put all of these things together, I think we're in a very strong position. And as you can see from the statement today, you know, $340 plus million of revenues in the export division in Q2 rising, we believe to a billion dollars or more of revenue per quarter before the end of this year. Our next question asks, you reported export sales in your Q2 results of $348 million, and that you expect that to increase to $1 billion per quarter in Q3. Are you able to tell us what parts of the world you are now exporting to?Yes. The exports we transacted in Q2 were to other countries in Africa. And whilst we will continue to make exports within the African continent, we're also expanding into other parts of the world, including, primarily including in the Middle East, where demand significantly outstrips local supply. I think, I said earlier that the competitive cost of our produce now, given the devaluation of the Naira is opening up a number of new markets tours in other parts of the world.The next question asks, can you explain in more detail the reason for the significant reduction in the company's cash balance at June 30th, compared to the previous two quarters? My own expectation was actually to see a further increase in cash.Well, that's a question I'm sure most people are interested in. Look, we touched on the explanation already, but I agree. I think it's worth going into a bit more detail. As Kevin mentioned, just a short while ago in his presentation, our investments in outlay into capital expenditure and inventory. During Q2 was approaching a billion dollars, of which $460 million was spent approximately on the new mobile phone handset. And more than $500 million was spent on inventory payments to support both Tingo Foods and our export business.And let's not forget on top of that, we also paid out about $170 million of tax in April on the single mobile profits of 2022. But as Kevin pointed out, whilst cash reserves fell to a little over $50 million at the quarter end, which by the way would've equated close to $90 million on the old exchange rate. Our receivables and the export deals are loan amounted to almost $350 million on the balance sheet.Now all of that flows back into cash during the current quarter, and of course, the outlay to the inventory suppliers for Tingo Foods, which we outlaid at the end of Q2, also has generated a positive cash flow inflow in the third quarter. And as I've said on a number of occasions today, the investment we made into the new mobile phone handsets, it started generating revenues and profits from September. Unless it's not forget the inflow from those mobile phones is something that we expect to see over the next three years on a monthly basis. The next question asks, I know this question has been asked before, but I'm still confused as to why the NWASSA app is on a USSD platform, and it's not a standard app, as you would see in the App Store or Google Play?Okay, let me try and square this circle once and for all. So, look, first thing we need to understand that Nigeria's telecoms and internet infrastructure, it's just not as well developed as countries like the United States or the United Kingdom, or developed Europe and as such 4G, 5G, even Wi-Fi, sometimes even 3G are only available in the largest cities, and certainly not in most of Nigeria's rural areas.In fact, where many of our farmers are located, they don't have access to data coverage. And as such a web-based app that we would typically expect to see on our handsets in the U.S. or the UK or Europe for example, it just simply won't work in those areas. As such the USSD platform, which is similar to the old WAP services that some of you may well remember, was used commonly on mobile phones when the displays were in micro, which is primarily text-based, but this is the only type of platform that's accessible to many of Nigeria's farmers. It is not just Tingo that offers USSD platform in Nigeria. In fact, nearly every bank, insurance company, telco, and public service provider, they all operate a USSD platform because of those very issues. All of that being said, I mean, Nigeria is developing at pace. A network and data coverage will continue to get better over time, which is the reason why we are now developing and then was a web-based app, which once launched will be operated in parallel with our USSD version. Look, I think it's when we launch the full version of the TingoPays app, which is web-based, that you'll see a platform that resembles what you are used to seeing in the United States and Europe. But remember the difference here, is that's aimed at the middle classes in Nigeria, cities and towns, such as Lagos and Abuja. And it isn't aimed at the farming communities, in the rural parts of the country. Thank you, team. Our next question asks if it is clear that the new food processing plant being built for Tingo Foods will have a material contribution to group revenues and profitability. However, given the plant is not scheduled to come online for around another 12 months, can you comment on the plans for Tingo Foods in the meantime? Yes, look, it is true that we expect, that whether we have considerable expectations around the new food processing plant. We, It's going to give us a state-of-the-art facility that can process a whole wide range of food types and produce a multitude of food and beverage products. And it's something we've said publicly. We expect it to contribute, a multi-billion dollars of revenue on an annual basis each year. But, notwithstanding the fact we're waiting for this plant to come online, I'm delighted to tell you that Tingo Foods continues to expand, In fact, during the second quarter we added two major product groups to our range, one was based on around wheat, and the other was based around the maze. And at the time, and whilst I'm speaking today, it's fair to say that those quantities are fairly small. But what this has enabled us to do is to plan around forthcoming harvest, to enable us to build our supply chain and then thereby get far greater quantities of crops from the farmers to process into food producers. And so that we, where we know there is considerable demand for, but that progress wasn't just on the supply side. During the quarter we also onboarded a major new wholesale customer, when, given how late it was in the quarter that we won the customer and the time I gave them, to book their orders, the amounts we delivered, again, were relatively small, but given the size of this particular customer in the market in which it operates, we're very confident that this customer will become a very large account for Tingo Foods by the end of this year.But what's really pleasing, I think, about these developments, in particular, is that we managed to achieve them in spite of a period of what I called earlier in the presentation of economic stagnation, where the people of Nigeria had reduced their discretionary spend and wholesalers to restaurants and hotels and other customers had reduced their inventory levels whilst we were monitoring what was going on within the political situation in Nigeria. You've heard me reference before about the presidential election that took place in February of this year. Following this, there was some speculation that the election results were going to be challenged by opposition leaders. And that is what created this period of instability and stagnation.But with the new president was inaugurated at the end of May. And with him now in place, we're witnessing a recovery in consumer confidence and business confidence. Which to be fair has been underpinned and held by the new government's focus on creating jobs and modernizing, and stabilizing the economy. And the benefit of course of that we mentioned earlier was this liberalizing supporting of its currency.But all of these points really indicate that the economic recovery in Nigeria is upon us, which of course bodes well for the rest of our business. And we're also making progress with further developments in the current quarter, including in terms of continuing to expand our product range. In particular into areas where with produce that requires more heavily processed products such as sources. And we expect these developments also to generate a significant contribution in Q4 and beyond.And our final question asks if today's news about the commencement of a quarterly dividend is very welcome. Indeed, I am sure it will go a long way to redress the clearly undervalued share price. However, does the board not consider that those funds will be better spent on a share buyback?Yes. Whilst you understand the sentiment, I think behind the question. I think it's really important to put into perspective. The considerations we have as a board and ensuring that we do our best to deliver and then protect shareholder value. Because I mentioned earlier, the company spent almost a billion dollars on investments into CapEx and inventory during the quarter. Of course, not to mention the $170 million that we paid the tax then. And that investment was made, but the primary purpose of growing the three key divisions of the group, Tingo Mobile that we spent 460 million in new handsets on, but we've said we expect to start receiving significant revenues from at the end of Q3.Tingo DMCC, where we completed our first export transactions of almost $350 million during the quarter. And Tingo Foods where we've secured huge quantities, produce that we're going to see the benefits from, again, in Q3. You've heard me say earlier that we expect to start paying much higher dividends from Q3 onwards, without the billion dollars of expenditure we had and we're just spending in Q2. The dividend almost certainly would've been somewhat higher this quarter.Look, our priority, our first priority as a board is maximizing shareholder return. And all shareholders we believe will reap the benefits of the billion dollars we've just spent. We're just invested. And as a result of that we expect our cash balances to be significantly higher at the end of Q3 than they were at Q2. And that's what gives this board the confidence that we will be in a position to increase our dividends from Q3 onwards.Now, look, all of that said, it's not lost on management or the board that our share price at these levels, it's significantly below where we think it should be. Pairing in mind that we've generated around $1.8 billion of revenue and $600 million of EBITDA during the first half of this year. So, this dividend payment today, as I've said on several occasions, is the start of an ongoing regular course of the dividend program. We believe it is the message that will help us expand and grow the number of institutional shareholders on our shareholder list. Regular quarterly dividends that have a high dividend cover and offer very attractive yields, we believe are the ingredients that help us attract a new investor audience, you know, including those institutional income funds and pension funds alike. And as such, we hope that gets reflected into the share price. However, should our share price continue to languish below a fair value, as we approach the end of Q3, the board, if it so chooses, may well consider a meaningful share buyback. Alongside a significant increase in dividend payments because what is clear is that we will, we believe or have sufficient cash reserve to accommodate both. Thank you, team. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mercer for his closing remarks.Thank you, Operator. I would like to thank each of you for joining our earnings conference call today, and I look forward to continuing to update you on our ongoing progress and growth. If we were unable to answer any of your questions, please reach out to our IR firm, MZ Group, who will be more than happy to assist. Thank you and goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",19,2023-08-31T12:46:10.000-04:00
Unit Corporation: Small Company With Tons Of Cash And Big Dividends,"I am recommending Unit Corporation () as a buy primarily due to its impressive 227% increase in operations income, 150% increase in cash from operations, and the elimination of all of its debt between DecemberThe vast majority of my figures come directly from UNTC's 2022  and UNTC's 2023 Q2 . If the reader wishes to look into these documents further, I have provided links for you to reference.Founded in 1963, Unit Corp. began as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company and has since grown into a corporation that is now involved with oil and natural gas exploration and production as well as holding a 50% stake in a midstream pipeline company. UNTC's operations are broken down into three basic business segments which consist of:These 3 segments, as of December 31st, 2022, employed 653 people. 512 of them working in the contract and drilling business, 102 in the oil and natural gas business, and 39 people employed under UNTC's general corporate group.UNTC's subsidiary Unit Drilling Company had an exciting amount of growth between 2021 and 2022 with a 94% increase in revenue from $76.1 million to $147.7 million. A convergence of an increase in day rate contracts year over year (39% on their BOSS rigs and 23% on their SCR rigs) and a 50% increase in average number of drilling rigs in use being the primary cause.The oil and natural gas segment ran under the subsidiary Unit Petroleum saw a 20% increase in year over year revenue from $272.2 million to $326.2 million. These Unit Petroleum revenue increases came from higher commodity prices. Oil prices increased 15% to $57.48 per barrel in 2022 and the average Henry Hub real natural gas price rose 53% and ranged from $9.85 MMBtu to $3.46 MMBtu from June of 2021 to June of 2022.On March 1st 2022 Superior Pipeline L.L.C. was deconsolidated from UNTC's revenue figures and therefore the revenue figures captured on UNTC's 2022 10-K only reflect the first two months of the year leading to a 76% decrease in revenue from $341.7 million to $83.2 million and a 74% decrease in operating costs year over year from $286 million to $73.8 million.Overall these substantial gains led to a 125% year over year operating income increase from $76.3 million to $172 million and a 196% increase in earnings from continuing operations from $48.2 million to $142.5 million from 2021 to 2022.UNTC's drilling revenues continued to see an exciting amount of growth in 2023. A 49% ($30.8 million) increase in revenue brings Unit Drilling Company to $93.3 million in revenue for the first 6 months of 2023 from $62.5 million in revenue earned during the first six months of 2022. Average day rate increases of 50% on Unit Drilling's BOSS rigs and a 34% average day rate increase on their SCR rigs are the primary drivers of UNTC's drilling business revenue growth while its contract drilling operating costs only increased a mere 3% during the same time period.UNTC subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company saw a large 58% decrease in revenues during the first six months of 2023 due to a trifecta of sinking natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil prices from all-time highs in the first half of 2022, mixed with UNTC's large sell off of drilling properties in 2021 and 2022 which by default also led to lower production numbers. UNTC has expressed a lot of interest in selling off large parts of its volatile gas and oil business and in 2021 sold off $23.4 million worth of gas and oil wells before doubling that number to $49 million worth in 2022. 2022's well sell off accounted for 21% of Unit Petroleum's total oil and natural gas properties. That 21% of its properties Unit Petroleum sold off corresponds rather perfectly to the 21% reduction in natural gas production, 23% decrease in oil production, and 31% decrease in natural gas liquids production Unit Petroleum also experienced. The remaining productive properties suffered from declining commodity prices. The average price for a barrel of oil fell 27%, the price of natural gas liquids fell 47%, and natural gas prices tumbled 60% all while the cost of operations only decreased by 37% to $32.4 million from $51.6 million in the first six months of 2022.All of these changes and sell offs to UNTC's businesses led to $78.2 million in income from operations during the first six months of 2023 compared to $130.8 million in income from operations in the first six months of 2022. The major reason UNTC's income from operations contracted so sharply in the first six months of 2023 is because Superior Pipeline was still being listed under operations income until March of 2022 which provided UNTC with an additional $82.7 million in revenue during Q1 of 2022 as well as the company selling off interest in 727 wells in 2022 from its oil and natural gas business.As mentioned above UNTC has been committed to selling off non-core or non-productive assets within its various businesses and sold off $12.7 million worth of non-core contract drilling assets in 2021 and $12.8 million drilling assets in 2022 leading to a net gain of $10.1 million in 2021 and $8.4 million in 2022. In 2021 UNTC saw its oil and natural gas business Unit Petroleum sell off various gas and oil wells and related leases in several states with cash proceeds net of customary closing and post-closing adjustments amounting to $23.4 million. In 2022 UNTC doubled the amount of gas and oil wells and related leases sold to $49 million worth. Other non-core oil and natural gas assets sold off for $5 million in 2021 and $7.7 million in 2022. UNTC also saw interest income of $2.6 million in 2022 compared to $0 in 2021 because of its larger cash holdings from its larger income and asset sales. Net income increased 145% from $60.6 million to $148.4 million from 2021 to 2022.In April of 2023, UNTC sold its 50% stake in Superior Pipeline for $20 million. Unit received $12 million at the closing of the sale and is entitled to the other $8 million 12 months after the date of sale. In May of 2023 UNTC closed on the sale of two of its SCR drilling rigs for $5.8 million as the company reduces its fleet to taper down to what it projects will be the future demand for oil and gas. UNTC also sold off $9.5 million in other non-core assets in its drilling business in the first six months of 2023 and another $1 million in non-core assets from its oil and natural gas business.The company did spend a lot of time narrowing down its business focus over the last three years. By selling off $73.4 million worth of its wells from its oil and gas business, $40.8 million worth of its drilling business assets in the past two and a half years, and selling all of its stake in Superior Pipeline in 2023 UNTC is setting itself up for a more streamlined business model focused primarily on the less volatile contract drilling segment of its operations.UNTC's net cash from operating activities in 2022 was $159.4 million compared to $176 million in net cash in 2021. This $16.6 million decrease (9.4%) can be attributed to the absence of operating cash flows from Superior Pipeline after March 1st 2022 and from higher payments on derivative settlements. 2021 was the first year showing a positive net income for UNTC since 2017 with a $60.6 million of net income in 2021 jumping all the way to $148.4 million in 2022 while at the same time UNTC's debt shrank from $65.3 million in 2021 to just $4.8 million in 2022. A reduction in all of its debt should give UNTC a lot of freedom in future financial decisions as they won't be as sensitive to how future interest rate hikes will affect their interest and principle payments on their current debt load.The first six months of 2023 saw Unit Corp. earn $162.7 million in net income vs. $27.4 million in the first six months of 2022 and UNTC ended its second quarter with $199.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents with a positive working capital balance of $207.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents jumped 72.8% from 2022's $115.6 million and will be used to pay out two $2.50 dividends later this year, one during the third quarter and one during fourth quarter of 2023.The $2.50 dividend paid out on June 26th, 2023 cost UNTC $24.1 million so two more $2.50 payments will likely use up somewhere between $48 - $50 million from UNTC's pile of cash. Even after another hefty 2 dividend payments UNTC should still be sitting on close to $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and management should use this liquidity to offer up more dividend payments and stock buybacks. Even after Q3 and Q4's dividend payments UNTC will still be holding onto a record amount of cash that is unprecedented when looking at the company's history. It is also holding onto this much cash while getting rid of large sections of its business and it is on this basis that my argument for an increase in either buybacks or dividends rests, primarily because a sell off of their business assets should correlate to less capital expenditure used in their remaining businesses.In 2022, the average number of drilling rigs Unit Drilling utilized went from 10.9 to 16.4 raising its oil rig utilization rate from 36% in 2021 to 78% in 2022. On top of more drilling rigs coming into operation UNTC's average revenue per day increased from $19,097 to $24,619.UNTC's subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company had a $47 million decrease in proved oil and natural gas properties from 2021 to 2022 from $225 million to $177 million. This decrease on property value comes from UNTC's announcement that it had expanded its 2021 divestiture program to include potentially the sale of all of its oil and natural gas properties and reserves. While UNTC did end the relationship with the financial advisor it had hired to advise them through these sales in June of 2022 they did see the sell off of all of their Texas Gulf Coast oil and gas properties and related leases for $45.4 million as well as the sale of wells and related leases near the Oklahoma pan handle worth $3.6 million. Thus far in 2023 Unit Petroleum has only made $1 million in proceeds from the sale of its non-core oil and natural gas assets.Unit Corp owned a 50% stake in Superior Pipeline L.L.C. and acted as an operator to the company under its subsidiary company SPC Midstream Operating, L.L.C. where UNTC received $300,000 a month to provide Superior Pipeline with operations and maintenance support, accounting, legal, and human resource services. Superior's value as of March 1st, 2022 is listed under the equity section of UNTC's balance sheet which would explain their $175.2 million increase in common equity from $187.4 million to $362.6 million from 2021 to 2022. In April of 2023, UNTC sold its 50% stake in Superior Pipeline for $20 million.Aided largely by their drilling business segment's massive increase in revenue from having more rigs active in the field and from the sales of their oil and natural gas properties and related leases UNTC saw a 234% increase in cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheet from $64.1 million in 2021 to $214 million 2022.As of June 30th, 2023 UNTC has had a 6.6% decrease in cash and cash equivalents to $199.8 million, however UNTC also has $7.9 million in notes receivable at the end of June 2023 compared to no notes receivable at the end of 2022. Bringing this into account UNTC should soon have $207.7 million in cash on hand bringing the total realistic cash decrease down just 2.9% from the end of 2022. This change in cash isn't significantly surprising when taking into account how much in dividends UNTC has paid out so far in 2023 and in fact, UNTC still has a significant amount of liquidity for future dividend payments and or stock buybacks.Currently, UNTC has no debt and in the first six months of 2023 paid only $335,000 in income taxes. Operating costs for all business segments either decreased or remained practically unchanged when comparing the first six months of 2022 to the first six months of 2023. Superior Pipeline's operating costs are completely non-existent as UNTC has completely parted ways with the company selling off its 50% stake this past April. Unit Petroleum's oil and natural gas business, due to its large well sell offs in 2022, has reduced its operating costs by 37% from $51.6 million in 2022 to $32.4 million in 2023. The only segment to increase its operating costs in the first six months of 2023 is Unit Drilling which saw a slight 3% rise of $1.8 million from $52 million to $53.8 million.When recommending stocks the biggest influence I take into account is a companies' ability to weather adverse events concerning its general business climate. UNTC's impressive ability to repay its debt and therefore reduce its interest payments on any debt it may have to refinance in the future gives an enormous advantage to UNTC in these next few years of interest rate uncertainty. Its ability to clean up its balance sheet over the past few years is a key factor as to why I am recommending this stock as a buy but, UNTC is still subject to some industry wide uncertainty that could hamper investors' ability to realize gains from this undervalued stock. Like all oil producers, OPEC+'s ability to set and support production levels for oil greatly impacts global oil demand and pricing. Global oil and gas demand could also plummet if China's economic recovery continues to stagnate and plunges the rest of the world into a recession in which case UNTC could see a reduced demand for its drilling contracts and lower prices for its oil and natural gas business segments. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also throw curve balls at future global oil and natural gas prices that markets have not factored in yet.Adverse climate effects in the United States can greatly influence demand for oil and natural gas as well. Uncharacteristic weather patterns could increase demand but may also reduce UNTC's ability to deliver its products and services to its customers. Large hurricane events can shut down off shore oil rigs and spike oil prices.  can cause a surge in oil and natural gas demand uncharacteristic of normal seasonal forecasts and as we saw in 2022  for natural gas. While derivates contracts limit future losses in the event that oil and natural gas prices fall derivates contracts also limit UNTC's ability to realize dramatic spikes in oil and gas prices as well and acts as a sort of insurance policy against extreme pricing volatility.In January of 2023 UNTC announced and paid out a special cash dividend of $10.00 a share returning a total of $96.1 million to shareholders. On June 26th, they returned another $24.1 million to shareholders through a $2.50 dividend payment and as of August 10th, 2023 UNTC has approved two more $2.50 dividend payments, one in the third and the other in the fourth quarter of 2023, the exact payment dates have yet to be announced. This leaves UNTC with a current annual dividend yield of 19.96%. Should UNTC not follow through on future dividend payments or stock buybacks after posting 2024's 10-K I would strongly consider selling this stock especially if its stock price performance remains flat.In June of 2021 UNTC began announcing it was buying back $25 million in outstanding common stock. Over the course of the next year Unit made two more announcements, one in October of 2021 increasing the buyback figure to $50 million, and one in June of 2022 further increasing UNTC's funds for stock buybacks all the way up to $100 million. This was accompanied by an impressive  in natural gas prices in 2021 and a  in natural gas prices in 2022 which helped propel UNTC's stock from under $10 in early 2021 a share to $64 in August of 2022.UNTC's stock is currently experiencing a slump when compared to its 2022 performance. The stock had hit an all-time high at $65.75 in January 2023 shortly after the company announced its $10 special dividend payment and then slumped downwards hobbling around $40.00 until May of 2023 before beginning to shoot up again after the announcement of a $2.50 dividend payment in June 2023. You can see UNTC's stock price jumping sharply though briefly the week of August 10th after UNTC announced that it had approved two more $2.50 dividend payments, one in Q3 of 2023 and another in Q4 of 2023.The price of natural gas tanked dramatically in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. Henry Hub natural gas prices were just over $9 per MMBtu in the middle of 2022 to $2.18 per MMBtu in June of 2023. Prices are expected to peak in 2023 at $3.44 per MMBtu in December and it does look like we have bottomed on natural gas prices as our supply chains readjust production and as the winter months of 2022 and 2023 had been abnormally warm reducing the need for natural gas consumption to heat homes. At the same time that natural gas prices appear to be stabilizing the price of a barrel of crude oil is rising.This convergence of more stable natural gas prices, higher oil prices, and UNTC getting rid of a substantial portion of its oil and natural gas wells in 2022 before natural gas had bottomed so it can focus on the more stable segments of its business (drilling) should help UNTC's stock begin to trend upward again. This seems all the more likely knowing that UNTC still has a large pile of cash in its war chest for further buybacks and dividend payments and may be further interested in selling off more of its natural gas assets now that the sale of Superior Pipeline has gone through.When compared to peers YPF Sociedad Anónima (), OMV AG (), Repsol S.A. ADR (), Ecopetrol S.A. (), and Imperial Oil Limited () on seeking alpha you can see UNTC's impressive earnings margins. A 47.9% return on assets compared to their peers' 5.9% to 16.7% range. A return on total capital of 35.4% as compared with peers' 4.1% to 16.5% range. An EBIT margin of 48.28% is also well above other comparable oil and gas peers with most others coming in between 6.9% and 34.1%. Gross profit margins and net income are therefore predictably higher as well with gross profit margins of 54% vs 18.6% to 41.2% and a net income margin way above their peers of 70.3% versus a 3.9% to 15.4% range.The extreme case of net income outpacing the rest of UNTC's peers by so much can be attributed to their massive sell off of property as well as entire businesses, but even so it is clear that UNTC has, by selling off unproductive or non-core assets and by paying off all of their debt, aligned themselves with a highly profitable low leveraged business model that has an open path to a more sustainably profitable future. These earnings margins offer in some sense a margin of safety to UNTC for in the event of an economic downturn. They have less of a chance of going belly up like many oil and gas companies did as a result of the 2014 - 2016 slump in oil prices. The ability to weather adverse events as just described while their peers go out of business would lead to UNTC absorbing a higher percentage of business in the oil and gas industry, clearing the way for future growth.If adverse business conditions become too great a risk for the company UNTC can just sell off the remainder of its businesses for a handsome profit. With a market cap of $473.5 million and current cash holdings of $199.8 million at the end of June 2023 UNTC should be able to sell the rest of its business segments for more than they're worth on paper. Patterson-UTI Energy () bought 17 oil rigs from Pioneer Energy Services Corp. () in 2021, 16 of which were super spec rigs similar to UNTC's BOSS rigs. At the time day rates for the utilization of these oil rigs ran around $17,000 and  Day rates currently sit at $31,990 a day for UNTC's 14 Boss rigs and $22,981 a day for their SCR rigs. After subtracting UNTC's $199.8 million worth of cash from their market cap you have $273 million in market cap value left to account for. This is right in line with the value that would, based off of the Pioneer Energy Services Corp. transaction, be paid out if UNTC sold off the rest of their drilling fleet. This leaves UNTC's entire oil and gas business Unit Petroleum as pure profit for shareholders should UNTC liquidate itself and return its full value to shareholders.I believe for the reasons previously stated that UNTC is a buy. Its earnings from operations and cash from operations have both shown an impressive increase this year while UNTC simultaneously continues to slim down its business model to focus on Unit Drilling, its most stable business segment with the most predictable growth. It's cash holding are currently near record highs even with an impressive amount of dividend payments in 2023 and some stock buybacks in 2022 which should translate to future dividend payments and buybacks as UNTC further slims down its business. Oil prices and demand are currently surging and UNTC has good price leverage on their BOSS oil rigs which continue to consistently increase their day rates with ease. Leaving the Superior Pipeline business and shrinking their exposure to the oil and natural gas business while focusing on drilling lessens their risk to the more volatile parts of the fossil fuel industry and enables them to focus on sustainable long term growth.While the Dividend payments and stock buybacks have been nice I do think that there is more to come from UNTC's massive $199.8 million pile of cash. Buybacks could ensure the stock retains its relative value while the company narrows its business interests and even with two more $2.50 dividends due before 2024, I believe UNTC will likely present another large special lump sum dividend payment early next year.Should UNTC not follow through on future dividend payments or stock buybacks after posting 2024's 10-K I would strongly consider selling this stock especially if its stock price performance remains flat. If you don't necessarily like dealing with the volatility that comes with the fossil fuel industry a good time to consider selling UNTC's stock in the future is after a stock price spike that may occur after UNTC announces other large dividend payments. While its stock should increase in price generally as natural gas prices improve and as oil prices continue to rise an excellent exit point may be created sometime early in 2024 as UNTC looks over their annual figures and historically makes large and exciting announcements to its shareholders. UNTC has enough available cash on hand to issue another $10.00 dividend payment and the stock shot up past $65.00 after UNTC announced the previous $10.00 dividend payment. If UNTC's current stock price of $49.90 shot up to $65.00 shareholders buying in at today's price would realize a 30.3% gain on top of a current annual dividend yield of 19.96%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Gentex Corporation: Technology Driven Innovation Widening Its Moat,"Our current investment thesis is:Gentex is a technology company that designs and manufactures automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and electronics forGentex’s share price performance has been respectable, generating comparable returns to the wider market. This is a reflection of its gradual financial improvement for much of this period, although its fortunes have declined since 2021.Presented above are Gentex's financial results.Gentex’s revenue has grown moderately well during the last decade, with a CAGR of 6% and broadly consistent year-on-year gains. EBITDA has trailed these gains, with a noticeable decline in margins post-FY18.Gentex is a technology-oriented company specializing in the design, development, and manufacturing of high-quality products for the automotive, aerospace, and commercial fire protection industries.A significant portion of Gentex's revenue comes from manufacturing automatic-dimming rearview mirrors for cars. These mirrors utilize electrochromic technology to automatically dim in response to headlights from trailing vehicles, reducing glare for the driver and improving safety. This technology is a major selling point for the company, allowing it to command a premium.Gentex's mirrors are not just reflective surfaces but integrated with features such as compasses, temperature displays, and rearview cameras. These integrated functionalities add value to its products relative to peers while also appealing to consumers and OEMs who are looking for premium options.In addition to these core items, Gentex also produces various electronics-based products, including dimmable aircraft windows for the aerospace industry and dimmable glass for architectural applications. It is also involved in manufacturing connected car features, biometric monitoring systems, and other advanced technologies.We believe the company’s product suite is highly attractive. The company has taken core automotive products, such as mirrors, and innovated them into a market-leading position, contributing to relationships with leading OEMs and the ability to command a premium price. From a downside perspective, its products will always be needed, regardless of trends and changing dynamics (such as EVs). For this reason, credit is owed to the company’s R&D team, with scope for further gains as spending has outstripped Revenue growth.Given the company’s weighing toward the Automotive segment, our industry analysis will focus on this. The automotive component industry is expected to grow well in the coming years, although will be impacted by various megatrends currently underway. The key driver, as discussed throughout this paper, is the demand from OEMs. For this reason, Gentex is highly reliant on consistently growing production levels.Gentex faces competition from, and operates alongside, other global component manufacturers, including the likes of Magna International (), Continental AG (), Autoliv (), and Valeo SE ().We believe the following factors will be key growth drivers in the coming years:Gentex operates with impressive margins, owing to the quality of its products and its position within the market. The company has faced slippage in recent years, some of which is competition-related, Although we predominantly attribute this to macro headwinds. From a competitive perspective, we believe its margins are defensible, owing to the technological capabilities underpinning its products (1,980 patents and 400 trademarks).Gentex’s recent performance has been strong, despite the current macro-environment, with top-line growth of +23.5%, +17.6%, +17.6%, and +25.9% in the last 4 quarters. In conjunction with this, margins have slightly improved, contributing to stabilization at an EBITDA-M level.We attribute this unusual trend to the disruption in the production of vehicles in recent years. When contextualized, the near-term improvement in growth appears reasonable. With supply pressures easing, we are seeing an increase in production, with demand sufficient to maintain a sequential uplift in production. As a result of this, Gentex has benefited from a misalignment from its usual cyclical nature.This does imply a rapid slowdown is ahead, as with elevated interest rates and a cost of living crisis across many nations, there is a rapidly declining willingness and ability to purchase new vehicles.Key takeaways from its most recent quarter are:Looking ahead, we suspect growth will rapidly slow in the coming quarters, as the supply chain improvements begin to be offset by current market conditions. The following is S&P’s LVP forecast, which suggests a decline of (3)% relative to Q3’22. Despite this, Management has slightly raised expectations (by c.$100m).Gentex’s balance sheet is relatively clean, although we do see scope for improvement. Its working capital profile has worsened during the decade, with inventory turnover declining. This has compounded the cash flow impact from the decline in profitability, with FCF falling below 15% for the first time in the decade. Although we see imminent improvement, this is a reflection of poor management.Gentex is conservatively financed, with the avoidance of debt usage. This has allowed the business to incrementally increase dividend payments, with a respectable CAGR of 4%. This said, distributions have declined from their peak between FY17 and FY21 and we are not wholly sold on the scope for near-term improvement.This has allowed ROE/ROIC to remain attractive despite the worsening margin performance. With the assumption that margins will improve, we suspect returns could again exceed 20%.Presented above is Wall Street's consensus view on the coming 5 years.Analysts are forecasting a continuation of Gentex’s existing trajectory, with a CAGR of 7% into FY27F. In conjunction with this, margins are expected to sequentially improve toward its FY19/FY20 level.We broadly concur with this assessment. Management has done a good job of transitioning the company’s products in response to the changes faced within the industry. Further, much of its margin deterioration can be attributable to demand and supply conditions, both of which will likely wholly subside by the end of FY24.Presented above is a comparison of Gentex's growth and profitability to the average of its industry, as defined by Seeking Alpha (25 companies).Gentex performs exceptionally well relative to its peers, although does have weaknesses. The company’s growth has materially lagged the industry, both on a 3Y and 5Y basis. We attribute this to its inability to achieve outsized growth in response to the EV trend, as many of its peers have experienced an acceleration. Where Gentex is responding defensively to the EV trend, many of its peers have acted aggressively through the exploitation of new technologies.Margins are the company’s strong suit. Its leading position within its product segments, efficient global production, and relationships with OEMs allow it to maximize its financial returns. We believe its delta to the industry can be protected, allowing for outsized returns.With the industry being mature and only benefiting from medium-term headwinds, we have a preference for margins over growth, suggesting Gentex should trade at a premium to its peer group.Gentex is currently trading at 14x LTM EBITDA and 12x NTM EBITDA. This is a premium to its historical average.A small premium to its historical average is justifiable in our view. Although the company’s margins have declined, we have seen positive product development leading to market share growth, an improvement in its technological capabilities, and a reasonable uptick in growth since its “soft” period between FY17 and FY21. This said, we struggle to justify a 15-20% premium, particularly as its NTM FCF yield has declined to below 5%.Further, the company is also trading at a premium to its peer group, with an LTM EBITDA delta of (32)% and a NTM FCF delta of (53)%. Given its substantial margin superiority, we consider a premium reasonable. This said, we again struggle to rationalize such a high premium.Overall, we are unconvinced by the potential for an attractive upside at its current share price. As the following graph illustrates, its valuation is trending up, without due warrant relative to profitability we feel.Gentex is a high-quality business. Through the development of superior products and a long track record of meeting OEM needs, the company has gained a market-leading position in several segments.There are numerous trends impacting the industry, including embracing technology and the transition to EVs. We believe Gentex is well positioned to achieve healthy growth as a result of this, with its product enhancement efforts showing signs of positive perception. This said, we do think the company will face issues in the near term, owing to the slowing production of LVs.With the company trading at a large premium to its historical average and peer group, we struggle to rationalize its current valuation, particularly due to the risk of performance declining and a lack of improvement in distributions   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,"This follow-up article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in U.S. energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering (2007-2022). In this period, the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet (""BCF"") of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas, it is important to first reference some history. Before that, we want to lay out some relevant terminology. Natural Gas, not surprisingly, is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature. It is measured in cubic feet at sea level (volume increases or decreases with pressure). It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet (MCF).Conveniently, one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1.036 million BTU (one author has a friend who considers this ""one of the proofs of the existence of God"") and this makes certain calculations easier (for example, a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad). Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs. After this removal, the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumers.First, a little bit of simplified but instructive history. Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers; these phases have been: 1) nuisance; 2) luxury; 3) necessity; and 4) national security. At first, it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually ""flared."" In fact, one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using no-flare orders. Natural gas began to be used in cities, but this was largely ""city gas"" produced from coal.It dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks, and pipelines started to make their way across the country. All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions. So far, so good.Then, the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, and the FPC (now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC) started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers. The ""experts"" at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production. There were various estimates, most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by now.This policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage, which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973. Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels, fuels for power plants, and in other applications. As oil prices rose, more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices. In addition, producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production. The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state (intrastate gas) was not price regulated, leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those markets.A complex mess emerged – loved by lawyers and lobbyists, but hated by the public. Each interstate pipeline had ""curtailment"" proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand. One point was widely agreed – natural gas could never be used ""under a boiler"" (i.e., to generate electricity). At one point in the interstate market, we came close to ""losing towns"" due to a cold January, and customers were told that it was patriotic to turn down the thermostat.Finally, starting in the Carter administration and continuing in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, wellhead natural gas production was deregulated. First, deep gas, then ""new"" gas, and finally all gas. It was confidently predicted by the ""experts"" that in 1984-85, when ""new gas"" was deregulated, there would be a monstrous ""fly up"" in gas prices. Just the opposite occurred, and gas became plentiful.As more and more natural gas began to be produced and as customers found that it was a reliable energy source, natural gas consumption and production increased. Now that natural gas could be used to generate electricity it gradually became a kind of ""default"" choice as a generating fuel. The electric industry has gone through various phases in terms of strategies for generation. In the early years, coal dominated. Then, there was a phase where it was trumpeted that nuclear power would take over and make electricity ""too cheap to meter.""For a whole series of reasons, this did not play out and after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, it became prohibitively expensive to build new plants. At one point, residual oil started to replace coal, and in some cases natural gas (remember that we thought we were running out of natural gas) – but the 1970s oil price shock ended that. In the late 70's, the government was encouraging ""coal conversion"" – which involved having utilities stop burning oil and start switching to coal.Now, in the 90's we began to see a halting but increasingly steady shift to natural gas. Coal was bad for global warming, oil was expensive, and nuclear was no longer on the table so natural gas was all that was left. Improvements in technology allowed for a reduction in the heat rate (the number of BTUs necessary to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity) from around 10,000 for conventional plants to 6-8 thousand for new combined cycle plants. Natural gas power plants were also much easier to site and less expensive to build than coal or nuclear plants. The table below gives total electric production and the natural gas share in 1977, 1990 (right after deregulation), 2007, and 2022 all stated in billions of kilowatt hours.Gas has increased its share enormously and that is the main reason that the domestic consumption of natural gas has increased. The table below provides natural gas consumption in the U.S. and net imports (the minus sign in 2022 means net exports) for those years in billions of cubic feet.We have been fortunate to have a massive increase in domestic production just at the time when natural gas was needed by the electric power industry. More recently, that increase in production has enabled us to become the world's largest LNG exporter and to help alleviate Europe's problem associated with the cessation of natural gas imports from Russia. Natural gas has now reached the point where its production has become a critical national security factor.The concern with global warming has led to a push for the deployment of energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. These energy sources – mostly solar and wind – generate electricity but are not easily if at all deployable to directly provide transportation, heating, and other end-use services. Even if a massive amount of energy could be generated by the deployment of these technologies, there would still be carbon emissions from fossil fuel use as heating, transportation, and other end-use fuels.As a result, climate activists have determined that a very high priority is the rapid electrification of the economy. This takes the form of mandates, prohibitions, and subsidies all favoring the replacement of gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles, and the replacement of natural gas use for heating, cooking, and other purposes with electricity. This electrification, it is assumed, will make it easier to reduce carbon emissions as solar and wind electricity production expands.At the same time, there has been strong pressure to shut down coal-fired power plants because of coal's very high carbon dioxide emissions. In the period between 2007 and 2022, the amount of electricity produced by coal plants has plummeted.It should be noted that there is also a general trend in developed economies for a higher and higher percentage of total energy consumption to be in the form of electricity. This trend is completely independent of efforts to combat global warming. The table below provides (solely for purposes of trend comparison) the total U.S. energy consumption in quadrillion BTUs and the total electricity production in terms of billions of kilowatt hours in 1950, 1975, 2007, and 2022.Over this 72-year time frame, total energy has increased by somewhat less than a factor of 3 while electricity consumption has increased by a factor of a bit less than 14. Even in the past 15 years, electricity consumption has increased while total energy has decreased slightly.Not surprisingly, climate activists have been somewhat more successful in their electrification strategy than they have with the actual deployment of renewable energy. The deployment of power plants and the necessary transmission facilities requires large-scale capital investment and is subject to intense and determined opposition that can stretch out the process or stop the project. While no one is going to sue me for buying an electric car, they are very likely to go to court to stop the production of the electricity necessary to power the car.All of these factors – the retirement of coal-fired power plants, the push for electrification, and the delay in the deployment of renewable sources of power – have created a massive opportunity for natural gas to expand its use as an electricity-generating fuel. The table below shows the billions of kilowatt hours produced by coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind in the years 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2022.Natural gas has become the leading electricity-generating fuel by a large margin. This past July we recorded the highest demand for natural gas at power plants in history one Wednesday and then the record was broken on the very next day. An interesting thought experiment would be to imagine what things would be like without fracking. We would almost certainly have had to import massive amounts of LNG which would have been much more expensive and one of the major issues in our society would have been the outrageous increases in electric rates.It is always dangerous to predict the future of energy consumption and production. However, it is reasonable to assume that policy provisions as well as long-term trends will increase the consumption of electricity in the near and intermediate future. It is also reasonable to assume that there will be continued pressure to shut down coal-fired power plants and that there may be some nuclear plants getting so old that shutdown becomes necessary. Of course, there will be increased output from solar and wind, but in that connection, the 2023 data so far shows no significant increase from comparable months in 2022. Wind may be moving up a siting cost curve having used up the sites where the amount of the wind resource, ease of construction, access to grids, and a low level of NIMBY opposition made costs reasonable. To a lesser extent, the same thing may be happening to central station solar.For this reason, one of our authors believes that distributed solar is the renewable technology that will grab the biggest share of the market going forward. Even with a massive expansion of solar and wind, the intermittent nature of these technologies will require a large and reliable base load capacity on the system and the phase-out of coal will remove many of the plants that supply such capacity. Natural gas is the only viable alternative in the near and intermediate term.In the long term the electrification of the entire automobile and SUV fleet would consume roughly 1 trillion kilowatt hours per year or roughly 25% of current U.S. electricity production (this is based on an assumption of a 7 to 1 kilowatt hour to gallon of gasoline ratio which may be optimistic). This massive increase in electricity consumption will add to the trends described above by requiring large-scale increases in generating capacity.Thus, viewing the U.S. energy market in isolation, it is almost impossible to imagine that there will not be an increasing demand for natural gas as a fuel for the generation of electricity. This will more than offset losses in demand due to the conversion of natural gas heating and cooking to electricity. In fact, such conversions are very likely – in the near and intermediate term – to result in increased natural gas being burned in power plants rather than in residences. The leader of the electrical supply team at the EIA (Energy Information Administration of the DOE) has said that ""Almost anywhere in the United States, any incremental increase in electricity demand is met with a fossil resource.""In the early part of this century, there was considerable activity on the Coast of the Gulf of Mexico planning and building LNG terminals getting ready for the ""inevitable"" need for the U.S. to import massive amounts of LNG because of the factors discussed above. As time passed the amount of gas produced through fracking surprised policymakers and began to produce a massive surplus. Plans were drastically revised, and in some cases LNG facilities were retooled so that they could operate as export facilities.In addition, methanol production (a technology for turning natural gas into a liquid that can be mixed with gasoline; methanol is extensively used in China) started to be planned for the area. Several major plants are now in production.The Ukraine war and measures preventing or at least dramatically reducing Russian gas sales to Europe created a powerful demand for LNG, and the U.S. was ready to jump into the breach. LNG exports have been increased and when added to the methanol production and export, now constitute a major portion of total natural gas output.The international market – in which the U.S. is now a major player – is complex. There is a considerable amount of ""stranded gas"" in countries subject to boycotts and sanctions. Iran and Russia could both be massive exporters in a completely free market. There is also natural gas in Latin America which is not being produced due to political factors. Some European countries could engage in fracking if they chose to do so. So, it is possible that in the intermediate or long term, U.S. exports will face competition from new sources.On the other hand, most developed countries (with some notable exceptions) face the same dilemmas in determining how to generate electricity that we face here in the US. Coal is available but disfavored due to carbon emissions. There is public opposition to nuclear. The intermittent nature of solar and wind requires a base load complement. As a result, there is likely to be an increasing demand for natural gas as a fuel for generating electricity in other nations.There may be political pressure against LNG exports both by those who believe that a ban would reduce domestic prices and by those who disfavor fracking. However, our allies need the additional gas. In addition, U.S. production is likely to be cleaner than the foreign production of gas or coal which would replace it – especially as strict U.S. restrictions on the leakage of methane in the process of production and transportation are implemented.While the export market may be more volatile than domestic demand, it is likely to be active and available to U.S. producers for a considerable time. It is ironic that, in a sense, we have done a full 180. From considering natural gas to be a finite resource on the brink of exhaustion and therefore viewing its use to generate electricity as a despicable waste, we now view it not only as our primary source for the generation of electricity but also as a source of revenue due to constantly increasing exports. This illustrates the tremendous difficulty of long and even intermediate-term energy projections. It is very easy for the ""universal consensus"" to be mistaken.The price of natural gas is volatile because its domestic use is weather sensitive. As a heating fuel, it benefits from a colder-than-normal winter. As an electricity-generating fuel, it generally benefits from a warmer-than-normal summer due to the importance of air conditioning demand. The best way to play this is to look for companies that earn money at least partly based on throughput or have a stable source of demand.In assessing other MLPs, investors can discover the percentage of revenue that is gas-related and can make a reasonable assumption that it is relatively stable. It is likely that the market has not fully digested the implications of the massive shift in the U.S. energy picture and there is still a considerable amount of money to be made.If you want full access to our Model Portfolio and our current Top Picks, join us at  for a .We are the largest income investor and retiree community on Seeking Alpha with +6000 members actively working together to make amazing retirements happen.

Future Fuel Corp - Waiting For Steady Quarterly Growth To Appear,"FutureFuel Corp () has niched itself towards both manufacturing and selling diversified chemicals and bio-based fuels. The  of these products is on the rise and presents a large TAM to tap into. The last As for my view on FF, I think they will remain in a sort of consolidation phase right now as market prices becomeThe last report showcased that FF is still quite reliant on favorable market prices to deliver solid results for investors. The unfavorable impact that the timing of the selling of Renewable Identification Numbers had on the results did slightly skew the report, but the trend seems to remain that demand won't return to previous highs for some quarters at least.The company is included in the specialty chemicals industry where it focuses on bio-based fuels as we have discussed, but also on bio-based specialty chemical products. The operations and distributions are in the United States and the demand was impressive up until the start of the pandemic as many companies became worried about overextending themselves with both orders and investments. In 2018 for  the revenues reached $291 million, and it didn't exceed that until 2021. This harmed FF and their revenues plummeted to $204 million for 2020. But since they have recovered very nicely, 2022 yielded nearly $400 million in revenues. However, recent misses on earnings reports are making it hard for investors to maintain interest in the company. With an over $16 million miss on the last report, the share price plummeted and the p/s now sits at around 0.43 which would be very appealing to most investors. However, uncertainty about continued growth is overshadowing the low valuation. They need to be able to execute on growing its operations, and that relies on a good pricing environment in order to generate earnings that can be deployed for those expansions.On the quarterly comparison, I think it does some injustice to FF. Instead, looking at the last six months, we see a clear trend upwards for the bottom lines as the EPS sits at $0.26 compared to the negative $0.35 the company posted last year. Historical growth is still somewhat muted for FF, as the revenues have only averaged a 0.91% YoY growth in the last 10 years. I want to see stronger momentum if FF is going to be considered a buy for investors. Otherwise, the company just looks like a value trap, unfortunately.Looking specifically at the revenues for the company, we can see that the biofuel revenues are making up the vast majority but have been declining around 30% on a yearly basis. This comes from a softer pricing environment but also slightly lower volumes. Looking at the segment profits, the biofuels have significantly dropped to a negative $15 million as well, down from a negative 3 million last year. It's still a relatively new market and I wouldn't expect massive margins right off the get-go, but some further improvements would be nice to see at least. Last year, the softer pricing environment for biofuels seemed to have together with the unfavorable sale of separated RINs. The next quarter will have to showcase a strong increase in profits for biofuels, as FF is also running its capacity at the highest possible level. That shows optimism about the market conditions, and I want to see them translate that into profitability before suggesting a buy here. From my title, I suggest waiting for more consistent growth and that is exactly what FF might be able to do if they are capable of better prices and higher operational capacities, but until that appears visible on an earnings report it remains a hold.In the Q2 FY2023 report from the company, a discernible concern emerges regarding the potential consequences of a prolonged or worsening COVID-19 environment on FF operations and its corresponding cash flows. Within this narrative, a focal point of vulnerability becomes evident, primarily revolving around the demand dynamics within the FF customer base. A particularly significant sphere of impact would be the demand for chemicals, a crucial sector for the company's revenue streams. Biofuels, for example, are in high demand when the economy is doing very well and shipments and transportation are strong, but when demand lowers so does the need for fuel and prices become less competitive, which could potentially hurt the company's revenues. The biofuels market is expected to grow at a  of 5.2% from now until 2028 which should be visible in the top line for FF in that period. The global biofuel market is  at over $200 billion, and FF is not generating enough revenues to be a major player here yet. With TTM revenues of just under $400 million, the company has a lot of room to grow still. It seems that FCF has been struggling for the last few years but is finally on the rise again. However, there needs to be some certainty about their persistence I think before we suggest that FF is anything but a hold right now. A recovery to the consistency that FF had before the pandemic I think is highly sought after by investors. In the last 5 years, they have averaged a top-line growth of , and I would like to see a higher one than that posted consistently on a YoY basis to make FF a potential buy.While FF has displayed solid resilience and experienced a decent recovery in demand since the initial onslaught of the pandemic in early 2020, it's imperative to acknowledge that this resurgence hasn't yet fully retraced the path to pre-pandemic levels. Going all the way back to 2013 for example, the revenues exceeded $400 million, and I think that is the next target to beat for FF. The intricate interplay of global uncertainties and economic ebbs and flows continues to exert its influence, resulting in a demand landscape that remains somewhat below the benchmarks set before the pandemic's onset. The lower demand for fuel that the pandemic brought and the decrease in travel severely harmed the results for FF, but we are seemingly on a recovery as fuel  remains high, but emissions from new vehicles are at a record low. Seeing as FF provides bio-based fuel, I think they will have a very large market to continue and serve for years to come, and I am not worried about the long-term picture.A highlight of FF continues to be the  which boasts a strong cash position and no debt still.The cash position for FF sits at $166 million right now and is only a slight decrease of $9 million from the end of December 2022. With nearly a majority of assets in cash, the company is in a very liquid position, which should let them be able to freely make investments into new ventures and projects. This should result in them having stronger production levels and once demand and more favorable pricing returns, hard FF is in a good position to capitalize from it. Even taking on some debt to fund it doesn't seem that bad. Without debt, the company is in a position where it would make sense to do so as well.FF has a diversified business model, but a focus still on manufacturing and selling bio-based fuels to an American market. The company had a steady uptrend until the pandemic hit, which impacted the business quite negatively as revenues dropped and FCF became negative for both 2020 and 2021.I am looking for a recovery in the top and bottom lines before entering into a position. There is still a need to prove that they can capture demand for bio-based fuels, and if they need to take on debt to fuel expansion, then so be it. I am looking at FF as a potential growth story, but they seem to be lacking some of the incentives to make it such a story. For these reasons, I am rather rating FF a hold than a buy right now.

Chevron's Current Stock Price Is Already Reflecting Its Permian Developments,"Chevron Corporation's () stock price decreased from $188 per share at the end of January 2023 to $159 per share on 24 August 2023, as the company's financial results were impaired in the past two quarters. CVX'sIn its 2Q 2023 , one of the most important things that Chevron anchored its future to, was its Permian development (seeCVX's upstream earnings accounts for 82% of its total earnings, and the share of U.S. upstream earnings in the company's total upstream earnings was only 33% in 2Q 2023. In 1H 2023, U.S. upstream earnings accounted for 34% of CVX's total upstream earnings, and in the full year 2022, U.S. upstream earnings accounted for 42% of its total upstream earnings. However, in the full year 2021, U.S. upstream earnings accounted for 46% of its total upstream earnings, and in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the share of U.S. upstream earnings in the company's total upstream earnings was more than 50%. What I'm trying to say is that in the current market condition, more Permian production levels may not be able to boost CVX's financial results as the company's international operation results are playing a more important role. It is worth noting that in the downstream segment, CVX's domestic earnings are significantly higher than its international earnings (however, CVX's downstream earnings accounts for only 25% of its total earnings).I'm not saying that CVX's developments in the Permian Basin are negligible. As oil and natural gas production in the Permian Basin jumped in the past few years (see Figure 3), Chevron had to develop its footprint in the region to remain one of the biggest liquids and natural gas producers in the United States. However, as a great part of CVX's financial earnings is linked to its operational results in other countries, you shouldn't get too excited about its developments in the Permian Basin. Furthermore, it is important to know that in the past three years, CVX's international liquids and natural gas average realizations were significantly higher than its U.S. liquids and natural gas average realizations (see Figure 4). According to EIA's short-term energy , crude oil prices in the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024 are expected to be higher than in the first half of 2023. Also, Henry Hub natural gas prices in 2H 2023 and 1H 2024 are expected to be higher than in 1H 2023. As a result, overall, due to increasing production levels, and higher price realizations, Chevron's financial results can improve in the next few quarters. However, as energy prices are not expected to reach their levels in 2022, I don't expect CVX's earnings to reach their levels in 2022. It's simple math! A year ago, CVX's stock price was trading at around $165 per share. In the third quarter of 2023, CVX had a net income per diluted share of $5.78, and in 2Q 2023, its net income per diluted share was $3.20.Even with higher production and higher realizations in the third quarter of 2023, CVX's net income per diluted share in 3Q 2023 is not expected to get close to its levels a year ago. Despite that, CVX's stock price is now trading at around $160 per share. From my perspective, CVX's current stock price is already representing the company's developments in the Permian Basin, higher energy prices in 2H 2023 and 1H 2024, and its international developments by achieving first natural gas production from Gorgon Stage 2 development in Australia, reaching final investment decision to build a third gathering pipeline that is expected to increase production capacity from 1.2 to nearly 1.4 billion cubic feet per day in the Leviathan field in Israel, signing agreements to conduct pilot test on advanced loop geothermal technology in Japan.Figure 1 - CVX's Permian company-operated well performance on planFigure 2 - CVX's Permian long-term productionFigure 3 - Oil and natural gas production in the Permian regionFigure 4 - CVX's U.S. and international average realizationsAccording to Figure 5, Chevron's gross profit margin is higher than the gross profit margin of Exxon Mobil () and lower than Occidental Petroleum (), which means that the company is in a normal position in turning every dollar it pays directly to make revenue to cash. However, CVX's profit margin is lower than its peers, meaning that its ability to turn its revenues into net income is lower than its peers. Also, Chevron has a return on equity (ROE) of 19.11%, which is lower than the ROE of Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum (see Figure 6).Figure 5 - CVX's gross profit margin and profit margin vs. peersFigure 6 - CVX's ROE vs. peersThus, Chevron's gross profit margin, profit margin, and return on equity, don't suggest that the company is in a better financial position compared to its peers. Despite that, CVX's EV to free cash flow and EV/EBITDA are higher than the EV to free cash flow and EV/EBITDA ratios of Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum (see Figure 7). Chevron's recent developments mean higher domestic and international production levels, and its recent  of PDC Energy, which has high-quality assets in important U.S. Basins, (including 275000 net acres in the Denver-Julesburg Basin adjacent to Chevron's existing operations, which add more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent proved reserves, and 25000 net acres in the Permian Basin), combined with its better leverage ratios (see Figure 8), may support its higher EV to free cash flow and higher EV/EBITDA compared to Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum; however, cannot support higher prices in the current market condition.Figure 7 - CVX's EV to free cash flow and EV/EBITDA vs. peersFigure 8 - CVX's debt to equity ratio vs. peersChevron's 2Q 2023 financial results show that lower energy prices in the past two quarters hurt the company's earnings and cash flow generation ability in a significant way. The company is increasing its domestic production by enhancing its footprint in the Permian Basin. Also, through its international developments in Australia, Japan, and Israel, tries to benefit more from the current market condition (in the past three years, CVX's international liquids and natural gas realizations have been higher than its U.S. liquids and natural gas realizations). However, the current stock price is already representing its increasing production levels, and based on the current market outlook, energy prices are not going to jump shortly. Furthermore, compared to its peers, the stock is not overvalued or undervalued. CVX is a hold.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Alliance Resource Partners L.P. (ARLP) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Alliance Resource Partners L.P. () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2023 10:00 AM ETJoe Craft - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerCary Marshall - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerNathan Martin - Benchmark CompanyMark Reichman - Noble Capital MarketsDavid Marsh - Singular ResearchDave Storms - Stonegate Capital MarketHello. And welcome to the Alliance Resource Partners Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor to Senior Vice President and CFO, Cary Marshall. Please go ahead, sir.Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Earlier this morning, Alliance Resource Partners released its third quarter 2023 financial and operating results, and we will now discuss those results as well as our perspective on current market conditions and outlook for the balance of 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to answer your questions.Before beginning, a reminder that some of our remarks today may include forward-looking statements subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions contained in our filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also reflected in this morning's press release. While these forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those we projected or expected. And in providing these remarks, the partnership has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law to do so.Finally, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations of theTotal revenues in the 2023 quarter increased slightly to $636.5 million compared to $632.5 million in the 2022 quarter. The modest year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher transportation and other revenues, partially offset by lower oil and gas royalties. Total coal sales price per ton rose to $64.94 per ton for the 2023 quarter, an increase of 8.3% versus the 2022 quarter, and continues to reflect the positive impacts of our contracted order book. On a sequential basis, coal sales price per ton was 3.2% higher.In our Royalty segment, total revenues were $53.1 million, down 9% year-over-year but up 6.2% sequentially. Our results versus the prior year period reflect lower realized oil and gas commodity pricing that more than offset record oil and gas volumes and increases in coal royalty revenue per ton. Specifically, Coal Royalty Revenue per ton was up 13.5% compared to the 2022 quarter, while lower commodity prices led to oil and gas royalties average realized sales prices being down 31.2% per barrel of oil equivalent versus the 2022 quarter. Sequentially, Coal Royalty Revenue per ton was up 3.7% and oil and gas royalties average sales prices were up 2.1% per barrel of oil equivalent.As it relates to volume, coal production decreased 7% to 8.4 million tons, while coal sales volumes decreased 7.9% to 8.5 million tons compared to the 2022 quarter. Compared to the sequential quarter, coal sales volumes decreased 5% due to lower sales volumes in our Appalachia segment. Coal sales volumes in Appalachia were down 15.2% compared to the sequential quarters due to lock outages, customer plant maintenance, a reduction in operating shifts at our MC mining operation, and challenging geologic conditions at our Mettiki longwall operation that has delayed development of a new longwall district. Coal royalty tons sold declined 11.8% year-over-year, while oil and gas royalty volumes increased 28.2% on a barrel of oil equivalent basis year-over-year. The increased volumes from oil and gas resulted from the acquisition of additional oil and gas mineral interests and increased drilling and completion activities on our acreage.Turning to cost, segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton sold for our coal operations was $41.19 per ton. An increase of 13.8% and 8 .8% respectively versus the 2022 in sequential quarters. Higher labor, maintenance, purchase coal and sales related expenses per ton, particularly in Appalachia, all contributed to the higher cost. The Appalachia segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton increased by $11.06 per ton and $12.80 per ton respectively compared to the 2022 in sequential quarters. Of the total increases, approximately $3.97 per ton and $5.91 per ton respectively were attributable to Mettiki which had the longwall idle during the full 2023 quarter. The longwall at Mettiki is expected to be back in production in the new longwall district in late November. Brokerage bought and sold at a profit in our Appalachia segment some high cost coal during the 2023 quarter which accounted for approximately $3.07 and $1.59 per ton of the increased expense compared to the 2022 in sequential quarters. The balance of the Appalachia cost increase during the 2023 quarter was due to a 20% drop in production at our MC Mining operation and adverse mining conditions and equipment availability at our Tunnel Ridge Mine, which resulted in several large unit shifts during the 2023 quarter.Our net income in 2023 was $153.7 million, 8.4% lower as compared to the 2022 quarter. The decrease reflects lower coal sales volumes, higher production expenses, and lower realized prices in oil and gas royalties, partially offset by higher coal sales price per ton realization and higher volumes in oil and gas royalties. EBITDA for the quarter was $227.6 million, down 10.3% as compared to the prior year period.Now turning to our balance sheet and uses of cash, Alliance generated $123.7 million of free cash flow in the 2023 quarter. Our total and net leverage ratios were 0.36x and 0.17x respectively total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Total liquidity was $629.5 million at quarter end, which included approximately $197.2 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the 2023 quarter, we paid a quarterly distribution of $0.70 per unit equating to an annualized rate of $2.80 per unit. This distribution level is unchanged sequentially and up 40% versus the prior year quarter. Additionally, we reduced our outstanding senior notes balance by $54.6 million and completed two strategic new venture investments in the Ascend Elements and Infinitum during the 2023 quarter, totaling approximately $50 million.Now turning to updated guidance detailed in this morning's release, we have elected to slightly adjust our full year 2023 coal sales volumes and pricing, which will be highly dependent upon logistics during the fourth quarter. We now anticipate ARLP’s overall coal sales volumes in 2023 to be in the range of 34.5 to 35 million tons. Our committed tonnage for 2023 is 35 million tons. Of that total, 29.7 million is committed domestically and 5.3 million tons are committed to the export markets. We are encouraged by improving coal export market fundamentals based on recent international benchmark pricing. We believe there could be some incremental sales opportunities in late 2023 in the export markets.For 2024, we currently have 27.3 million tons committed, comprised of 25.7 million tons in the domestic markets and 1.6 million tons for the export markets. As we look to 2024, we do believe there is opportunity in 2024 for us to ship more tons into the export markets in 2024 versus 2023 levels based on current export market fundamentals. Sales pricing for the year is expected to be slightly lower than at the time of our last update. We have chosen to modestly adjust our outlook for average coal price realizations for 2023 for a new range of $64.50 to $66 per ton from $65 to $66 per ton previously communicated.On the cost side, we have narrowed our full year 2023 segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton to a new range of $39.50 to $40.50 per ton from the previous range of $38 to $41 per ton. We have fourth quarter 2023 longwall moves scheduled at our Hamilton Mine in the Illinois basin and our Tunnel Ridge operation in Appalachia. We do expect Appalachia segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8% to 10% higher than 2023 quarter cost per ton, while Illinois basin fourth quarter cost per ton are anticipated to be in line with the 2023 quarter. In our oil and gas segment, we are reiterating our guidance ranges for the full year and all of our other guidance items are unchanged.And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe for comments on the market and his outlook for ARLP. Joe?Thank you, Cary and good morning, everyone. I want to begin my comments by thanking the entire Alliance organization for their continued hard work and dedication. I am proud of all that has been accomplished through the first three quarters of the year as we are on track to achieve another record year, beating last year's full year’s revenue and net income numbers. Our well contracted coal order book enabled us to navigate an otherwise challenging operating environment during the 2023 quarter.Our Coal segment achieved higher realized pricing per ton sold relative to both the 2022 and sequential quarters. A theme that continues to favorably impact year-to-date results, particularly with regards to EBITDA and net income. However, we did face some difficult mining conditions in Appalachia at all three mines during the 2023 quarter, which resulted in higher operating cost and fewer tons produced versus previous expectations. Mild weather experienced in the first half of the year, combined with lower natural gas prices throughout the year, have impacted coal consumption in 2023, preventing us from topping last year's record coal sales volumes. As we look to next year, we have seen a recent increase in the natural gas forward curve, as well as a jump in API 2 pricing, due in large part to the conflict in the Middle East. At projected pricing levels, we believe that our export potential in 2024 will improve markedly as compared to the back half of 2023.Our Oil and Gas Royalty segment reported continued growth in the 2023 quarter, resulting in record production volumes, underscoring the success of recent acquisitions in core parts of the prolific Permian basin. All those averages realized that pricing per BOE during the 2023 quarter was lower compared to near record levels in the 2022 quarter. Our Royalty portfolio is well positioned to provide significant cash flow via hedge-free exposure to commodity pricing cost free organically growth. We expect additional growth and production will lead to record production volumes in 2024 as we continue to invest in minerals. The strong cash flow generation of our underlying businesses positions us to continue improving our balance sheet and pursue the highest and best uses for our capital.During the quarter, we paid a regular distribution, repurchased and redeemed a portion of our outstanding senior notes and announced two exciting investments made by our New Ventures Group. The first was a $25 million investment in Ascend Elements which is a U.S. based manufacturer and recycler of sustainable engineered battery materials for EVs. The investment was part of their $460 million Series D funding round which went combined with a $480 million DOE grant, will help advance the construction of North America's first commercial scale manufacturing facility, producing cathode materials for EV batteries located essentially in our backyard in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Beyond our initial contribution, we plan to evaluate additional partnership opportunities with the Ascend to expand our investment in the battery recycling industry and support the critical materials infrastructure needed to facilitate the onshoring of U.S. battery manufacturing.The second investment included in an additional $25 million in Infinitum, a Texas-based developer and manufacturer of high-efficiency electric motors, as part of their ongoing Series E equity raise. If you recall, we originally invested in Infinitum in April of 2022, and with today's announcement, our total investment in Infinitum is now $67 million, making us a meaningful investor in the company. We believe Infinitum's patented air core motor technology has significant market potential, and our technology division, Matrix, is actively exploring opportunities to collaborate with Infinitum and incorporate the technology into our current mining operations.In closing, I am proud of ARLP’s performance year-to-date and encouraged by the opportunities in front of us. We remain focused on finishing the year strong and gearing up for what should be another successful year in 2024.That concludes our prepared comments, and I'll now ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator?[Operator Instructions]Our first question is coming from Nathan Martin from Benchmark Company.Hey, thanks operator. Good morning, Joe, Cary. Appreciate you taking my questions. Just maybe a quick clarification to start. Cary, you mentioned Appalachian cost for ton could be up 8% to 10% in the fourth quarter. Just want to confirm that versus the 3Q ‘23 results, that's 54, 84. And you also said a minute ago that IB costs, Illinois Basin costs should be flat. Was that also with the third quarter ‘23?Yes, that's right, Nate.Okay, perfect. Thanks for that. And kind of moving on. I think when we talked last quarter, obviously the expectation was sales would outpace production in the second half draw down inventories, I think to around 0.5 million tons or so by the year end. Unfortunately, that didn't really work out here in the third quarter, because in the items you guys mentioned, I think it was only about 100,000 ton draw. What do you need from a logistic standpoint to kind of get you to the high or the low end of your revised for your guidance? Are there any carryover effects from some of those 3Q items you guys mentioned, like the lock outage, customer maintenance, et cetera?Yes, so when you look at the sales range, we show that our contracted position for 2023 is 35 million. That's what we are targeting to ship in for the full year. There could be logistical impacts that could drop that to the 34.5 tons are sold, whatever would not be delivered would be really primarily driven by making sure that we have the proper transportation and deliveries, vessel loadings, et cetera occurring during the fourth quarter. Whatever doesn't occur in the fourth quarter, we'll roll over into 2025. So part of our mix, when you get into sales price and you get into the volume, it does try to focus on what will be the specific contracts that are being served in the particular years. So, when you think in terms of the pricing, it's really not from one quarter to the next. I mean, the revenue is going to be basically the same. It's just a timing issue. Cary mentioned in his prepared remarks that there is potential that we could pick up some additional export tons sells in the fourth quarter. If that were to happen, those would be at a little lower price than what our contract tons that would be rolled over into 2024.So that's the issue. So from a volume perspective, if we can ship what we want to ship and what we plan to ship, we will be in inventory levels near where we talked about last quarter, I believe. If for some reason we get delayed and we go to the 34.5 and that's going to push those inventory levels up. So it's a matter of the logistics on shipping. I think from a production standpoint, our production impact for the quarter in both Mettiki and MC Mining is going to continue into the fourth quarter so we've had some people trying to retain sufficient people and our MC Mining has been a challenge for us so we had to reduce a unit of production at MC Mining Towards the back end of the last quarter that's going to continue into the fourth quarter and then at Mettiki as Cary mentioned the longwall is not expected to start until the end of November. So we'll pick up a little bit of tons with the longwall production, but still we are, our production is limiting our ability to ship some export tons coming out of those two operations.I think the only other thing I would add to that Nate is when I made reference to the lock outages and the customer maintenance issues, those are flowing now the customer that we were referring to and in our comments are back online now and the tons there are flowing as well.Very helpful guys, appreciate that. And then maybe continue the export theme for a second you mentioned improving export cold demand then you're based on our recent trends in the API 2 price as well as emerging opportunities in the markets. Can you talk about what those emerging opportunities entail and then second you mentioned ‘24 export potentially should improve markedly versus ‘23. So how many export tons do you expect this year and then how should we think about ARLP's export tonnage over the next few yearsSo right now we're targeting 5.3, which is what we've got contracted. We could pick up another couple of vessels in 2023. So that number could go up a little bit. It's also possible that number could slide a little bit depending on vessels for this particular year. As we looked at next year as we've said previously, we believe we have a strong domestic market share for right at 30 million tons. We do think, however, in 2024 that there's still continuing overhang of inventory at our utilities. And we expect that the market pricing for exports going to be better than the domestic market. So we may be a tad lower than the 29.7. Maybe it's 28, don't know for sure. And whatever that would be, it would flow into the export market as we think of our sales for 2024. Right now, I think a conservative estimate is consistent with what we're doing in 2023. But we do have, we believe we would have the potential based on what we're seeing in the export market right now to possibly expand that to 36 million. If the export market opportunities do, in fact, occur as we're projecting. So there could be that spread of maybe going as high as 7.5 million to 8 million tons in the export market next year. It's going to be depended between the domestic and export opportunities that are presented to us in 2024.Got it, Joe. Thanks. And then just maybe wrapping up with a question on the domestic side. I think you mentioned last quarter there were a number of customers out with RFPs looking to fill their books up for ‘24 and beyond. I think many for multiyear periods. You mentioned some of the issues we've had this year with high utility stockpiles and net gas prices. But it should be great to get your updated thoughts on what you guys are seeing in the market and how that demand looks for the next couple of years.Yes, we are seeing a couple of, we're participating in a couple of solicitations right now for tonnage in the 2025 to 2028 time period. Again, for 2024 there is some solicitations also, there are more volumes in the out years than it is in 2024. When we look at the tonnage, we were able to book in the third quarter, we actually booked 1.1 million tons of opportunity, but it's mostly in 2023. And then that has allowed for some rollover into 2024 as we look at that position. So again, we're very comfortable that 2025 the market reopens to where we will be at that 30 million ton level at least on domestic sales. And we would like to expect that that's going to continue through the balance of this decade that we would be at that 30 million ton level domestically and feel that the contracts will definitely be there for us as we progress looking forward for the next decade, until the end of the decade. And then the export market we'll just have to read that and see if it's going to be in that 7 to 8 million ton level, slide back, slide it up. It just depends on whatever the market's going to be at the time.Next question is coming from Mark Reichman from Noble Capital Markets.Thank you and good morning. So just continuing that discussion on 2024. So I mean for 2023 from the last quarter, it looked like you picked up 500,000 tons in the export market. And for 2024, you picked up an additional 400,000 tons kind of split evenly between domestic and export. And that's a little slower than where you were last year third quarter, compared to the second quarter. So is this just a timing or do you think, I mean, are you looking at it from a standpoint that, yes, this overhang, it's slowing things down a little bit. Good way on domestic pricing, but you'll make some of that up in the export market or do you feel like the domestically, it's just kind of a timing that you would, at the kind of -- at the very least be kind of even for with 2023 levels.We think consumption in the U.S. domestic market for coal in ‘24 will be very comparable to ‘23. And we know that was impacted by natural gas prices. We are seeing natural gas prices rise compared to where it's been in 2023, so there could be some upside to that, but there is still the increased inventory that the utilities have to, they would like to work down, and maybe that's 20-day supply at both the Illinois Basin and Northern App. So we're not anticipating the increase in sales, as I just mentioned to the domestic market. So we do believe we will be selling more tons in the export market in ‘24 than ‘23 as we look at our book of business today. So again, we're looking at 35 million tons sales this year, 35 million next year, possibly going to 36, depending on what the demand is for coal.Okay, no, that's very helpful. And then also, this quarter, I had not assumed any outside coal purchases during the quarter and you had some in the second quarter. Do you expect any in the fourth quarter?So those purchases were really caused by our longwall not producing in the third quarter. So when we look at the fourth quarter, Cary, do we, I don't think we have very much.Maybe just a modest amount. It's not very much at Illinois.Okay, great. And then just lastly, on capital allocation. Joe, you did a very articulated kind of your capital allocation strategy on the last quarter call. But the company is finding some very promising investments outside its traditional businesses. So, I mean, if you were to wanting to increase, let's say the amount of investments outside the traditional businesses, how are you thinking about claims on cash flow for 2024 being the debt repayment, the dividend or the distribution versus growth expenditures?Yes. I think when we're to respond to that question, we have been evaluating opportunities to refinance some of the senior notes as opposed to paying them off. It would free that cash flow up. So there's about four different avenues we're evaluating and we find that they're promising that it's more likely than not we'll be able to do that. So that's going to free up. So we're 285 today, Cary.That's right.Yes. So assuming that we can refinance that 285, that's going to free up some capital that allows us to follow the path that I talked about last quarter on our capital allocations.Next question is coming from David Marsh from Singular Research.Hi, guys. Thanks for taking questions. I just wanted to follow up actually on kind of where that last line of question was going with regard to the acquisitions outside of the coal space into some of the newer ventures. Could you just talk about kind of a long-term plan and thought process in terms of how large these external investments could grow? And obviously, I think it's pretty exciting that the acquisition into the electric vehicle battery or recycling space, could just talk about any other spaces that you're looking at outside of the traditional coal and oil and gas spaces that could be potentially on the horizon.Yes. So I think we mentioned in our release as well as in Cary's comments and mine as well that both of our investments, in the investment in Ascend as well as the investment that we made Infinitum, we believe not only are the investments in those companies but we believe that they'll provide strategic opportunities for us that we could invest. And it's a little premature to give you exact dollar amounts as to what that could be, but it could be sizable. So what we're looking for with those relationships are the ability to invest in businesses that we can bring online that would be sustainable for many years, and that can generate cash flow that actually can be financeable as well. So that's our goal within those two investments. We have focused within our technology group at Matrix to focus on the battery space, and that battery space can be anything from what we're talking about with Ascend, it could be with battery recycling. It can also be in battery storage, whether it be for industrial, whether it be for commercial, whether it be for utility grade, battery storage that we think is necessary. There could be, in addition to the recycling, other aspects of battery technology, we're looking at some manufacturing work that can apply to the transmission area and the build-out of the grid, utilizing our machine shops that we have within, that are being managed by the Matrix group as well.We're also looking at Matrix and their products that they're developing. We've talked in the past about them growing their cash flow with innovative products that they are bringing to market specifically, they're in Telezone, which is the product that we have now that has been providing the cash flow. That's being broadened internationally and we believe that has growth potential and we're booking orders for 2024 and that specific area of Matrix. In addition, they've got OmniPro, which we've talked about. It's also going to be rolling out in 2024, which is a collision of when it's camera type technology for the forklift industry. We think that within that technology company we have, there are a lot of exciting things that there are indeed group are looking at that we think will be adding meaningfully as we look over the next five to six years, meaningfully growing that particular segment to hopefully it will be large enough to be a segment in three to four years if we can bring these things to market like we're currently anticipating. So those are some of the ideas that we have. And obviously we're continuing to believe in our mineral segment and continuing to want to invest in that so that that can continue to grow as well as the other new venture concepts that I just outlined.That's certainly very compelling for divesting away from the core business and making it a little bit more interesting with some potential upside kickers. So that's compelling. With regard to the distribution, which you guys continue to maintain, very solid distribution, obviously where the units are trading now, dividend yield is very attractive. With the cash flow at this point in time and the outlook, support possibly an increase in that distribution as we start to head into next year or given where the units are trading is the board perhaps evaluating maybe repurchasing some of the units.I think that as we look to next year, we're still in our planning process. However, sort of given you some indication that we're looking at next year pretty much being a mirror of this year as far as where we are right now thinking that our cash flow would be. And so when we think of distributions, we have the capability to maintain or grow. I think that right now we're focused on finishing out this year strong and we are committed, as I've repeated the last two calls with our distribution at the level it is this year, we to be frank we're a little disappointed that the market hasn't appreciated those by. The unit price not reflecting to where we've got to yield. It's probably higher than it should be. In other words, our unit price should be higher than where it is. But the board will, once we finalize our plan, present that to them. We'll have a preliminary review with them in December, but the final plan will be approved in January and we'll be in a position to better answer your question as to what the future distribution policy will be at our January call.Our next question is coming from Dave Storms from Stonegate.Good morning. Appreciate you taking questions and just want to go back early in the call. You had mentioned that logistics are going to be the big driver of what your ship tons look like to close out the year. Are there any variables any notable variables and logistics channel that you're keeping a particular eye on.The primary is just our export shipments. So we do have inventory at the pier. But we're going to need to continue to ship coal from our mines to the piers and we've had some low water in the Mississippi that has slowed some of the barge movements. So it's really just a matter of timing and barge. Availability to be able to ship our tons to be able to also match when the vessels come in and what the loading dates actually turn out to be. So that's the primary logistical issue that we'd be faced. I don't think with our domestic customers there are any concerns about barge availability, water, et cetera but it's more on the export side to where we could have some timing issues on vessel loadings.Understood. Thank you. And then you also mentioned in the call just some challenges around labor and equipment in the quarter. Should we expect that that will be all wrapped up before the end of fiscal year ;24?From an equipment standpoint, yes. That was isolated at basically at both MC Mining and at Tunnel Ridge. Tunnel Ridge is already corrected itself. We've gotten the repairs; the delays are behind us. At MC Mining, we've had new deliveries for equipment to replace the older equipment that were delayed, that caused some of the impact on production. And I think all that, those items are expected to be delivered now as we speak. So we do believe by the end of the year, from an equipment standpoint, that will be behind us. As far as headcount, right now we're planning to run MC at three units. So that's still in the balance. So that still could be an issue for MC Mining. So that could be one unit of production. But at all other mines, we're expecting that we'll be fully staffed to be able to meet our production levels that we're able to do this year and continue into next year. We are actually seeing some improvement in Illinois Basin. So we've done some reevaluation of our approach to try to recruit by opening our Henderson County Mine. That's opened a new market for some workers that we're starting to see some increased applicant flow that's encouraging for our River View Mine.That's great to hear. And then lastly, we'd just love to get your thoughts on the domestic regulatory environment, anything that you're watching with the election cycle or anything of that nature.All right. From a regulatory standpoint, the big issues related to our customers. I mentioned about that in the last quarter. Not a lot's progressed in that area. There are eight different regulations that EPA has proposed. There's only one that's been finalized. And they're still out there. At the same time, what we've seen really starting from last call through today and I think it's going to continue is that we're starting to, the industry is starting to value the need for reliability and because there is a concern of reliability and what the impact of these regulations may have on reliability of electricity generation that may have slowed down the process here. I don't know for; I don't really know why we haven't seen much progress. I'm not complaining but it's still out there, it's still an issue. However, I think the demand that's needed has been a recognition that similar to what you look at where the administration is on oil, right? I mean, they want to make that sure that gasoline prices are reasonable to low so they're going to try to encourage enough supply to come on the market in an election year. I would hope that they don't want to see blackouts and brownouts on the electric side in an election year either. So maybe things will delay, be delayed until after the election, it's hard to know but they're still out there from EPA perspective at the same time. They're just artificial compliance dates. There's no reason why they have to be on the certain dates that they got in proposed and so we haven't seen the final, they've got comments so we've got to wait and see what the final rules are to really be able to answer your question.Thank you. We reached end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Cary for any further or closing comments.Thank you, Operator. And to everyone on the call. We appreciate your time this morning as well and also your continued support and interest in Alliance. Our next call to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 financial and operating results is currently expected to occur in January. And we hope everyone will join us again at that time. This concludes our call for the day. Thank you.Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",12,2023-10-27T13:37:09.000-04:00
Vale: Buy Opportunities As Support Point Nears (Technical Analysis)," () has experienced a journey marked by challenges and progression, navigating through intricate landscapes of financial strain and sustainable advancement. This journey had the company exploring uncharted territories in both economic and environmental realms, revealing its resilience andVale's  seemed somewhat strained as the pro forma adjusted EBITDA dropped to $4.1 billion, depicting a year-over-year decline of $1.4 billion. This substantial drop was primarily ascribed to the less-than-optimal achieved prices of iron ore fines and nickel.TheVale continued emphasizing value creation and shareholder value, allocating $1.4 billion in the second quarter as part of the 3rd buyback program. This commitment was compounded by the Board of Directors' approval to distribute $1.7 billion in interest on capital, based on the financial outcomes of the year's first half, demonstrating adherence to shareholder remuneration policy.On the operational front, Vale marked progress with initiatives like obtaining the operating license for the Torto dam and the commencement of its commissioning, which is set to enhance the overall ore quality significantly. This strategic move is anticipated to boost the availability of pellet feed to Vale's plants and refine the product mix, consequently acquiring higher price premiums.A series of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements inked with various authorities and partners across the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, alongside a collaboration with GravitHy, signified Vale's intent to focus and fortify its core operations. These collaborations aim to explore prospects in industrial complexes and advance studies for producing low-carbon emission products. Vale embarked on ventures aiming at energy transition, exemplified by signing a binding agreement with Manara Minerals securing strategic partnerships to facilitate value generation from unique assets and projects crucial for global energy transition. The reorganization and efficient management of Energy Transition Metals operations in Brazil and the strategic partnerships aim to accelerate value generation and are critical enablers of the global energy transition.Furthermore, Vale's commitment to sustainable mining was visible as the company achieved conformance with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) for prioritized tailings facilities and embarked on de-characterization works at various dams, signifying progress in eliminating upstream dams.This technical analysis illustrates a strongly bullish trend for Vale, as depicted in the monthly chart below. The long-term outlook for Vale is observed by the inverted head and shoulders pattern, with the head at $1.39, shoulders at $6.92 and $4.66, and the neckline approximately at $11. The pattern's low point was noted in 2016, and the price breached the pattern, meeting substantial resistance at $19.13, as indicated by the red line.The significant uptick in prices from 2016 to 2020 is primarily attributed to the resurgence in commodity values, particularly iron ore, a crucial component of the company's assortment of goods. This period aligned with a global economic revival, most prominently in China, a leading iron ore consumer. This situation resulted in a heightened demand and subsequent increase in iron ore prices. Moreover, Vale implemented widespread operational enhancements and pioneering approaches, focusing on reducing costs and boosting productivity, which ultimately led to improved financial results and strengthened confidence among investors.Furthermore, the company initiated advancements in corporate governance and sustainability, emphasizing mitigating environmental threats and addressing dam safety concerns, thereby enhancing its market image and shareholder value. The conjunction of high commodity prices, operational advancements, strategic innovations, and sustainability progressions synergistically propelled Vale's stock value during this timeframe.After reaching a substantial resistance at $19.13, the stock value reverted to the neckline of the previously breached inverted head and shoulders. This robust support of around $11 is a substantial base for prospective surges, with the price experiencing volatility above this support zone. The stock fluctuates between $11 and $19, awaiting its subsequent trajectory.To gain deeper insights into Vale's potential future trajectory, the weekly chart below illustrates the prevailing consolidation between $11 and $19, characterized by a symmetrical triangle formation. This triangular formation suggests that the price is nearing the culmination of its consolidation phase, and any breach of this pattern will signal the forthcoming trend in Vale's stock price. Additionally, the probability of a breakout on the upper side is elevated, attributed to the appearance of an inverted head and shoulders pattern, laying down a historical basis for Vale's upcoming movement.Since the stock price is consolidating at the symmetrical triangle's lower boundary, investors might consider this zone an opportune point for long-term acquisition. Furthermore, Vale's short-term daily chart underscores the manifestation of a double bottom pattern, hinting that an upward trajectory for Vale may likely be the ensuing course.Vale's financial performance is profoundly influenced by the volatile commodity prices, especially iron ore. Any adverse movements in commodity prices can severely affect the company's revenues and profitability. The worldwide economic upswing, particularly in China, can induce sharp fluctuations in demand and iron ore prices, impacting Vale's financial position. Moreover, Vale's production is subject to operational risks, including equipment failures, unplanned maintenance shutdowns, and technical failures, reducing production levels and increasing costs. Any disruptions or inefficiencies in production can adversely impact Vale's market share and financial health.Vale's commitment to sustainability and environmental concerns involves compliance with various regulations and standards. Any non-compliance with environmental laws or failure in dam safety can result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and financial losses. Additionally, the company is exposed to risks from adverse market and economic conditions, such as economic downturns or recessions, which can lead to decreased demand for its products and services, affecting its revenue and profit margins. The escalating gross debt, including leases, depicts the potential risks associated with the company's financial stability.Vale's journey in the second quarter of 2023 unfolds a complex tapestry of operational progress intertwined with steadfast dedication to sustainability and value creation. The company's financial story is marked by a noticeable reduction in pro forma adjusted EBITDA, influenced mainly by less-than-optimal pricing of iron ore fines and nickel. Despite the economic hardships, Vale showcased significant resilience and unwavering commitment to shareholder value, allocating a substantial amount for the buyback program and securing approval to distribute a noteworthy interest in the capital.Operationally, Vale achieved significant milestones, including securing the license for the Torto dam, establishing strategic collaborations globally, and focusing on low-carbon emission products, displaying commitment to refining its product mix and aligning with sustainability goals. These endeavors highlight Vale's robust strategic approach towards enhancing overall ore quality and fortifying core operations amidst a competitive global landscape. Moreover, the company's progress in sustainable mining practices, conformance with the GISTM, and commitment to dam safety underscore its dedication to environmental stewardship and sustainable advancement in the mining sector.The technical analysis reveals a bullish trend for Vale, with the stock fluctuating between $11 and $19, displaying potential for long-term acquisition opportunities for investors. However, this potential is interwoven with risks, particularly from volatile commodity prices, operational disruptions, and adherence to environmental regulations, which can significantly impact Vale's financial stability and market positioning. Investors may consider buying Vale at its present value, as the price is endeavoring to establish robust support within the symmetrical triangle.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

SandRidge Energy: Projected To End 2023 With Near $7 Per Share In Cash,"SandRidge Energy () reported decent Q2 2023 results and is largely performing in-line . It is projected to generate $44 million in free cash flow during the second half of 2023 at current strip prices, giving itAt around $16 per share I believe SandRidge is fairly valued for a long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 Henry Hub gas scenario. I estimate that it is valued at approximately 0.8x PD PV-10 at those commodity prices, after factoring in SandRidge's cash on hand.SandRidge  in July 2023 in which it paid $11.25 million to increase its working interest in 26 producing NW Stack wells. SandRidge noted that acquired net production was approximately 500 BOEPD (around 30% oil) in Q1 2023.At that production level I would expect the acquired production to contribute around $4.5 million to $5 million per year in annualized EBITDA (at mid-to-high $70s oil). However, since those are producing wells, their production and oil cut will decline over time.SandRidge's Q2 2023 , with its average daily production increasing by 5% from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. Its average daily oil production increased by 9% over the same period. SandRidge finished its 2023 development program in Q2 2023, having drilled and completed two NW Stack wells in each of the first two quarters.With its development program completed, SandRidge's production (not including the impact of its recent acquisition) is expected to decline during the remainder of the year. It appears to be on track to meet its full-year guidance without the acquired production though.SandRidge's realized prices decreased significantly in Q2 2023. While benchmark oil and gas prices declined compared to Q1 2023, SandRidge's realized prices (as a percentage of those benchmarks) also went down.For example, SandRidge realized 22% of WTI for its NGLs in Q2 2023, down from 32% of WTI in Q1 2023. As a result, its realized price for NGLs went down from $24.62 per barrel in Q1 2023 to $15.97 per barrel in Q2 2023.Source: SandRidge's Q1 and Q2 Earnings ReportsSandRidge's realized price for natural gas went down from $2.73 per Mcf in Q1 2023 to $1.31 per Mcf in Q2 2023, although SandRidge's realized price for natural gas as a percentage of Henry Hub is still tracking above its original guidance for the year to date.SandRidge's lease operating expenses went down during the quarter to $8.8 million ($5.53 per BOE) compared to $11.7 million ($7.79 per BOE) in Q1 2023. This was attributed to reduced utility costs and lower workover expenses.I have attempted to model SandRidge's results for the second half of 2023 based on current strip prices (including high-$70s WTI oil). This includes the impact of its recent acquisition.SandRidge is now projected to generate $80 million in revenues in 2H 2023, including $5 million in interest income. SandRidge does not have any hedges and its realized prices for natural gas and NGLs should be improved from Q2 2023 levels in the second half of 2023, although still likely to be lower than what it realized in Q1 2023.SandRidge has completed its 2023 drilling and completion plans, but may spend more on workovers in the second half of the year to help mitigate production declines.This results in a projection that SandRidge can generate $44 million in free cash flow in 2H 2023. SandRidge's $0.10 per share quarterly dividend will result in approximately $7 million in 2H 2023 dividend payments, and it has not reported any share repurchases under its $75 million share repurchase program.SandRidge had $224 million in cash on hand at the end of Q2 2023 and may end up with $249 million in cash on hand at the end of the year, after factoring in dividend payments and the cost of its acquisition. This also assumes there are no changes in working capital. This is approximately $6.75 per share in projected year-end cash.At around $16 per share, I believe that SandRidge is fairly valued based on my long-term commodity prices of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 Henry Hub gas. I estimate that its current price is approximately a 0.8x multiple to SandRidge's PD PV-10 at those commodity prices, and factoring in SandRidge's cash on hand. I have typically used a 0.7x to 0.9x multiple to value SandRidge.SandRidge's Q2 2023 earnings report was decent. It increased its average daily oil production by 9% compared to Q1 2023, but has now completed its 2023 development program. SandRidge's lease operating expenses went down considerably compared to Q1 2023, but its realized prices (as a percentage of benchmark prices) also declined considerably.SandRidge is now projected to generate $44 million in free cash flow in 2H 2023 at current strip prices, allowing it to end 2023 with approximately $249 million in cash on hand. This would be only $7 million less than its year-end 2022 cash balance, despite being projected to spend $93 million on dividend payments and acquisitions during the year.I believe that SandRidge remains fairly valued (at around $16 per share) for a long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 Henry Hub gas scenario.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

PetroTal reports Q3 production of 10.9k bopd,,4,2023-10-16T10:16:55.000-04:00
Kimbell Royalty Partners Looks Attractive At Current Levels,"With its recent acquisition of mineral right assets in the Permian, I believe Kimbell Royalty Partners () looks well positioned to increase its dividend in 2024, assuming energy prices hold up.KRP is a mineral interest holder thatKRP owns mineral interests across most major oil and natural gas basins in the U.S. By production, the Permian is KRP’s most prolific basin, representing nearly a third of its Q2 production, followed by the Haynesville at 21%, the Mid-Continent at 11%, the Eagle Ford andAs with any company involved in the production of oil and natural gas, the price of the underlying commodities will play a big role in its results. The reason for this is twofold. On the one hand, prices directly impact the revenue that KRP receives, so the higher prices are, the better the results the company generates. The company does use hedges, but only 15% of its production was hedged at the end of June, so it uses pretty minimal hedging.At the same time, oil and natural gas prices can impact the drilling activity of the E&Ps on its land. As a mineral owner, KRP does not have a say in the drilling activity of the operators who lease its lands, so this is always a risk.One area of particular risk on this front would be the Haynesville, where overall rig activity in the basin has fallen substantially as natural gas prices have weakened. Unlike in Appalachia, the Haynesville tends to have higher breakeven costs, even though it is ideally situated for LNG exports.However, KRP has seen the rigs on its Haynesville land hold pretty steady, with its acreage up 6 rigs in Q1 and then down 4 rigs in Q2. Given the overall drop in rig activity in the basin, this is a big positive for the company.Discussing the Haynesville on its , CFO Davis Ravnaas said:Outside of energy prices, acquisitions is another area of opportunity for the company. KRP views itself as a natural consolidator of mineral rights, noting that the market in about $660 billion in size, but there is only a limited number of public companies operating at scale. It thinks with the weak IPO market that it should be able to make acquisitions as private sponsors look for avenues to exit their past mineral investments.Since its IPO, KRP has closed on 10 major M&A transactions, investing over $1.7 billion in the process. Its latest transaction closed last month, when it acquired oil and gas mineral and royalty assets in the Permian and Mid-Continent for $455 million from a private seller.The company said in terms of total proved value, 64% of the value is from the Permian and the rest is from the Mid-Con. It expects next-twelve-month production of about 4,765 Boe/d, with the cut 33% oil, 26% NGLs, and 41% natural gas. It projects the assets to generate $64.3 million in cash flow at current strip pricing as of the end of July, representing just over a 7x multiple.KRP financed the deal through the sale of $325 million 6% convertible notes it sold to Apollo. It also sold 8.3 million units in a secondary offering for gross proceeds of $116.7 million.As a result of the deal, its daily production will increase 28% to 22.4 Mboe/d, while its rig count will rise 11%. It expects the deal to reduce G&A per barrel by -22%. Over 40% of its total net locations will now be in the Permian.KRP does carry debt, but its pro-forma leverage was only 1.0x after the acquisition. Any type of debt when looking at companies involved in energy production is a risk, but right now it looks minimal, and KRP has been able to fund acquisitions through other methods, including equity and convertible securities that carry lower interest rates.KRP currently trades at about 8.7x the 2023 EBITDA consensus of $238 million. Based on 2024 EBITDA it trades at 6.1x given that the EBITDA consensus for that year is $338 million and reflects a full year of its recent acquisition. These valuations reflect its current share count and convertible issuance.The stock currently has a free cash flow yield of about 14.4% based on my estimate for 2024.The stock pays out a variable dividend, but is currently yielding about 9.6% based on its last payout of 39 cents per share. Given the difference in its current yield and the FCF yield I project for 2024, it should have some nice room to increase its dividend next year.KRP is a solid mineral rights owner that is becoming more tied to the Permian with its recent acquisition. Given that the Permian is the most prolific basin in the U.S. with the best growth prospects, I’d view that as a positive. Its Haynesville exposure carries some risk but has been holding up well, and gives it some natural gas price potential upside.I continue to think natural gas prices should rebound over the medium term, as demand continues to naturally increase while higher-cost production is cut back on. However, a warmer winter in parts of the country due to an El Nino could keep prices in check in the near term, but we'll have to wait and see how the weather plays out. Southern states, though, will usually be colder during an El Nino, which could help with regional prices in places like Texas and the Gulf Coast.Overall, I like KRP and think it is currently a “Buy.” My price target is $20, which a 7x multiple on its 2025 EBITDA, to go along with about $1.60+ in dividends.

Vale S.A.: Higher Production And Solid Financials Bring Bright Future,"Vale S.A. () is a prominent global producer of the metals and mining industry. The company is operating in diverse segments of iron ore, nickel, copper, platinum group metals (PGMs), gold, silver, and cobalt. In my previous During , the management completed 69% of their share buyback program, which started in 2021. In the case of copper and nickel production, the company surpassed its production levels considerably. Copper production surged by 41% year over yearDuring 2H 2022 and 1H 2023, iron ore and nickel prices plunged, and they were the main reasons for lower operating cash generation and EBITDA amounts in 2Q 2023 versus 2Q 2022. In the second quarter of 2023, VALE’s operating cash flow plunged deeply to $1.9 billion year over year compared with $3.3 billion in 2Q 2022, which mainly was due to a $15 per ton lower iron ore price and a $3000 per ton lower nickel price since the second quarter of 2022. As I will discuss in detail, iron ore prices are anticipated to decline further during the rest of 2023 and even further fall in the long term. I consider a more conservative price of $80 per ton for iron ore by the end of 2023 to be realistic. It is worth noting that the iron ore all-in cost for the company is anticipated to be between $52-54 per ton by the end of 2023, leaving approximately $25 per ton of revenue in iron ore production.Moreover, their capital expenditures of $1.20 billion remained almost the same as the previous year of $1.21 billion and higher than $1.15 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2023. This higher CapEx was due to 7 million tons of higher iron ore sales volumes that caused an increase in working capital. As a result, led to $690 million of free cash flow (see Figure 1).Figure 1 – VALE’s cash structure (in millions)Regarding VALE’s capital structure, we can see that their net debt is inclined, and that was mostly because the company announced to distribute $1.74 billion to shareholders in September 2023 and raised $1.5 billion from bond issuance to repurchase $1.4 billion of shares. As a result, their net debt level sat at $11.4 billion at the end of the recent quarter versus $11.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Moreover, lower commodity processes offset higher production partially and led to $5 billion of cash generation that despite being higher than the first quarter of $4.7 billion, is less than year over year $7.3 billion in 2Q 2022. Thankfully, VALE’s equity level is far higher than its debt level, which provides a solid opportunity for more financing and shareholder distributions. The equity has surged considerably during the last year, reaching over $40 billion in 2Q 2023 versus $37 billion in 2Q 2022 (see Figure 2).Figure 2 – Capital structure (in millions)Vale’s production and revenues are highly dependent on China’s economic recovery as the company is one of the prominent producers of iron ore, and China is its largest importer. As you may know, China uses iron ore for real estate and industrial park developments. As a result, what begs the question is how fast the company will recover and increase back to its previous economic growth condition.Figure 3 – China real GDP trendWith China’s recovery process, how will the iron ore prices move during the coming years? After a great fall of more than 50% in iron ore prices in the second half of 2022, this market experienced a boost in prices in early 2023 after China’s reopening. However, it goes with no surprise that the boost is expected to ease during the following years, hence reaching a new balance between slower demand and higher supply. As Figure 2 – Iron ore outlookThankfully, Vale’s diversified productions bring outstanding opportunities for the company to take advantage of the energy transition process in the world. For example, the main portion of Electric Vehicles and offshore wind instruments are from nickel and copper, and Vale has a prominent production facility in these minerals. The management is taking the most advantage of their energy transition metal (ETM) opportunities and investing $25-30 million in the following years to grow their copper production from 350 kilotons per year to 900 kilotons per year. Also, nickel production is planned to surge from 175 kilotons yearly to 300 kilotons yearly.The main risk associated with VALE's performance is related to China’s economic recovery because China is the company’s largest iron ore importer. China’s government is required to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. Apart from China, slower economic growth will adversely impact demand for iron ore. Although the inflation rates are heading to lower levels and central banks have no reason to keep high interest rates, we do not know if lower interest rates will come soon. Thus, I consider lower revenue for VALE by the end of 2023.Notwithstanding lower prices in iron ore during the second quarter of 2023 versus the same time last year, the company has invested in higher production levels during the next decade. Thus partially offset the effects of lower prices. VALE’s business is well diversified which will bring bright opportunities for the company’s growth in each business section. For example, their ETM business is improving successfully to meet mineral demand to take advantage of the energy transition process in the world. For example, the main portion of Electric Vehicles and offshore wind instruments are from nickel and copper, and Vale has a prominent production facility in these minerals. Moreover, VALE’s financials are solid and healthy enough to cater to a reliable investment opportunity. As a result, I believe that a buy rating is still appropriate for VALE stock.

American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings: Unconvincing EV Transition,"Our current investment thesis is:American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. () is a leading global automotive supplier that designs, engineers, and manufacturesAXL’s share price performance has been disappointing, losing over 60% of its value while the S&P 500 has made impressive gains. This is a reflection of the company’s declining financial performance and industry headwinds.Presented above are AXL's financial results.AXL’s revenue development has been disappointing despite the +7% CAGR on the top line, primarily due to minimal organic growth and heavy weighting toward the .AXL manufactures a broad range of driveline and drivetrain systems, including axles and power transfer units, catering to various vehicle types, including SUVs, trucks, electric vehicles, and commercial vehicles. It collaborates closely with automotive manufacturers during the design and development phase, creating tailored and scalable solutions. Additionally, AXL provides aftermarket services, including replacement parts. This additional revenue stream enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty, while boosting its non-cyclical revenue capabilities.The company has developed a strong reputation within the market globally, owing to its market-leading products that in many cases are noticeably superior to its peers’ alternatives. This has allowed AXL to create relationships with several leading OEMs globally.AXL operates manufacturing facilities and engineering centers globally, allowing it to efficiently serve clients across all key regions by adapting to local demands and regulations. When assessed by Backlog, the company’s business by region is broadly equal between Asia, Europe, and the Americas. This is a reflection of its market-leading technology in the traditional ICE-powered market. Most recently, the company has own multiple contracts with OEMs in Europe and China.AXL has invested significantly in R&D (which is one of the reasons for its margin erosion), with a current focus on innovative technologies in the EV space, such as electric driveline systems and lightweight materials. AXL is committed to lightweight components and electric driveline systems, contributing to the fuel-efficient objectives of OEMs. This is a critical requirement for the business in order to ensure it stays competitive in the evolving automotive industry that appears to be undergoing an unstoppable transition to electric only.We are currently unconvinced by AXL’s transition efforts. Despite the industry being in a rapid upswing and production accelerating, only 40% of AXL’s backlog is currently weighted toward EVs. Further, the company has yet to develop a key advantage over its peers that would allow for a market-leading position in a similar vein to its current position. This is compounded by the risk of OEMs producing comparable products for EVs in-house. Realistically, AXL will be a strong market participant but we believe there is significant risk associated with replicating its existing business. We believe the broader LPV production slowdown as weighting moves toward EVs is going to be a major concern for the company as it loses on the ICE side and faces greater competition on the EV side.The auto parts industry is expected to experience a continuation of its recent uptick in growth, with a . AXL faces competition from and operates alongside, several key parts players, including GKN Automotive, Magna International (), Dana Incorporated (), Autoliv (), and Genpact (). This growth trajectory will be driven by strong demand from the APAC region, as producers in China (in particular) seek to take advantage of their strong EV innovation to penetrate the global automotive industry. Furthermore, technological development and innovation will have a material impact on consumer spending, as the ability of automakers to differentiate will increase. We struggle to see AXL meeting this growth rate, as it has yet to sufficiently tether its growth to the EV segment while facing the downside issues.AXL’s margins have trended down during the last decade, particularly in the post-FY16 period. This is a disappointing development given the significant increase in scale following the acquisition of MPG. The company has been unable to deliver on the synergies and cost savings expected on a normalized basis. The positive for AXL is that its pre-pandemic level (above NI) was strong, with much of the recent decline attributed to macro/industry conditions (supply chain issues contributing to reduced production).AXL’s recent performance has been respectable given the current macro environment, with revenue growth of +26.6%, +12.8%, +4.0%, and +9.2% in its last four quarters. In conjunction with this, margins have continued to slide, with an LTM EBITDA-M of 12%.The company’s growth performance is respectable, however, looks to be achieved through negative pricing action and continued inflationary pressure, contributing to a decline in EBITDA since FY22. We are generally not supportive of such actions, as in highly competitive industries such as this, the ability to subsequently win back margins can be difficult. We attribute this to AXL’s declining competitive positioning.Key takeaways from its most recent quarter are:Looking ahead, we suspect the company will face a revenue slowdown, owing to the broader macro environment. The automotive industry has boasted resilience thus far, primarily due to the unwind of supply chain issues contributing to unmet demand being fulfilled. This offsetting impact is rapidly subsiding. As the following data illustrates, LVP is forecast to decline in the coming quarter, driven in large part by the Chinese market. We suspect this will begin impacting other regions too by the end of the year.For these reasons, we believe revenue will decline in the coming quarter, although likely not substantially so. It is critical for AXL to protect its margins, although we are again hesitant of this.AXL has maintained a bloated balance sheet since its acquisition of MPG, with ND/EBITDA exceeding 3x since Dec17. We do not consider the current level concerning, as its interest coverage is borderline reasonable (as evidenced by historical levels). This said, its inability to rapidly deleverage is a concern and will mean cash continues to be tied up rather than distributed to shareholders.Speaking of cash flows, AXL’s FCF margin has struggled to improve, operating significantly below the company’s EBITDA margin. This said, as it moves directionally with profitability, its cash flow generation is now highly unattractive and problematic for its long-term objectives.The company’s ROE profile compounds criticism of its operating performance. AXL’s profitability has been highly volatile, with no genuine scope for normalization due to the commercial concerns ahead. This makes it incredibly difficult to forecast the level of future investor returns through earnings.Presented above is Wall Street's consensus view on the coming 5 years.Analysts are forecasting a worsening of its commercial position, contributing to a stagnation of revenue into FY26F. In conjunction with this, margins are expected to remain broadly flat, although slightly improved from the current LTM levels.We are supportive of the assumptions made. We are completely unconvinced by the technological developments currently underway, contributing to a reliance on traditional ICE-powered vehicles. Due to this, the expectation is that as production transitions toward EVs, revenue growth potential will rapidly diminish. It is worth highlighting that the company could successfully innovate itself out of this mess and is trying its best to do so, but based on the current evidence, we are not confident.Margins assumptions also appear reasonable. As a market-leading business, it is unlikely to see a material change, with scope for some improvement coming from supply chain improvements.Presented above is a comparison of AXL's growth and profitability to the average of its industry, as defined by Seeking Alpha (27 companies).AXL’s performance is disappointing relative to its peers. The company’s growth has lagged its peers across every time frame, in both revenue and profitability. This is a reflection of slowing light vehicle production growth in favor of more EVs, as well as its declining commercial standing.The company’s margins are slightly better, with an EBITDA-M and FCF outperformance. This said, this is a reflection of its historical business model, which does not translate well into how the market is transitioning. Although margins are unlikely to be affected in the coming 5 years, beyond this we could see greater pressure.AXL is currently trading at 5x LTM EBITDA and 4x NTM EBITDA. This is a discount to its historical average.A discount to its historical average is warranted in our view, owing to the decline in the company’s financial performance and commercial attractiveness. At a low multiple, it appears investors have priced in the long-term concerns for an extended period, yet we still feel the current discount is not sufficient.Further, the company is currently trading at a substantial discount to its peer group, with a 119% discount on an LTM EBITDA basis and a 17% discount on a NTM P/E basis. A discount is undoubtedly warranted in our view, reflecting the poor future outlook and weakness in growth thus far.Risk-taking investors may see an opportunity with a depressed valuation such as this, particularly with an FCF yield in excess of 20%. This must be contextualized, however. Its average FCF yield is close to 20%, yet investors have seen almost none of it since FY13, with a substantial unconvincing acquisition and investment in electrification that has no evidence of future repayment.The key risks to our current thesis (outside of innovating its way to a market-leading position) are:AXL is facing significant threats to its business model, as the automotive industry transitions to EVs. The company is a leading player in the existing market, with strong relationships and deep expertise. For this reason, we do believe it will have some success in growing within the EV segment, however, we do not currently see it maintaining its existing relative position.Compounding our negative views are the lack of distributions, poor performance relative to its peers, and the potential for weakening financial performance in the near term.

B2Gold Q2 Earnings: Solid Results Overshadowed By Potential Mining Law Changes,"The Q2 Earnings Season has been a mixed one thus far for the Gold Miners Index (), but  () is one name that delivered solid results yet still suffered a negative reaction following However, while this is undoubtedly a negative for B2Gold, it's much less negative if this applies to new projects (not existing mines like Fekola), and this news has already shaved nearly $1.0 billion in market cap off the stock, a far greater figure than the value of a 15% participating interest in Fekola Regional. So, while B2Gold is reporting lower margins and free cash flow in a higher-cost year with elevated sustaining capital, I see this pullback in the stock being overdoneB2Gold released its  this week, reporting quarterly production of ~262,700 ounces of gold (including ~16,700 ounces from its Calibre interest), an improvement from the year-ago period. The increased production was helped by higher mined grades at Fekola, despite production coming in slightly below budget at ~152,400 ounces, with lower grades than planned. This was a material improvement from average processed grades of 1.71 grams per tonne of gold, affected by stockpile usage and elevated waste stripping as it waited to gain access to high-grade Phase 6 ore.And besides higher production at its flagship Fekola Mine in Mali, Otjikoto also benefited from higher grades from Wolfshag Underground, with mining rates of ~1,000 tonnes per day at 4.0+ gram per tonne gold grades supplementing feed from the Otjikoto Pit. Notably, Otjikoto's production should be back-end weighted (40%/60%) in FY2023, so we should see a step up in production from the Namibian mine vs. its ~44,100 ounces produced in Q2.Digging into Fekola's production a little closer, the company processed ~2.32 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.24 grams per tonne of gold, up from 1.71 grams per tonne of gold in the year-ago period. However, this was lower than expected related to the delayed receipt of a mine production excavator, lower than planned mine production due to blast hole drilling inefficiencies, and lower than planned recoveries on the higher-grade feed. That said, the mine still remains on track to meet its annual guidance, and is tracking well against guidance with ~318,300 ounces produced in H1 2023.As for costs, Fekola's all-in sustaining costs came in at $1,165/oz which was a 23% increase from the year-ago period. However, it's important to note that this was largely related to higher sustaining capital (including $21 million for mobile equipment and rebuilds), with sustaining capital more than quadrupling to ~$59.0 million year-over-year (Q2 2022: ~$14.1 million) and much fewer ounces sold than produced (~142,900 vs. ~~152,400).As for B2Gold's sales, the company reported revenue of $470.9 million (+24% year-over-year) on the sale of ~239,100 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,969/oz. This was up sharply from the year-ago period due to the higher production levels and contributed to operating cash flow of ~$199 million, also up materially from the year-ago period. However, with significantly higher investment at Fekola (~$74 million) and the Goose Project (~$69 million), B2Gold reported a cash outflow of ~$10 million in the period on the back of $205 million in capex.This was abnormal for this consistent free cash flow generator, but it's important to note that this is a period of unusually high investment and the company will revert to being a free cash flow machine in FY2025 with spending at Goose winding down following first gold pour in Q1 2025 and reduced sustaining capital at Fekola.Moving over to costs and margins, B2Gold reported cash costs of $777/oz in Q2 and all-in sustaining costs [AISC] of $1,214/oz. While cash costs were down year-over-year from easy comps of $888/ooz in Q2 2022, AISC increased over 9%, denting B2Gold's AISC margins on a sequential basis ($759/oz in Q2 2023 vs. $841/oz in Q1 2023). This was despite the benefit of a higher average realized gold price ($1,969/oz), and this margin compression in a robust period for the gold price may have alarmed some investors.However, it's important to note that this is due to the elevated sustaining capital spend this year and while year-to-date AISC has come in much higher than investors have been accustomed to, 2023 is an unusual year from a cost standpoint due to the elevated sustaining capital, with elevated capital stripping expenses expected to drop considerably in 2024.Looking at the below chart of margins, B2Gold's AISC margins have slipped to $759/oz, but they still came in above the industry average in the period, and year-to-date AISC is sitting at $1,128/oz, below the guidance range of $1,195/oz to $1,255/oz, implying a higher-cost H2 but signaling a likely  vs. the guidance midpoint of $1,225/oz, in line with B2Gold's strong track record of over-delivering on promises. The lower costs benefited from lower than budgeted diesel prices and heavy fuel oil costs, in line with what we have heard from commentary on other conference calls sector-wide. So, while AISC margins could continue to decline on a sequential basis into the back half of the year, I don't see any reason to be discouraged by this, with all-in sustaining costs expected to improve materially in 2024.In fact, as the chart below highlights, all-in sustaining costs could come in above $1,200/oz this year (lower end of guidance), but are likely to improve to $1,125/oz or better in 2024 with more normalized sustaining capital spend. And if we look ahead to 2025, B2Gold will benefit from at least two quarters of commercial production from the high-margin Goose Mine (sub $800/oz costs in first five years), which should contribute to sub $1,050/oz AISC in 2025.This will make B2Gold one of the lowest-cost producers sector-wide, and place its costs over 20% below the estimated FY2025 industry average of ~$1,350/oz. And even more importantly, the combination of lower sustaining and growth capital plus a similar production profile (Goose more than offsetting Otjikoto which is winding down post-2024) and higher margins will lead to a significant increase in free cash flow generation from 2025 going forward.As for recent developments, the negative one that has weighed on B2Gold is that the Mali Mining code could boost state and local interest to 35%, up from 20% currently (10% with the option to acquire another 10% stake). If this applied to the Fekola Mine which is a ~600,000 ounce producer, this would certainly be a very negative development. However, B2Gold noted the following in its Q2 Conference Call:- B2Gold CEO, Clive Johnson, Q2 2023 .This is positive news if correct, suggesting that the higher ownership only applies to tenements outside of the existing mining license for Fekola from the 2012 Mining Code, and this cannot be increased to 35%. And while it's certainly negative that the Anaconda area and surrounding tenements could be subject to a 15% increase in interest, this is a much smaller hit in my view and does not justify anywhere near the ~$1.0+ billion decline we've seen in B2Gold's valuation over the past month.Hence, while an increase to 35% interest is negative relative to what the picture looked like a month ago before news was released about the new 2023 Mali Mining code, I see this as only moderately negative as long as it doesn't impact B2Gold's interest in the Fekola Mine. For now, the receipt of the exploration license for the Bantako North permit is outstanding, given that it's pending the finalization of the new 2023 Mining Code.In other news, the Goose Project in Nunavut (recently acquired from Sabina) remains on track for Q1 2025 first gold production, and the production profile has been optimized with the potential for 300,000+ ounces in the first five years, which would make the mine one of the top-10 largest gold producers in Canada and one of the top-5 highest-margin assets in Canada. And while the increase in expected capex from ~$460 million under Sabina to ~$670 million is negative, this was largely to be expected given inflationary pressures we've seen sector-wide and scope changes (including accelerated underground development).As it stands, cost to completion is sitting at ~$410 million which is easily covered by B2Gold's ~$1.2 billion in liquidity. It's also worth noting that B2Gold has approved a $20 million exploration budget on regional targets, which could be a major value add for this asset which has excess permitted processing capacity (6,000 tonnes per day vs. 4,000 tonnes per day planned processing rate).Let's dig into B2Gold's valuation following its sharp correction:Based on ~1,330 billion fully diluted shares and a share price of US$3.05, B2Gold trades at a market cap of ~$4.06 billion and an enterprise value of ~$3.61 billion. This makes B2Gold one of the most attractively valued million-ounce gold producers, especially when we compare it to names like  () at a ~65% higher enterprise value and much more leveraged vs. B2Gold's strong financial position (net cash: ~$450 million).That said, B2Gold is in the unfavorable position of having significant concentration to non Tier-1 jurisdictions which have can weigh on its multiples, even if these issues haven't caused the company any issues recently (outside of brief uncertainty surrounding its Menankoto exploration permit that's since been resolved). However, the most recent development is more significant, as discussed above, with the possibility that the Malian government could boost interest in projects to 35%, potentially reducing B2Gold's share of profits from its stand-alone Anaconda opportunity it's actively looking at potentially developing.The good news is that the company made a timely bid to acquire Sabina Gold & Silver at a very attractive price, adding a massive land package in Nunavut and a project that will head into production by early 2025. This has taken care of the upcoming production cliff at Otjikoto with this asset set to wind down by 2025, added a new high-margin asset in what's regarded as a Tier-1 jurisdiction, and partially reduced its exposure to Tier-2/Tier-3 ranked jurisdictions. And given these developments and that Goose is now just 18 months from first gold pour with an optimized production profile (~300,000 ounces for the first five years), I believe a more reasonable multiple for the stock is 8.5x cash flow (a premium to its historical multiple), and more in line with the ranges for other million-ounce producer peers. If we apply this figure to B2Gold's FY2024 cash flow per share estimates of $0.58, this points to a fair value of US$4.95 - 62% upside from current levels.While this represents a significant upside to fair value, I am looking for a minimum 40% discount to fair value for mid-cap producers, pointing to an updated ideal buy zone of US$2.97 or lower for the stock. This is slightly below the stock's current levels, but investors can take comfort because they are also pocketing one of the industry's most attractive dividend yields by owning B2Gold, enjoying a ~5.2% annualized dividend yield.So, on a total return basis to its 18-month target price (US$4.95), B2Gold's return is closer to 67%, making it one of the better reward/risk setups in the sector today. And while the company will lag its peers from a free cash flow generation standpoint over the next 18 months while it builds Goose, its free cash flow will come roaring back in FY2025, with the potential to generate upwards of $600 million in FY2025 free cash flow (depending on the timing of a stand-alone Anaconda build) leaving the stock trading at less than 7x FY2025 EV/FCF.B2Gold has slid considerably from its year-to-date highs, and while this might make sense if the Mali mining code was potentially clawing back an extra 15% interest from its existing Fekola Mine and all other tenements and the company had just come off a highly dilutive acquisition. However, neither of these appears to be the case. As highlighted by B2Gold's CEO, Clive Johnson, in recent remarks, the potential for an extra 15% interest does not apply to its 80/20 ownership of Fekola, but Fekola Regional instead.And on the second point, this was a minimally dilutive acquisition that could create enormous shareholder value, and potentially end up being one of the smartest deals done sector-wide in a while. This is because there's the possibility of a second mine down the road on the company's massive 80 kilometer belt with multiple gold deposits in iron formations and a 2.5x larger iron formation at George. And the latter didn't get the attention it deserved, given that it was under the umbrella of a gold developer in a tough market, with Sabina choosing to preserve cash and not drill aggressively to minimize share dilution.So, with B2Gold trading at one of the highest FY2025 free cash flow yields sector-wide, having multiple impressive sleeper assets in its development portfolio  the Nunavut land package that it's not getting credit for (JV in Finland, Gramalote JV that's likely to be sold, added production from a stand-alone operation at Anaconda, and greenfield opportunities in Uzbekistan and Cote d'Ivoire, the stock seems unfairly punished near US$3.00 per share. This is especially true when it will be one of the lowest-cost gold producers post-2025 with the exceptional future Goose Mine in production, with all-in sustaining costs likely to be below $850/oz even adjusting for inflation.In summary, with a more diversified portfolio that's finally got some Tier-1 exposure and the share price back to the depressed levels it hasn't visited since Q3 2022, I see this correction in B2Gold Corp. stock providing a relatively low-risk buying opportunity.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Falling Car Prices Leave Ally Financial Without Proper Collateral,"2023 has been a particularly challenging year for the banking sector. As the economy moves entirely past COVID-related issues, most of the financial stimulus created in 2020 is rapidly unwinding. Interest rates are much higher while the money supply is falling quickly, creating liquidityOne of the more unique larger banks is Ally Financial (). Last year, I was among the few investors with a  on ALLY due to what I perceived as excessive exposure to an unstable auto loan market. Since then, ALLY has lost around 18% of its value as investors brace for increased loan losses related toRisks aside, Ally is much cheaper than most bank stocks, with a lower forward ""P/E"" of 8X, accounting for a significant expected decline in the bank's income. Its dividend yield is also higher at 4.6%, while its price-to-book is lower at 0.7X. On most measures, its valuation is around  than the financials sector, indicating opportunity should its fundamental prospects recover. ALLY has also been in a trading range for most of the past year, losing value well ahead of most other banks. Accordingly, ALLY is a notable company because it may give us insight into the future path of bank stocks due to its elevated cyclical exposure.Ally is different than all other banks because it has incredibly high exposure to the auto market. , it has around $113B in auto-related assets or roughly 60% of its total assets. Of those, $84B are retail auto loans with a high average yield of 8.8%. Aside from auto loans, Ally has around $50B in mortgages and securities (most of which are mortgages). The bank also has tiny consumer lending segments, which it expects to grow, currently totaling around $4B. Overall, its portfolio has a higher weighted average yield of 7%, giving it a stronger 3.38% net interest margin. That figure is higher than most other banks, benefiting its profitability but increasing its exposure to economic cycles.Ally's greatest risk is a significant and broad increase in auto loan defaults. Total US auto loan debt skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021 due to a surge in vehicle prices and a large, and likely temporary, increase in people's  due to stimulus and savings benefits seen in 2020. Vehicle production levels limited auto sales, now recovering to pre-COVID levels. Due to the massive increase in personal household savings in 2020, auto loan defaults have been very low but are now back near normal. See below:The massive increase in auto loan demand and the decline in defaults were significant for ALLY, causing the bank to double in value from 2019 to its 2021 peak. However, it has erased all of those gains since investors began to brace for the fact that stimulus efforts artificially created the 2020-2021 benefits and would not continue suppressing default rates.Ally has faced a relatively steady increase in auto loan delinquencies over the past year. , its 30-day delinquency rate was around 2.5%, rising to 3.6% in 2Q 2023. Ally has tightened lending standards accordingly, with its approval rate falling from 35% to 29% and its weighted average FICO rising from 685 to 701 over the same period. Nonprime loans account for 9% of its loans, down from 11% in 2Q 2022. Since I covered the stock last, the company has made efforts to reduce its exposure to the economic cycle; however, will these measures be enough or ""too little too late""?For one, although its lending standards have improved, we must remember that its weighted average FICO on loans is below the national average of . The bank is essentially lending to the average American, who is not necessarily financially healthy. Although real median wages per hour have stopped falling, total  household incomes continue to slide consistently as total working hours decline. Personal savings remain below normal at , indicating that most households are still struggling with disproportionately rising costs. As  (), many families have become highly reliant on credit card debt to maintain discretionary spending levels, with falling credit metrics implying many have maxed out this segment in recent months.Regarding Ally, we must consider the fact that there is a considerable lag between economic trends and defaults due to the stimulus efforts in 2020. The vast 2020 savings boom (due to stimulus and forced consumption declines in vacation, etc.) led to excellent consumer credit levels. Of course, this was followed by stagnating wages and massive household cost growth that  all pandemic-era savings. As of the past few months, US households are in worse financial conditions than in 2019 as savings levels return to 2019, with median real family income around . Of course, real median family income would be lower if we assume the consumer price index does not entirely account for . Over the next month, consumer stability will decline as Federal  begin again; however, I expect most will stop paying those loans before vehicle loans.There are also specific issues in the auto lending market. Specifically, most of Ally's loans are likely on vehicles that may decline in value. Due to low supply, vehicle prices skyrocketed in 2020-2022 but are now falling today. See below:Ally saw significant loan portfolio growth when vehicle prices were at a peak. Dealer's used and new car prices are around 30% below peak levels. Crucially, this means the LTVs on its loans are much higher than at origination. To make matters worse, many auto lenders offered loans at LTVs well over that period. Such loans are particularly problematic because, in the event of default, Ally may only receive ~50 cents on the dollar or less due as the ""securitized"" asset is worth so much less than the original loan. The reality is that Ally's loans are not nearly as ""secured"" as many expect. Further, due to the massive increase in  costs due to prices and interest rates, the probability of default may be widely underestimated in the event of a recession or unemployment increase.The probability of a recession, based on statistical models, is the highest it's been since the 1980s. See below:According to this model (""Estrella and Mishkin""), the probability of a recession in 2024 is 66%. That is much higher than the 2000, 2008, and 2020 recession odds. That leaves a 33% probability that no recession will occur, so it is certainly not a ""sure thing"" that Ally's delinquency rate will continue to rise due to problematic factors. However, a significant default increase could push Ally Bank toward insolvency due to its excess auto loan exposure and the lack of actual securitization of those loans (due to falling car prices). Currently, Ally's tangible book value is only 5.2% of its total assets, so it would not take a massive increase in defaults to wipe out its equity. See below:The sharp decline in Ally's book value is mainly because all of its securities are listed as ""available for sale"" instead of ""held to maturity,"" so it had to declare losses for all its securities even though it had not realized those losses. Compared to most banks, Ally's exposure to the securities market is lower. However, it remains a remaining portfolio risk because mortgage rates are still rising (most of its securities are mortgage-backed). So, it should face more book value declines in Q3 related to that issue.Ally has fared better than most prominent banks regarding deposits and liquidity, seeing its deposits stagnate instead of falling. I expect that banks will continue to face deposit strains if the Federal Reserve does not pursue QE because the total money supply is declining. That said, because Ally's CDs and savings rates are around , many savers prefer it to the many other large banks that continue to pay nothing on savings. Thus, the falling M2 does not pose balance sheet risks to Ally but will certainly cause its net interest margin to contract over the coming quarters. Still, that is not as great a risk for Ally as most because its NIM is naturally elevated due to its focus on higher-risk loans.Ally is also exposed to consumer mortgage loans, not to be confused with securitized mortgage-backed securities. Ally has $19.3B in such loans, carrying a weighted average yield of  in Q2 2023. Since those loans are not securities, their value is not ""marked-to-market."" However, because their yield is 3.22%, we know that those mortgages were created before the increase in mortgage rates, . If Ally were to sell those mortgages, it would likely sell at a similar loss to its mortgage securities since they'd need a market-rate yield. Ally's mortgage securities lost ~16% of their value from amortized cost to fair value (10-Q pg. 18). Assuming the same losses would occur to fair value on its mortgage loans, its expected loss would be ~$3B. Ally's tangible book value was $10.3B at the end of Q2, likely closer to $7.3B if we account for unrealized off-balance sheet devaluation of its mortgage loans.Thus, accounting for the estimated fair value of its assets, Ally's market capitalization of $7.95B is likely its actual tangible equity value. The unrealized losses on its securities and mortgage loans are not a huge issue if it manages to hold these assets to maturity, which would take a few decades. However, if it faces financial pressure related to auto loan losses, it would likely need to sell these assets at fair value, rapidly causing a decline in its ""CET1"" ratio and other solvency measures because a significant portion of its assets face unrealized losses. At the asset's estimated fair value, its tangible equity would only be worth around 3.7% of its assets (7.3 over 195). Of course, because mortgage rates have risen again in Q3, that figure is likely an overestimation.Accounting for the fair value of mortgage loans, Ally is trading at or above its true liquidation value, so it is not discounted. Its income will likely decline due to a sharp increase in borrowing costs this quarter and last. Thus, Ally is likely trading near its fair value or potentially slightly above it without a recession. However, should a recession occur, it is among the most exposed due to its huge exposure to auto loans that likely have LTVs well over 100%, given falling vehicle values. In my opinion, based on the data, Ally does not have adequate solvency to face such pressures. Although its CET1 ratio is decent at ~9.3%, allowing it to pass ""stress tests"" (note, ), that figure fails to account for its significant unrealized losses and the likely poor securitization of its auto loans (due to falling used car prices). Of course, if a recession occurs and auto defaults rise, then used car prices would fall even faster as the market is flooded with repo vehicles.Since I believe a recession is relatively likely to occur over the next twelve months, I remain very bearish on Ally. Without a recession, I expect ALLY to stay around its current level; thus, although bearish, I would not bet against it today. However, in the event of a recession, I expect Ally will face insolvency before most other banks, potentially causing the stock to lose most or all of its value. Now, I want to be clear that  stating that Ally will go bankrupt or even that is necessarily likely. The reality is that Ally, although seemingly overleveraged and poorly diversified, is likely a ""too big to fail"" lender due to its size and its dominance in the auto market. Given that, it could receive government aid and stimulus if its solvency declines significantly. Once again, that adds to my reasons why I would not short Ally, though I strongly suspect it will lose value over the next year.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Ring Energy: Getting That Corporate Breakeven Down,"Ring Energy () began with a great idea to acquire some very profitable leases and then operate those leases to build a company that someone would want to purchase (hopefully at a big premium). However, covid challenges got in the wayMore importantly,  a debt repayment of $25 million dollars for the second quarter. The fact that this company can repay debt at all with oil prices considerably lower is a major accomplishment over the previous fiscal year. It very much looked to Mr. Market like negative cash flow was in store for the current year. Never mind that most commodity industries generally adjust to rapidly changing prices on a regular basis. Nor did Mr. Market consider the effects of the hedging program in the two comparison years. Instead, it was a ""straight up"" decision that lower prices would hurt the company badly.Instead, management announced debt progress that was aided by a noncore lease sale. It is very likely that once recession fears fade, this company will receive a better reception from the market than is the case right now.Management does have a  of improving ratios. That is definitely a first step.What the market wants to see is conservative ratios using much lower assumed selling prices. So, the market will be watching for debt progress during the current year when selling prices have declined.Since these wells breakeven at lower prices, then spreading fixed costs over more production automatically will lower the corporate breakeven price. That means the company will make money at lower selling prices from this acquisition even before low breakevens and other benefits are considered.Generally, any new company looks for an optimal production level that maximizes corporate profitability. Ring Energy was well on its way to that when oil prices went negative. So, management did what many managements did and literally went further by shutting all production in and ""living off the hedge program"" until the oil price recovery was well underway. But ""living off the hedges"" did not impress Mr. Market because Mr. Market does not value hedge income at all. So, the price of the stock sank to some unthinkable levels.Now, finally, the debt market is slowly thinking about relaxing a little (very little). The company actually managed to increase its liquidity as a result of the stronghold acquisition. Next, the priority has to be to get ratios that the market is comfortable with. Management now appears to be well on its way thanks to the acquired production.The market gets qualms about any step backwards (like the one shown above in the first quarter) even if the reasons were well established ahead of time. Further holding back the price is the worry about the debt payment progress shown above. It really was too small for the amount of debt. to improve the situation with an all-cash acquisition. The lenders' reaction has yet to be fully determined. Now if they like it, there may be a bank line expansion that follows. The lenders generally accept accretive acquisitions for companies to improve debt ratios.It was indeed a very big deal that the debt is now around $425 million (give or take) which is much less than double the previous amount given that production has doubled. The latest transaction would get the debt levels closer to a double. But there is a whole lot more production to service that double. Even more important is all the low-cost reworks that could prove to boost profitability in the near future.Of course, Mr. Market wants proof. So, management will have to execute properly. But that execution requires nothing extraordinary. In fact, management had some slides in the first quarter earnings package that showed some preliminary results. That (of course) needs to be followed up with expected decline rates, fast paybacks, and then some reasonable profitability. But since this is what management has been doing all along, the risk of an unpleasant outcome is very low.The market is well aware that commodity selling prices are ""ahem"" not quite what they were last year. But those ""not quite"" prices were prices we were all praying for back when it seemed like these prices were a dream.Now these prices are not as good as last year. ""Not as good"" has now been interpreted to be bad with worse on the way. It is amazing how what once would have been ""barn burner prices"" is now subpar (or worse).What  upon is the extent to which more very profitable production will drop the corporate breakeven to the point where the ratios please Mr. Market going forward. That will result in a higher valuation.Therefore, debt progress at these lower commodity prices are likely to be well received. Production growth is unlikely in the current fiscal year as management will likely assimilate the acquisition first. It takes time to get everything operating optimally while catching up with deferred maintenance that is typical for such sales.The whole idea here is that the sum of all the parts (the company and the acquisitions) is greater than when they were independent. For the market that will be shown as free cash flow that can be used to repay debt.The company has long drilled very profitable wells. It just did not have enough of those wells producing before the challenges of fiscal year 2020 hit.Even in fiscal year 2020, management was hedged enough that it could live comfortably off the hedging income while shutting production. But the market focused upon the shut-in production while really worrying about the hedging income as nonrecurring.What the market needs to realize is that the whole 2015-2020 period is unlikely to recur anytime soon. That means that the current recovery now occurring is likely to be far more normal than was the case in the 2015-2020 period. The rapid growth of the industry appears unlikely to resume.If debt progress is not sufficient for the market, then there could be another acquisition. But right now, many expect liquids prices to run higher in the second half of the fiscal year or in early 2024.This company is doing what it can to improve its situation no matter how the future turns out. The higher debt load makes this investment an above average risk but still a strong buy consideration. Generally, managements that do nothing are the ones that fail. This one is clearly taking action to improve its situation. Therefore, failure is probably off the table. Although a course correction or two is a possibility.Companies that resolve their issues generally provide above average returns combined with less risk than managements that ""sit there and take it"". Therefore, even though the debt load is considered high, investors should benefit from a reducing debt load combined with higher valuations from growth and greater recognition.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience. He has been focusing on this industry for years. He is a retired CPA, and holds an MBA and MA.

Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. (SDMHF) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2023 6:30 AM ETJoachim Kreuzburg - Chief Executive OfficerRainer Lehmann - Chief Financial OfficerRene Faber - Chief Executive Officer, Sartorius Stedim BiotechOdysseas Manesiotis - BerenbergVineet Agrawal - CitiRichard Vosser - JPMorganJames Quigley - Morgan StanleyJames Vane-Tempest - JefferiesOliver Metzger - ODDO BHFCharles Pitman - BarclaysSezgi Ozener - HSBCFalko Friedrichs - Deutsche BankPaul Knight - KeyBanc Capital MarketsOliver Reinberg - Kepler CheuvreuxDelphine Le Louet - Societe GeneraleGood day and welcome to the Sartorius and Sartorius Stedim Biotech Conference Call on the Nine Months 2023 Results. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg, CEO of Sartorius Group. Please go ahead, sir.Thank you very much and also hello and good day from my side. As always, I would like to kick it off by walking you through the highlights of the past three months and the nine months of 2023, and then Rainer will walk you through the detailed financial results for the Sartorius Group. And then after that, Rene, CEO of Sartorius Stedim Biotech, will talk about the Sartorius Stedim Biotech numbers and therefore, also highlighting the bioprocessing business in more detail as well.So again let me start by talking about the most important point over the last couple of months and weeks. So obviously and I think everyone is following the industry quite closely and seeing also the recent news flow from peers as well as from our customer segment. There are a couple of industry-wide headwinds that also have influenced the business development and particularly the top line development at SatoriusFor Bioprocess Solutions, we have seen signs of recovery. During Q3, we believe that we have seen the bottom of our order intake development most likely around end of Q2. So that's a positive one, but we see that the momentum is lower than initially expected.For the lab division, we have seen, and again, I think this is an industry-wide topic at the moment. A challenging Q3. It was more challenging than we anticipated particularly China and the US have to be mentioned here, where we saw lower investment activities and more cautious cash management by customers.Therefore, we also have seen some impact in regards to the bottom line. Our profitability has been impacted by those volume effects and also by some product mix effects. That is particularly the case for BPS and I think more details later during the call.Last week, a week ago, we have, therefore, adjusted and lowered our 2023 outlook in regards to the shift in percentages, a bit more in LPS, but also for the profitability. Again, unfortunately because of the momentum not being at a level that we had expected.For 2024, we are expecting profitable growth. And also for the midterm, nevertheless, we are reviewing our 2025 ambition and we'll give quantitative updates and guidance for both 2024 as well as for the midterm by the end of January next year when we'll publish our preliminary results for the year 2023.So, however, let me finish this part by saying we consider, as we always have underlined during the calls about the previous quarters. We consider the fundamental growth drivers to be intact. But at the same time, we clearly have to say that we still are in times with above average volatility in regards to demand, partially triggered by, let's say, segment external effects, particularly geopolitical and geoeconomical uncertainties and tensions.So and with that, I hand over to Rainer for the details.Thanks, Joachim. And also, first of all, welcome to today's earnings call from my side as well. Actually, it's going to be my last call in my current position, and I want to actually say a quick thank you for the good exchange over the last six years, and I'm sure we'll see each other on one of the other conference out there. So but now let's go back to business here and see what actually the first nine months performance was about.Sales revenue declined in constant currencies by 16.4% to EUR2.5 billion. Order intake decreased by 28% in constant currencies to EUR2.2 billion, clearly the reflection and of course, the result of lower-than-expected recovery. This led to an underlying EBITDA of EUR733 million, that's a margin of 30.3%, a decrease of 30.3% and a drop in margin by five percentage points to 28.8%.The underlying earnings per share for the ordinary is EUR4, so it's a drop of 45%, respectively, the preference EPS is a cent more EUR4.01 also dropped by 45%. [indiscernible] sales revenue was impacted by roughly a little bit over 1% for acquisitions. And without the Corona-related business last year, keep in mind that this year, we are not tracking this anymore because it's really marginal, the sales decline would have been slightly above 10%.If we look as always and put this whole thing into perspective, we see here that on the sales revenue side the decline, but more important, as Joachim pointed it out, the -- let's say, the bottom out of the order intake Q3 was on the bioprocessing side is the strongest quarter. And therefore, we believe that this is now the bottom out of this development. Rene will later on explain more about that when he's talking about SSB respective bioprocess side.When we have a view at the regional distribution, we really can say that all regions have been influenced by the destocking. And on top of that, the regions USA and China also are, let's say, struggling a bit more with the low investment activity of our customers.What does that mean region by region? Let's start from the left on the Americas side. Here, we really have a decline of 12% to EUR973 million. Both divisions actually have the lower revenue here. Joachim mentioned on the LPS side, we're really seeing quite a lot softer demand, specifically it was on Biologics portfolio and the investment reluctancy on the smaller biotech customers.In EMEA, we actually have a decline of a good 15% to EUR973 million. Here, the significant driver is really on the bioprocessing side due to the higher comps. But also, let's keep in mind that the Russia business we see on the top line was approximately good three percentage points due to the fact that the business here is decreasing as expected.In Asia-Pacific, we have a more significant drop compared to the previous nine months period of 23.4% to EUR600 million. Here, we really have the impact of the weak business performance, specifically in China. When we look on the sales by region compared to year-end '22, we actually see Asia-Pacific drop by two percentage points to 24%. In each of the other regions, EMEA and Americas gained one percentage point to 38%.On the Bioprocess Solutions, Joachim mentioned the upfront. It's really the slow recovery in the ongoing destocking and the relatively low production levels of our customers that lead to a poorer or weaker performance.Let's start in the middle. Sales revenues decreased in constant currencies by almost 18% to EUR1.9 billion, approximately two percentage points were contributed acquisitions. And the Russia effect is also actually counteracting that by also close to two percentage points. Excluding the COVID business that is included in the comparable of previous year, the decline would have been slightly more than 10%.The order intake overall decreased by almost 29% to EUR1.7 billion. Nevertheless, the order intake is up quarter-over-quarter. I just mentioned it, Q3 was the strongest quarter on the bioprocessing order intake, but still impacted by the destocking, lower production levels and a muted investment activity.And we see really there's a demand recovery, but a little bit slower than expected. What does that mean? For the profitability of the division, the underlying EBITDA also decreased by almost 33% to EUR592 million. This corresponds to an EBITDA margin of 29.7% and here clearly a loss of six percentage points.As we mentioned in earlier calls, the economies of scale, of course, work in both ways due to the drop in volume and also due to an unfavorable product mix where we see a bit more instruments and systems. These are the two contributing factors to the lower margin.If you look at the Lab Products & Service division, we see here sales revenue declining by a good 11% to EUR553 million. Excluding COVID related business, the decline would have been around 9%.Order intake is really impacted overall by weak end markets and low investments by early-stage biotech companies. And here from the regional perspective, we have to point out China and USA. So that led to a decrease in order intake by 24% to EUR493 million. Nevertheless, the underlying EBITDA could actually be held on a satisfaction level. The margin is almost only one percentage point lower at 25.6% and amounts to EUR141 million.If you look at some key financial indicators, we, of course, see here a high investing cash flow driven by the acquisition of Polyplus. Total investing cash flow amounted to almost EUR2.7 billion, and of course, the substantial CapEx program that we are running and that we highlighted also in the previous quarters.Nevertheless, let's also have a look. Despite a quite significant drop in the underlying EBITDA of around 30% to EUR733 million, we actually have an increase in the operating cash flow of 20% to EUR543 million. That is really due to the fact that we really now have a strong focus on internal cash generation.Keep in mind, nine months '22 were heavily affected by an increase in working capital of over EUR300 million. Nine months 2023, we actually see here a positive effect out of working capital. And we believe there's also further room for improvement to generate further cash out of the -- not only stringent cost management going forward, but also further optimization of the working capital.The extraordinary items are driven by the acquisition amounted to EUR96 million. And of course, with the integrations, the structure measures and further corporate projects. The financial results, keep in mind here that, of course, we have now a substantial higher interest expense since we issued the bond. But nevertheless, here, we also see the fluctuation of the beer separations earn out liability as we did in the previous quarter.If we look at the balance sheet, of course, here, we see the drop as expected in the equity ratio from 38% to 27.6% is clearly due to the increase of the balancing some driven by the acquisition of Polyplus. Net debt, of course, as expected, is a little bit higher than EUR5 billion.And net debt underlying EBITDA amounts to 4.5%, of course, a high leverage. We anticipate it to be lower, but due to the weaker performance this one will also still go a bit higher, but we have a clear intention by generating operating cash flow. And you see that on the right-hand side, to deleverage until 2025 to stay in a solid investment grade level, which would mean a net leverage of three. And so, therefore, we do not plan any equity measures.And with this I give back to Joachim for the outlook.Yes. Thank you very much, Rainer. So we have updated our outlook for the year 2023 a week ago on October 12th. And here, you see it in a graphical presentation again. So for the Sartorius Group, we are now expecting a sales revenue decline by approximately 17%. The effects from COVID, respectively, acquisitions remain at the same size. So five percentage points, respectively, two percentage points. For Bioprocess Solutions, we are now expecting minus 18% and for the Lab Products & Services division, minus 13%.And as I said at the beginning, there is also a certain effect on the profitability that we are expecting, which is now from the bottom to the top for LPS, slightly above 25%, slightly above 29% for the Bioprocess Solutions division and for the group overall then slightly above 28%. The comments related to the COVID business are the same. We expect this to be absolutely marginal for the year 2023. The same is regarding our activities around CO2 emission intensity reduction.And when it comes to the CapEx ratio, we now expect a one slightly above 17%, which is only or exclusively attributed to the lower sales expectation now. We, of course, are managing our CapEx carefully also going forward along the lines what Reiner already said regarding internal cash generation. Of course, we are adjusting our CapEx to the later-than-expected normalization. And therefore, again, this is only related to the sales development.Net debt to underlying EBITDA, Rainer said it already. We expect this number to peak around the end of this year, and we expect the number slightly above 5%, and we will focus very much on a significant deleveraging of our balance sheet through internal cash generation.So -- and then my last chart before I hand over to Rene, is about an extension of our CO2-related set of targets. We commit to extending our target set by -- targets that will be -- at least this is what we expect, approved by the science-based targets initiative.That includes, of course, activities that we already have started regarding decarbonization together with suppliers and also customers. And one important factor, of course, is the energy side of our own activities. Here, we are shifting towards renewable energy sources regarding electricity.We have already achieved quite a bit. In Germany, the large consumers are already using hydropower generated electricity, and we are going further into that direction. Overall, we aim to be climate neutral by the year 2045.And with that, I would like to hand over to Rene for Sartorius Stedim Biotech.Thank you, Joachim. Hello, everybody. I will walk you through the Q3 results of Sartorius Stedim Biotech with similar dynamics as for the group described by Rainer particularly, Bioprocess Solutions division.After the extraordinary strong 2022, sales revenues declined by 19% in constant currencies to EUR2.069 billion in Q3. The decline excluding COVID revenues, which were only marginal this year was slightly below 13% then at constant currencies.Acquisitions contributed two percentage points to the revenues. The order intake decreased by 31% to EUR1.76 billion with book-to-bill ratio going up now from 0.8% after Q2 to 0.85% now after the first -- after the months. The Bioprocess division, Rainer talked about that. It translates there to a book-to-bill of 0.94% in the third quarter and slightly above one in the month of September.Yes, we have seen some recovery in orders in Q3, particularly in September, but softer than we have anticipated. We see clients continue to reduce inventories. However, at slow pace than initially assumed, partly due to lower production levels. We expect the situation to slightly improve in the final quarter.Moving forward, we continue to see a general reluctance in investing on part of our customers due to overcapacities that happens. We see that particularly in North America and China with less larger equipment projects compared to previous years.The underlying EBITDA decreased to EUR594 million, mainly due to volume. The product mix, however, also contributed shifting more to the equipment in sales which contributed to the EBITDA margin decrease than being at now 28.7% after the nine months. Price effects on the procurement and the customer side largely offset each other.The number of employees worldwide stood at slightly below 11,000, which is a reduction by more than 1,000 headcounts. We did mostly in operations where we have adjusted the capacities to the lower demand. Underlying earnings per share were at EUR3.47 compared to EUR6.58 previous year.Now putting the numbers into perspective for the Sartorius Stedim Biotech, we see quite a strong sales increase over four years, almost doubled. And you see on the curve, the order intake normalization now flattening with slight increase in Q3 compared to Q2.On the next chart, the normalization on demand, which we have seen going on since the mid of '22, continued across all regions in the third quarter. In the middle, EMEA, below prior year, as Rainer pointed out due to very high comps and also due to largely discontinued business in Russia weighing on top line with around four percentage points.Americas impacted by destocking and lower investments, Asia, mostly impacted by China, where we see continued low activities and expect that also the recovery here will take longer than compared to other region.Moving to the next chart, relevant profit totaled to EUR320 million compared to EUR607 million in the previous year period. Investing cash flow mainly reflects the acquisition of Polyplus as Rainer mentioned that. And ongoing substantial CapEx program, the ratio of CapEx to sales revenue was 17.9% higher due -- mainly due to lower sales level.Now shifting to our focus to the internal cash generation, we are shifting also the CapEx timing in some of -- for some of our programs accordingly due to delayed demand operating cash flow slightly above previous year, three percentage points around pushing now the inventory levels now down after buildup during the pandemic to secure the product supply.Looking at the financial indicators following the financing of Polyplus acquisition, the equity ratio stood in line with expectations and 33%. Net debt stood at EUR3.695 million, resulting in a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA of 4.0.Moving now to the updated outlook. We now forecast a sales revenue decline of around 19%, excluding COVID-related business, a decline of around 14%. Acquisitions are expected to contribute around two percentage points to the sales revenue development due to lower expectations and expectations on sales and product mix effects, underlying EBITDA margin is then expected to be slightly above 28% now for the full year 2023. The CapEx ratio is projected then around 18% for the full year '23 and the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA at around 4.5% for Sartorius Stedim Biotech.And with that I think we can move to Q&A.Yes, exactly. We can move to Q&A. Let me just add one remark. I mean, today, our call is, I think, three hours earlier than usually and thank you for everyone who made it that you were able to adapt to this slight change in timing. I would like, before we start with the questions, inform you that we have a hard stop a few minutes before 2:00 P.M. CET because we then have to jump into another call that has been scheduled. So therefore but I think we should have sufficient time that means we have one hour now. Thank you.Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Odysseas Manesiotis from Berenberg. Please go ahead.Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two and a quick one, please. So first of all, taking into account your previous expectation of consumption exceeding this year's sales by EUR500 million as your customers are working on the inventories, do you still expect the return to underlying order trends to support the higher-than-usual growth here in either '24 and '25? How do you expect this to shape up? Secondly, given your recently tempered expectations against your still high leverage and unchanged three times net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2025, would you consider any methods such as raising equity to accelerate de-levering or do you still believe this is fully achievable using organic cash flow generation? And the last quick one. From the M&A contribution to orders in Q3 implied by Rainer, is it fair to assume that Polyplus orders in Q3 were around EUR15 million in terms of contribution to the BPS order intake? Thank you.Yes. Maybe let me take the first two. So we indeed would confirm the view that the consumption of our products by our customers is significantly higher during 2023 and our sales revenue shows. And we think, overall, the number around EUR500 million is a reasonable assumption here. The question -- and then you said, okay, that should translate into an over-proportional growth, yes. The point is here in how far this will materialize within the fiscal year of 2024, and that depends very much on when exactly this effect then fully kicks in. So -- and I think you're closely following also statements by peers and customers in that regard. So that's a bit the question. But, yes, overall, we will see very significant growth from that. Again, in how far that exactly hits the two next fiscal years you were asking for that we will see. And of course as soon as we have more insights here, we will share that with you. I would like to confirm also what we expressed before when we were presenting and Rainer presented very much on cash flow related numbers as well as financial KPIs and net debt to EBITDA. First of all, we do not plan any equity measures at this time. And maybe on the Polyplus development, Rene.Yes. So when we look at the order intake increase in Q3 compared to Q2 roughly -- for Bioprocess Solutions division that was roughly 15%. I would say there are like three drivers for that increase. One is now returning orders for materials to refill the inventories. The other effect would be new business wins of new projects; and third, of course, Polyplus contribution as well. And I would say roughly those three drivers contributed on a similar level to that increase.Thank you for the clear answers and Rainer best wishes in your new role. It was great having you around.Thank you.And the next question comes from Vineet from Agrawal. Please go ahead.Hi. Vineet from Citi. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe first on the business mix within BPS. I think your equipment share at about 25% is a little higher than most of your peers. Do you think that means recovery is a little bit slower for you in '24, given consumables probably expected to recover faster? And does that have any sort of implications in terms of margins? And then just staying on margins, can you give us some sense as to how we should think about 2024? Look, I know you're not going to guide on '24, but if you could give some sort of metric that X percent organic growth, which is mostly volume-driven can drive about Y percent improvement in margins, I think that would be really very useful.Yes. So the audio was not that good. So I understood your first question. It's about kind of over-proportional growth of Sartorius during the -- in the equipment business. So the dynamics we see and that also, of course, impacts the profitability profile and the dynamics here. We compared to previous year, this year, see a quite lower investments of customers in equipment that is reflected in lower order intake than for the equipment this year. On the sales side, it's the opposite for the higher orders. We have seen in 2022 now being realized in '23, shifting the ratio of equipment within the portfolio and then impacting negatively the profitability. What we would expect then for next year to give you an idea about the dynamics, how we see that with increasing orders then for consumables and then going from a rather weak year of order intake equipment into then '24. This ratio should get back to normal, meaning that we will see a positive profitability impact here.Yes. And on the second question, exactly as I said, it's not the point in time at which we can give a solid guidance for 2024. But maybe more qualitatively, the mechanism or the mechanics within our P&L, we consider to be fully intact. So top line growth translates in a quite significant way into additional profitability and the way how one could look at it is, just as you have seen during 2023 where we had to deal with a quite significant decline in sales revenue with an effect on the profitability, I would expect an effect of a similar magnitude and similar ratios in the case of the expected top line increase again. So maybe that gives you a little bit of feeling for how the mechanisms are. And please bear with us that at this point, we really cannot be more precise than that.Thank you.And the next question comes from Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Three, please. First question, just on the book-to-bill, obviously, in Q3 it went up nicely into the 0.9 range. How should we think about that in Q4? Should we expect a book-to-bill improvement so that you can get above one in the quarter? Second question, just on the remaining order backlog. I think at the beginning of the year, there was a 500 million backlog. And I think maybe there was 150 million to 100 million left going into the second half. So after Q3, is all the backlog gone so that we are sort of fully normalized? And then just in terms of timing of destocking, I think we'd be just interested in more color around that, just around whether it's Q4 destocking done, Q1, early Q1 or indeed slipping into Q2, that would be very helpful as well. Thank you very much.Thank you for the questions. Maybe, again, we share a little bit the answering this. Maybe in general, first of all, I would like to differentiate a little bit between the two divisions here because coming back to, I think, our comments before, we have seen a challenging third quarter for the Life Science Research segment, which had an effect on our LPS business, where the book-to-bill ratio was relatively low in Q3 indeed. Whereas in BPS, we have seen a positive trend. And that, of course, was then also dominating the group's numbers as BPS is the larger division. And more specifically, we also have seen a book-to-bill ratio slightly above one in the month of September. Now you know that we always emphasize and I would like to underline that here again that it's not advisable in the business we are in to focus too much on short-term trends. And that, of course, particularly is the case when I'm talking about single months. Please just take this as an additional insight for why we are saying that we see quality the right trends and the expected trends. But again, yet not to an extent and with the momentum that we initially were expecting. So now, what does it mean for the book-to-bill ratio in Q4? We would say for LPS, probably another rather challenging quarter, whereas for BPS, and I think Rene expressed that, we do expect rather a further improvement yet on a, again, lower than initially. And initially means like during the first half of this year expected level. So that's on book-to-bill. And then, of course, this all again fits and is related to each other backlog. The way how I maybe would slightly phrase this differently is that we indeed had an excessive or unusually high order book that we carried also into 2023. And you are right, this excessive order book and while the order book has been substantially been reduced and the number has been going down a little bit further, now the question that you're asking is, is it all gone? And here, we would say maybe not all because then logically, we would say, well, back to normal in Q4. So there are probably still some pockets of excessive inventories at some customers left. And here the point is, and I think we have discussed this before, it also depends a little bit on whether some customers and some of those also have been making respective statements just recently, who have been involved in the manufacturing of Corona vaccines, now may have some inventories that were initially being dedicated to the manufacturing of Corona vaccines in some cases, like, let's say, standard sterile filters, for instance, can  use them for other purposes. So therefore, the question of what is excessive stock at a customer is not a black and white number. So I hope I'm not overwhelming here anybody by details. We just want to give insights and add color so that you really understand the mechanisms behind. So I guess what we want to bring across is we are cautious in saying, it's all gone, yes? But we definitely would say it's going down further and has been going down further. And then the timing of restocking, maybe, Rene, you already talked about that. Maybe you give some insights where you see the mechanics there.Absolutely. So looking at the destocking, there's a few parameters to watch, and we try to get a better understanding with talking to our customers. One is, of course, is the level of inventories built up during the pandemic. Second is the target inventory levels and then the consumption rate. And what we see happening and how we see this, we have prolonged or softer recovery is that some customers have built their own inventories of final products, resulting then in less or lower production levels and less consumption rate of the materials. We see from some customers to further decreasing the target inventory levels. So the reach for the materials and inventory is then longer. And what we also see is a kind of a changing ordering pattern behavior is that customers are now rather placing more of smaller orders than it used to be in the past.Thank you very much.The next question comes from James Quigley from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got a couple, please. So just picking up on the last question in terms of the backlog now sort of starting to or potentially starting to decrease. Should we now be thinking that the historical relationship between orders and sales in terms of the sort of six-month lag or 6 months offset between orders recognize the sales should start to hold just start to come back? So third quarter orders this year should be informing first quarter sales next year. So is that relationship now coming back into play? And secondly, on the midterm targets, previously, you included about EUR200 million in the LPS division for M&A. How are you thinking about that going forward or generally, including an M&A portion in your guidance? And third, a quick one on balance sheet health. You mentioned you've got five times net debt to EBITDA by the end of this year, which is I think slightly ahead of expectations on the investor side. So can you talk to the speed of deleveraging and then also any sort of risks around that from an operational perspective, that may lead to either you not hitting the three target or even deleveraging faster than that? Thank you.Thank you for your questions. So maybe I start with the last one. We have shown this one graph or I've shown it for both Sartorius Stedim Biotech as well as for the Sartorius Group, how we look on it from -- and I think we reiterated that when talking about the year-end projection that we think that there will be the peak and then the target for 2025. And I think that is a good indication for the speed at which that approximately will happen. It's maybe not advisable to use this as a yardstick on a quarterly basis. But on an annual basis, I think it's a good guidance to consider that as the speed at which we will reduce the net debt ratio going forward. So I would say it's quite a significant speed at which we will do this. And on lower levels, we have done that before. Also, in other cases, a couple of years ago, we were able, after more significant M&A to reduce our debt ratio very quickly to lower levels, and we are confident to being able doing this, this time as well. So you were asking for the midterm targets and then how far they would include certain portions of M&A. I would really like to ask for some patience here until end of January where we will talk about the midterm targets. I would like to add here, maybe a few thoughts, nevertheless, again, to be also transparent. First of all, we again would like to underline that we are very -- that we think very positive about the underlying market dynamics and the growth potential that they offer. We are also very confident about our competitiveness or positioning to participate in the -- this market growth. And I think for many years, we have shown that we are able to grow faster than the market, and we believe that we should be able doing so going forward as well. My third remark would be that back in -- or I go back even a little bit more. We have defined our 2020 targets beginning of 2012. Beginning of 2019 then when we were setting our guidance for the year of 2019, we then first time communicated our 2025 targets because we consider 2020 not to be any longer a midterm time horizon. So therefore, I think what we have is these sites that we are looking into the different factors from a quantitative view at the moment. As we said, we also have to think about what's the right time horizon to give you an idea where we are heading towards when we communicate at the beginning of 2024. So please don't misunderstand. Yes, I'm not saying here we will give -- we will choose the time horizon of 2030. That might not be the right situation at the moment in the industry to choose such a long time horizon, but we think about what's the right framework for doing that. And the reason here is that as we talked about before, maybe it's more likely that not at the 1st of January, everything is back to normal, that this will be rather a little bit more granular effect as also our customers and our peers are thinking about it, and I think we share that view.And that means that the -- how growth will look like in 2024, how the dynamics then will be in 2025 and beyond, that still might be a little bit are not volatile to an extent as we have seen it now over the last three years or so, but still maybe not fully normal and for sure, not maybe necessarily very linear. So that's why I think we really would like to ask for some patience. And then, of course, includes also what might be the order of magnitude for some M&A. And then finally, that leads me to my answer for your first question. How far order intake is a good yardstick for the next one, two quarters of sales revenue? And I would say it's not -- we are not yet there again that this is the best measure and best indicated to choose. I believe that within the next couple of quarters, we will increasingly get there, but yet it's not because yet order intake is still very much influenced by historical effects, i.e., overstocking and not already fully reflecting the future business expectation by our customers. Once this has been kicked in, then I believe order intake should become, again, a reasonable indicator for the business over the next couple of quarters. I hope that helps.It has. Thank you very muchAnd the next question comes from James Vane-Tempest from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Firstly, just on leverage. You say you don't plan to raise equity at this time, but if leverage is expected to be more than five times.Can you help us understand if it's still elevated in 2025, what could possibly be a threshold if you were to revisit this? So is it north of three times or whatever it might be in terms of thinking about equity as a way to potentially strengthen the balance sheet? Secondly, you say in the release that the visibility and predictability is lower. I guess now we're mid-Q4. How much visibility do you have, say, to the end of the year? And I understand obviously, the order intake is higher in September. And if you're thinking one to two quarters, potentially delivering on some of that. And I imagine that some customers might also be looking at their working capital. So what's the risk that some of the orders potentially say, in December, would slip into January in terms of managing balance sheet end dates and how to think about that, please? And can you also give -- finally, my final question, can you give us a bit more details to what you're seeing in China and how to think about that business from here? Thanks.Hi, James, Rainer. Maybe I'll take the first question regarding the leverage. So as I outlined before, we have a clear deleveraging strategy that is based on internal cash generation. So basically, really adjusting cost base where needed, improving working capital and of course, also revisiting the CapEx program and see what we can actually optimize on the timeline. Both all these components, we believe and our explanations are there that by 2025, we should be at an investment-grade level, meaning around 3 or 3.0 in this regard. So what is the fallback plan? I want to be very clear, it's only a fallback plan. It's not any part of our really operational projections or ambitions here is as last resort, we would use probably the shares, but this is not part that is on the agenda right now. We are confident that we will be able to deleverage through our increase in our operational efficiency. I want to be very clear here. And the other ones were -- we'll go to Rene, Joachim.Yes. Maybe I'll start before Rene. Maybe talk a little bit about how we see China at the moment. So you were asking for whether some customers might be very cautious in regards to their balance sheet management, working capital management and how they might -- and how far that might have an impact on the timing of orders. Difficult to answer. It's definitely the case. And I think we said that before that we do see cash-oriented behavior at customers at a completely different level in these quarters now, of course, also following general uncertainties, following also high interest rates. So we do not anticipate at this point this to be a major effect towards the end of the year because, as I said, we are seeing this now already since a while. At this point, we don't have any indication that this will become a major effect for December then in particular. Yes, maybe some color on the China business, Rene?Yes. Absolutely, I think it applies to both divisions that China with quite low activities and low investments for both businesses. For Bioprocess Solutions, definitely overcapacities installed during the pandemic. We also see customers kind of reevaluating the pipelines of the trucks. And yes, overall, regarding the recovery in China, we would expect that it's going to take longer than in other regions, partly also due to lower consumption levels. So the overstocking inventories are -- we see them in China, but also the consumption is definitely slower than in Europe or USJust a quick clarification, if I can, just on the leverage question. When you talked about one of the options potentially revisiting CapEx to optimize on the timeline, are you essentially saying that looking at capacity expansion plans, you'd potentially to push some of those out a couple of years just to help me understand what that means?Yes, it basically means, I think we shared with you the main capacity expansion plans. Most of them are at existing sites where we are expanding our capacity plus then as a major new site that we are building up at the moment is one in Korea. And of course, for all those projects, we have certain levers in accelerating certain execution or slowing it down at certain periods in time. It's -- all those projects have some flexibility here. And of course, we are adjusting the timing of when we believe we need the respective capacity to be really available a bit, and that is what we are working on and what will be one element of what we call internal cash generation optimization.That's great. Thank you.And the next question comes from Oliver Metzger from ODDO BHF. Please go ahead.Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one is, given the recent development, which inventory level at customers do you see it being normal before the pandemic, you talked about six to nine months. So do you believe that currently with, let's say, three to four months is the new normal? And second, it would be the great to know -- great to get some insight about the destocking pattern on different client categories? So in particular pharma there is CDMOs and the last question is to ask about price discipline in your industry. So given the lower than taking destocking, so do you see some penalties that price discipline in particular for upstream deteriorate? Thank you.Yes. Maybe I take the one on the destocking dynamics for different customer groups, segments. What we can see today is that maybe the earliest recovery we see comes from large pharma and larger CDMOs followed by particularly smaller CDMOs where we see certain impact of lower demand from small biotech companies, which bring projects in preclinical development. And there we definitely see an impact, difficult to quantify that. But I think that gives a bit of a different dynamics in, yes, those smaller CDMOs is less yet contracted capacity in commercial manufacturing compared to the larger players.Yes, maybe inventory levels, if we got the question right, I would say we would consider that -- and I think Rene elaborated a little bit on that as well before that the customers have defined their target inventory levels around the level that they had defined before, maybe some, again, talking about high interest rates, et cetera, have become a little bit more ambitious here or still about to become a little bit more ambitious. Hard to say, well, that a certain whatever number of months three, four, whatever would be the target inventory level at customers, I think it really differs from customer to customer. It really differs from product segment to product segment. But in general, we would say that what we have seen is that, whereas during the pandemic and at the very early phase of the pandemic, customers increased their target inventory levels very significantly and some said that, well, maybe after the pandemic, we will reduce, but not fully back to the previous levels. I think we now have seen that they are going down to the previous levels and maybe -- and then again, it differs from customer to customer, maybe a little bit further. But again, hard to say, well, this is the number. Pricing, again, not 100% sure as the acoustics were a little bit bad here. Pricing, I would again confirm that we have balanced what we have seen on the cost of goods side and other cost factors by our respective price increases of our products. We are in, of course, very close exchange with our customers and believe that this has been very much characterized by a partnership approach with our customers and has been well accepted. And of course, at the moment, we would say this high time of the inflation is probably behind us. So we wouldn't see any major pricing initiatives for the next couple of months, maybe more back to our quarters, more back to normal, but I think we all know what's going on in the world. And if there is another shock on energy prices, et cetera, we have to see what happens. But at the moment, I think it's the pricing level also the pricing trend is rather back to where we have been before.Okay. Thank you. So therefore no price pressure, just to clarify, or no incremental price pressure? Hello? Can you hear me?Yes.Okay. Sorry about that. Obviously the line got bad. So just to clarify, you don't see any incremental price pressure arising over last month?Okay. Sorry. Sorry, yes, exactly. That's correct.Okay. Thank you very much. And the next question comes from Charles Pitman from Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi. Charles Pitman from Barclays. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe just first on China. I was wondering if you could provide any kind of further breakdown on which levels of the business you are facing kind of most competition from local private players in the area and how you -- whether you can update us on how you're thinking about potential for market share gains post pandemic? Second, just ahead of the kind of US election year next year, how are you thinking about the outlook of the kind of funding environment? Is there anything you're hoping to see or not see? And what impact would that be, if any, if the IRA is going to push back on during the election debate? And then just finally, a quick clarification. In terms of the setting of your midterm guidance, are you going to be consulting with incoming CFO, Florian Funck or is there a risk that these could be adjusted when he comes in? Thank you.Yes. So maybe China, Rene?Yes. On the local competition. So what happened is that during the pandemic time and broken supply chains, the local competitions, competitors gained quickly on market shares, where we partly preferred to as an alternative to multinational suppliers like Sartorius. We see today that stabilized very much. Even I would say there is a slight trend backwards now when the supply became much reliable, much more reliable again. The customers in China are returning to higher-quality suppliers as well. But of course, there was a certain level of local competition going on moving forward here, but it's today definitely not impacting our business in a certain way in China. That's very much what we see is the market slowdown and not are losing any market shares to local competition.Yes. Regarding your second question, I have to say, unfortunately, our crystal ball doesn't help us much here. So it's very difficult to, I think, have any -- or derive any quantitative scenarios from any possible outcomes of the US election next year. What I would say, because I fully understand your point regarding funding environment. That's clear. And there, maybe how you would see it is, it has been at a very, very high level during particularly in 2020, where it started 2021, very high, still to quite some extent, a very well-funded small biotech companies and others in 2022 after the highly available money for this space before. So we have to keep in mind the levels were very high. Now we see this correction during 2023, but we would expect that the general trend, given the fact that this segment, this industry is still very, very innovative, there are a lot of very promising projects in the pipeline. When you think of dementia, for example, when you think of certain cancer types, name it, there are so many diseases where still better therapies are in need. Again, all this within the context of a very clear and significant demographic trend. And when you then see how many new modalities are in the pipeline, how many also still maps are in the pipeline with promising features. We believe that this underlying momentum is still there, and that is maybe as important as an outcome of the US election might be. So that is how we see it that there is -- we again have to differentiate between this correction at the moment and the general underlying trend. And of course, Florian Funck, he will join in April of next year, but he will be available and involved, of course, to some extent, in the weeks and months before. So I would not expect any effect from his -- from him formally joining at the 1st of April next year.Thank you very much.And the next question comes from Sezgi from HSBC. Please go ahead.Hi. I hope you can hear me. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions from my side, please. First of all, the CapEx ratio being higher versus what was guided in previous year, the 17%. How should we justify like the outlook forward and has there been -- I mean, if my numbers point me correctly, there seems to be a higher capitalization here because the free cash flow yield I'm getting into is quite lower than what would be implied. So just basically to put it shortly, after the 17% CapEx ratio, what should be the ratio going forward? What should we assume the ratio to be going forward? And do you have an internal threshold of minimum return on investment capital on this? I'm sure you know exactly where this question is coming from looking at overcapacities, you also have been just specifying internal minimum return on investment capital ratios. And what will be your strategy going forward? And the second question also is in a similar area. I'm seeing low single-digit free cash flow yield for the first nine months, even though inventories have been lower working capital has been lower. What will be the main driver of your deleveraging given with regular maintenance CapEx, the free cash flow generation remains relatively low?Yes, sure. So thanks for those questions. So CapEx outlook going forward. Again, this is a part of our guidance that we will give in three months from now. However, I think it's reasonable to assume a significantly lower CapEx ratio than we are expecting now for the full year of 2023. And give us again a bit time before we are more precise. But yes, the ratio will be lower and quite a bit. The threshold, of course, as you would imagine, as we make always DCF calculations for all such investments, if you really ask for threshold, then it's -- that we want to see a return that is higher than our cost of capital, that's clear. But then, of course, it depends very much on the type of investment we are talking about. As you can imagine, there are a couple of investments that have very significantly higher returns on investments, very short payback times. Others are of a different nature and it's more an infrastructural investment. So it depends a bit, but the threshold that you are asking for, of course, is always the cost of capital. And on average, of course, the return is significantly higher. Deleveraging and you're asking for the main factors here. It's both. Of course, we are working on the reduction of the net debt. But of course, the EBITDA, so a higher profitability or higher profit is the main factor here as well which, again, then of course, is, to quite some extent, volume driven. But we are also and I think it has been pointed out by Rene when walking you through the bioprocessing, respectively SSB numbers that we are also working on our cost measures -- have been working on customers continue doing that, increase our productivity. So it's, let's say, all through the P&L to improve profits and the levers for the reduction of our net debt. Of course, then it's also the profit to quite some extent and a significantly higher profit than CapEx or any other investments will be next year. Working capital, we believe, also has quite some potential going forward. I would like to remind you that during the pandemic, we have been intentionally driving up our inventory levels quite a bit, which paid out in a sense that we had lower delivery times than I would say, most of our competition. And you could see this in -- or this was reflected in our business development. And as you can also read from our working capital numbers at the moment, this is not fully out of the balance sheet yet. So there is also some further potential. So quite a number of levers that we are using for running down our leverage.Thanks. So to wrap it up, you are seeing more room to improve further to working capital and more room to cut costs further on top of what Rene described in the BPS to 10,000 FDE and lower capacity by postponing?Right.Lower CapEx. Yes, okay. Thanks. Thanks very much.And the next question comes from Falko Friedrichs from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Thank you. Two questions, please. So firstly on LPS. It sounds like Q4 is another challenging quarter on the book-to-bill. When do you expect this to inflect to improve again? Can that improve meaningfully in the first half of next year or is that rather something that could happen in the second half of next year? And then secondly, on your 2023 guidance for the group, given that you're now three weeks into the fourth quarter, can you give us a feeling for how bullet proved this guidance? Is there is clearly a bit of a concern in the market that you might not get to the guidance, right? It implies a bit of improvement in BPS in Q4. How much visibility do you have there? And how much comfort can you give us at this point for your '23 guidance? Thank you.Yes. So LPS you referred to the book-to-bill ratio, which has been not satisfying during Q3. And we indeed said, well, also Q4, we don't expect to be particularly strong. We don't expect a step change at the beginning of next year. We rather would expect a gradual improvement and a stronger second half than first half. So maybe that is how I would phrase that. Typically, what we have is that both the first and the last quarter of the year are the strongest quarters. So and maybe that will look a little bit differently next year, at least with regards to the first quarter. Difficult to be a bit more precise at this point because the lab division has a significantly lower portion of longer-standing orders. So therefore, the cycle at which things develop are a little bit shorter, but that is our current thinking here. And on 2023, well, we are confident that we achieve this guidance. And it's, I mean, we gave it a week ago. So maybe you can understand that there is not much more that we can add at this point.Okay. Thank you.And the next question comes from Paul Knight from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Hi, Joachim. It's great to hear from you. And the first question is, we had a record 20 biologics last year approved in the US were almost 17 already. Are you seeing the effect of these record levels of approvals in North America? And then the second question is, when will GLP-1s be significant? Will they need to go oral for it to have enough impact on your filtration business?Yes. Thank you very much for the question. I take both of them. So first maybe on the GLP-1. We have -- it's a molecule processes, which is different to a typical biologic sale culture. However, as you pointed, there is use of filters where we participate in these manufacturing processes as well. And we'll, of course, then participate in the growth of the volumes moving forward. And on the first question, the biologic approvals, I would say, back to what Joachim said about the fundamentals of the market being intact. I think it very much shows or demonstrate these fundamentals. And of course, we will see also growth drivers coming from these new approvals.Okay. And I guess, your thoughts on bioprocess market in past has been somewhere around double-digit growth. I'm assuming that that continues to be your view long-term?Yes, would be double-digit range, yes.Okay. Thank you.And the next question comes from Oliver Reinberg from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.Thanks very much for taking my questions. Firstly, just on market shares. You obviously have gained some kind of market shares when there was shortage in the system. And you also just talked about that you have better delivery times. So can you just discuss do you see any kind of accounts where you're seeing kind of a reverse of market shares back to the original supplier? And if so, how meaningful is the current headwind from that? Secondly, two questions on product groups and Polyplus, can you just talk about the dynamics you're seeing and to what extent Polyplus is exposed to current market weakness? And also, can you give us any kind of sense in terms of how significant the decline in bioanalytics business in LPS has been?And third and last question, just on leverage. Can you just give us any kind of flavor on how to think about adjusted interest cost for next year? Is EUR 190 a reasonable assumption or should it be more? And also, can you give us an indication what is the share of variable debt now after the refinancing? Thank you.Okay. Maybe let's start with market shares and Polyplus. So good question on the market share. Thank you for that. Absolutely, we've seen gaining market share due to available capacities during pandemic. What happens after that, of course, is not everything stays and some customers go back to the primary supplier, but there's a reasonable portion of the market share we keep or kept after the normalization. And on the Polyplus dynamics on that business, what we can say is that very much intact and as expected, good progress in the US, Europe, where we see impact indeed is as for all other businesses is China.So I can talk about the interest rate basically. So when you talk about interest expense or let's put it that way, we're slightly on the overall debt. You can calculate with slightly below 4% interest rate. 85% is a fix of that. So to help you out here, if you would add 10% to your EUR 190, you'll pretty much be there where we think we're going to end up next year on the interest expense rate.Yes. And the third question would be then the last one to answer about the design of our analytics business. So the overall decline in LPS has been around 11.5% in constant currencies. We have the bioanalytics business and the lab essential business, both with quite a bit of equipment in there, particularly in bioanalytics, a lot of equipment. And then we have service business. Service business has been growing at a healthy rate. That means that the other businesses have been in decline at a little bit higher rate than the division overall. So -- and that is also what we would report for bioanalytics, so decline in 2023 so far, a little bit higher than the number for the division in total. What I think is worthwhile to mention here is that, particularly for the two largest single product segments within bioanalytics we have seen let's say, very healthy double-digit growth rates in the period before. So it also had quite high comps, I would say.Perfect. And can I just follow up when it comes to market shares, is it all done? Or do you still expect some kind of market share normalization over versus going forward?Yes, I would say this is done. I would also say that we continue gaining market share in some areas.Perfect. Thank you.And the next question comes from Le Louet from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.Yes. Hello. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone Two follow-up questions, please. One, regarding China because I just got the feeling that the floor is not yet there. And so I was wondering what sort of visibility and specifically into the LPS division you have into this APAC division? And second question, Rainer, prior you leave and thank you for everything. There is a lack of flexibility at the gross margin level in between Q2 and Q3. And so I was wondering if you can guide us through the evolution of the mix that makes the collapse so important at the gross margin level in between Q2 and Q3. So any idea or any thoughts would be very much of interest in the future.Yes. Maybe on China, in addition to what has been said already, the market environment in China has been increasingly challenging during 2023. And I think this is something that I'm sure you have heard a lot from other players in the industry, both our peers or our customers. When you read through the more recent economic reports from China, they at least report higher than initially expected growth for the entire economy. But I would say, so far, we haven't seen that in the biopharmaceutical sector or in the life science sector. All this, again, and I think we said that before, based on very high comps, there have been very high investments in China, both into research labs as well as into manufacturing sites. So that is for sure one factor. So therefore, when you say, well, maybe we haven't seen the bottom yet or at least the end of this very low demand trade in China that might be right, I think this is also something how we would see China at the moment. You said, okay, visibility. Well, visibility is as you can imagine, limited. It's difficult to make really any predictions here, particularly as you're asking for LPS, again, a relatively short business cycle. There is not much lead time. So very difficult to use any early indicators here at this point. Of course, again, also for China, the fundamentals are strong when you consider the size of the population, the fact that this is a rapidly aging population again. So there is a tremendous need and also the Chinese policy to become more independent from external supply of medicines. So all that is -- that are positive drivers. At the same time, of course, the question is in how far potentially there will be an impact from the overall economic tensions that we see and certain restrictions may play a role. So that makes it really very difficult. But as you were using APAC also when you were phrasing your question, we would strongly like to differentiate between China and the rest of APAC. So that is very important. The rest of APAC overall is doing well. It is China that is a challenge at the moment. And then maybe Rainer for the last question.Yes. So basically, we're in gross profit, fairly easy explanation as oppose to small impact from, let's say, product mix, but that's neglectable. The biggest part here between Q2 and Q3 is, keep in mind, the purchase price allocation from Polyplus that is just for Q3 since we consolidate them since the middle of July, a good EUR20 million. And on a yearly basis going forward, you will see there are basically roughly EUR 100 million in additional costs that, of course, will be reversed on the underlying EBITDA. But that's really where you see this quarter-over-quarter big drop is related to the purchase price allocation and the corresponding amortization of that.Perfect. Many thanks and good luck.Thank you.So there are no further questions at this time and I hand back to Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg for closing comments.Yes. Thank you very much. And first of all thanks to everyone for your interest in Sartorius making yourself available at this a little bit unusual time for our call. Thank you also for all the questions and the discussions around that. Also thank you for your understanding that it is really unusually difficult to give precise guidance at this time. You can imagine it's -- we are also not really happy about the fact that we had to revise our guidance twice this year. So looking forward to continuing our dialogue latest beginning of January when we will be able to also then to talk about 2024 and our midterm outlook. Thanks again all the best.Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you for joining and have a pleasant day. Goodbye.",0,2023-10-20T17:03:02.000-04:00
Imperial Petroleum Inc. (IMPP) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Imperial Petroleum Inc. () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2023 11:00 AM ETHarry Vafias - CEOIfigeneia Sakellari - Interim CFOGood morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for our Third Quarter and Nine Months 2023 Call of Imperial Petroleum. I'm Harry Vafias, the CEO of the company and with me today is Ms. Ifigeneia Sakellari, who will be discussing our financial performance.Before we commence our discussion, please look at Slide number 2. In essence, it's made clear that this presentation may contain some forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.We raise the attention of our investors to the fact that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may potentially affect our company's performance in the future. In addition, we'd like to state that during this call, we will quote monetary amounts unless explicitly stated otherwise are all denominated in US dollars.Starting on Slide 3, it’s a summary of our company's performance highlights. Since Q1 2022, we have had profitable quarters repeatedly. This is the seventh quarter we managed to maintain our profitability and we strive to continue to do so.The third quarter of 2023 added to our established strong results as in the nine months of 2023 period, our total net income came in at circa $64 million corresponding to an EPS of $3.59, which is far higher than our current share price levels. Although profitable, our Q3 results did not reflect the strong momentum of the past couple of quarters.Seasonal factors in conjunction with three scheduled drydockings that took place in this quarter hindered our revenue generation, which amounted to $29.4 million, an amount lower than expected.Idle time faced both due to technical andApart from lower revenue generation, we did incur $3 million of drydocking costs and almostOn the other hand, our results this quarter were enhanced by our hefty gain from the sale of our Aframax tanker, the Afrapearl II. This amounted to $8.2 million, along with $600,000 of related interest income accrued to-date. Imperial Petroleum continues to enjoy an admirable free cash base of $126 million, which is approximately three times higher than our market cap.In addition, as a means to give value back to our shareholders and indirectly contain dilution, we commenced a share buyback scheme under which we have bought to-date about 1.1 million shares and proceeded as well with the repurchase of 2.6 million of outstanding warrants.On Slide 4, we provide the summary of our current fleet employment. Both of our handysize bulk carriers are on a short time charters, expiring in November 2023 and January 2024, respectively. While all of our tankers are operating in the spot market, the spot market remains favorable and hence as a general trend owners prefer spot activity than committing vessels to time charters.In Q3, tanker rates were affected by seasonal factors. However, the recent crisis in the Middle East has caused the rise in day rates, particularly for the Suezmax and Aframax tankers. Looking at our dry vessels, we do witnessed a slight improvement in rates, but the market is still well below the 2022 levels.On Slide 5, we're reviewing the tanker market. The global economic activity has been affected. Russia's invasion in Ukraine, the past COVID-19 pandemic, and most recently, the crisis in the Middle East. In this environment, the IMF expects global GDP growth to fall from 3.5% in 2022 to about 3% in both 2023 and 2024.In spite of the expected economic slowdown and concerns about the deceleration of China's economy, energy demand outlook remains positive. Global oil demand surged in June 2023 and is forecasted to increase by 2.4 million barrels in 2023, followed by another 2.2 million barrels per day in 2024.In terms of oil supply, its anticipated that low inventories will exert upward pressure on oil prices. Market will be governed by a supply shortfall, the extent of which will mostly depend on non-OPEC production levels.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has had a long lasting effect on the tanker market. Tanker ton-miles have grown by 3.8% in 2023 and this growth has been supported by the sanctions imposed on Russian oil trades.In Q3 2023, we saw a softer tanker market in general than what we saw in the first two quarters of this year, both on the dirty and on the clean side. This is in line with normal seasonal trends. However, on the dirty side, we also saw voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia, combined with Russia, finally leaving up to the announced oil supplier reductions, factors have led to a further decrease of export volumes and consequently, to a downward pressure on day rates.On the clean side, the market experienced significant volume reductions, resulting from the refinery maintenance season and this combined with lower than expected restocking of storage in Europe meant lower earnings for owners compared to the average earnings during the first half of this year.The expectation going forward is a rebound of both dirty and clean market in Q4. The major shifts include product trade flows resulting from the sanctions getting the Russian petroleum exports remain in place and this is expected to support the tanker market at least in the short to medium term.The current crisis in the Middle East is adding further uncertainty to the oil market, resulting in more oil price volatility. With the conflict as it stands, we don't expect to have a major impact on tanker markets. However, should the conflict escalate further then the risk of major impact on the tanker market will multiply.The state of [Indiscernible], probably the more strategic narrow passage for oil and oil products in the world could then be at risk of a military conflict. This, again, could give a major boost to tanker day rates.On Slide 6, focusing on the product tanker market, the global product tanker order book stands at 167 vessels, 6% of the total fleet. A total of 17 vessels are scheduled for delivery within the remainder of this year. Going forward, we do anticipate a shortage of vessels as the ratio of order book to vessels over 20 years of age is 44%.Berth capacity is limited up until 2027 due to non-existent yard space and owners need to consider environmental regulations, which are due to come in force over the coming years before committing to the purchase of any new ship.I will pass now the floor to Ms. Sakellari, who will provide a summary of our financial performance.Thank you, Harry, and good morning to everyone. When looking at the nine months for 2023 period of this year, our total profit generation is impressed. In the nine months of 2023, we have generated a net income close to $63 million, an outstanding performance given that we operate a small fleet of 10 vessels.Focusing solely on the third quarter of 2023, this indeed was a softer quarter than prior periods, mostly due to seasonal factors. Our fleet operational utilization for the third quarter of the year came in at about 71% as we had about a 100 days of technical off hire due to the scheduled drydocking of three of our product tankers and commercial ideal days stemming mostly from our Suezmax tankers, the Suez Protopia. About 67% of our fleet calendar days equivalent to 565 days were dedicated to spot activity.Looking at our income statement for Q3 2023 on Slide 7 compared to Q3 2022, revenues came in at $29.4 million compared to $42.6 million due to decline in revenues resulting from the sale of Afrapearl II, increased idle time due to three scheduled drydockings, and one of our Suezmax tanker being commercially idle for one-third of the quarter.Voyage cost decreased by $5.8 million due to the decrease of our daily banker costs by $13,400 as a result of oil prices in Q3 2023. Our running costs increased by $1.2 million due to the increase in the average number of our vessels. In this quarter, we also incurred a $8.2 million gain on sale related to the sale of our Aframax tanker Afrapearl II to C3is Inc.In relation to the sale, we also incurred $600,000 of interest income accrued in connection with the remaining consideration of $38.7 million, which is receivable by July 2024.In terms of drydocking costs, this amounted to $2.7 million as three of our product tankers underwent drydocking. We have another two drydockings up to the end of 2023, but only one more scheduled drydocking for the period 2024 and 2025. Basis the above, we generated for the quarter an EBITDA of $14 million and a net profit of $12.1 million corresponding to a basic EPS of $0.56.Moving on to Slide 8, let us take a look at our balance sheet for the nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we had the free cash base of about $126 million. Indeed, our operating cash flow for the nine-month period came in at $74 million. Thus, in this brief period, we generated from our fleet operations cash almost 1.5 times on current market capitalization.In Slide 9, we present a financial snapshot placing emphasis on our solid financial position. Our cash balance is quite high in the region of $130 million. We have about $70 million of committed capital expenditure for the acquisition of two tankers with delivery within January 2024.In addition to this, we have a receivable of almost $39 million from C3is Inc., payable by July 2024. Full debt repayment has led to annual cash flow saving principal initiatives of almost $15 million. We enjoy both a healthy liquidity and financial structure.Looking at our profitability in nine months 2023, our daily time charter equivalent per vessel came in the order of $38,500. Our return on equity basis trailing last 12 months is region 27%.One of our obligations in terms of capital expenditure is as mentioned, that we have two scheduled drydockings for Q4 2023. But following this, we only have one more scheduled drydocking for the period 2024-2025. So, our vessel capital commitments will decline drastically.Concluding our presentation with Slide 10, we simply outlined once more the key factors that assist our successful performance. Imperial Petroleum has a proven track record of profit and cash flow generation, sound capital structure management, and fleet expansion, while preserving a strong cash base, which we hope that market condition will allow us to preserve.At this stage, our CEO, Mr. Harry Vafias will summarize our concluding remarks for the period examined.I'm very pleased with our performance during the nine months of this year. In this period, we managed to generate net income of $64.7 million and operating cash flow of $73.7 million, both results being well above our current market cap.I'm also pleased by our Board's strategic decision to commence a share buyback program of $10 million as this is a means to give value back to our shareholders. Under this program, we have purchased to-date about 1.1 million shares and in addition, we have repurchased 2.58 million outstanding warrants. As we aspired that these recent moves together with our strong financial results and healthy balance sheet will soon be reflected in our share price.We would like to thank you all for joining us at our conference call today and for your interest and trust in your company and we look forward to having you with us again for our fourth quarter results. Thank you.",0,2023-10-25T13:17:08.000-04:00

Ovintiv May Generate Around $3 Billion In Free Cash Flow By The End Of 2024,"Ovintiv's () 2023 transactions have added significantly to its oil production and it should now average over 200,000 barrels per day in oil and condensate production during the second half of 2023 and in 2024.With oil prices beingThis free cash flow is expected to go primarily towards a combination of share repurchases and debt reductions. I estimate Ovintiv's value at approximately $52 per share in a long-term (after 2024) $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas scenario., Ovintiv made a major $4.275 billion Permian acquisition, acquiring Midland Basin assets from various EnCap portfolio companies. The acquisition was paid for with $3.125 billion in cash andThe acquired assets included approximately 65,000 net acres, mostly located in Martin and Andrews Counties. These assets were producing approximately 75,000 BOEPD (80% oil and condensate) and also came with an estimated 1,050 net locations (including 800 net locations with a projected 35+% IRR at $55 WTI oil).Ovintiv notes that the acquisition price was approximately 2.8x next twelve months' EBITDA at low-to-mid $70s WTI oil. It also expected a 19% free cash flow yield at those prices, indicating roughly $800 million in free cash flow over the next twelve months after closing.Production from the acquired assets may start declining in 2024 though as Ovintiv reduces the number of active rigs on the acreage from seven (before the acquisition) to two (by the end of 2023).Ovintiv also sold off its Bakken assets for $825 million in cash. These assets produced around 37,000 BOEPD (60% oil and condensate) in Q1 2023. While this is a relatively low price of approximately $22,000 per flowing BOE, the decline rate was probably fairly high due to a significant amount of new production coming online. Ovintiv's Bakken production was 32,000 BOEPD in Q4 2022 and under 30,000 BOEPD earlier in 2022. approximately 547,000 BOEPD in production during the second half of 2023, including approximately 210,000 barrels per day in oil and condensate production.At current 2H 2023 strip (including approximately $85 WTI oil and $2.75 NYMEX gas), Ovintiv is projected to generate $4.307 billion in revenues inclusive of hedges. Ovintiv's 2H 2023 hedges are estimated to have $30 million in positive value, with its oil hedges having negative value, but its natural gas hedges having a greater amount of positive value.Ovintiv is now projected to generate $832 million in 2H 2023 free cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Ovintiv's free cash flow is expected to be significantly higher in the second half of the year (compared to the first half) due to its Permian acquisition and improved commodity prices.Ovintiv's quarterly dividend is currently $0.30 per share, resulting in $164 million in projected 2H 2023 dividends. This leaves at least $334 million for Ovintiv to put towards  and variable dividends related to its 2H 2023 results.Ovintiv expects its oil and condensate production to average over 200,000 barrels per day in 2024, with its production profile expected to stabilize around 200,000 barrels per day (for oil and condensate production) in the second half of the year. I am thus modeling Ovintiv's oil and condensate production at 205,000 barrels per day for 2024 and its total production at 530,000 BOEPD.At the current strip of $81 to $82 WTI oil and $3.35 NYMEX gas, Ovintiv would be projected to generate $8.246 billion in revenues net of hedges.Some of Ovintiv's expenditures may be reduced in 2024. It is aiming for a $2.3 billion capex budget in 2024 at the midpoint of its expectations, compared to $2.765 billion capex for 2023 at the midpoint of guidance. Ovintiv expects improved capital efficiency in 2024, while its production is expected to decline a bit from 2H 2023 levels before stabilizing in mid-2024.Also, Ovintiv expects market optimization costs to decline by $92 million in 2024 due to the May 2024 end date for its Rockies Express pipeline transportation commitment.Thus Ovintiv is projected to generate $2.201 billion in free cash flow in 2024 at current strip prices, assuming that its cash taxes are fairly similar to 2023 levels. After its current base dividend, Ovintiv would have approximately $936 million to put towards variable dividends and share repurchases and $936 million to put towards bolt-on acquisitions and debt reduction. This is based on its current framework for post-base dividend free cash flow.Ovintiv had approximately $6.1 billion in net debt at the end of Q2 2023. It could reduce this to around $4.83 billion in net debt by the end of 2023 if it puts 50% of its post-base dividend free cash flow towards debt reduction.Ovintiv could also reduce its outstanding share count to around 247 million if it puts the other 50% towards share repurchases.At long-term prices (after 2024) of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas, I estimate Ovintiv's value at approximately $52 per share. This is based on estimated 2024 production levels of 530,000 BOEPD and a 3.5x EV to EBITDAX multiple.At long-term $80 WTI oil and $3.75 gas instead, I would estimate Ovintiv's value at approximately $60 per share.Ovintiv is now projected to generate a bit over $3 billion in free cash flow during 2H 2023 and 2024 at current strip prices. It benefits from its increased oil production (due to its earlier Permian acquisition) along with oil prices that are averaging in the low-to-mid $80s for the next year and a bit.This free cash flow can partly go towards paying off the additional debt that Ovintiv took on for its acquisition, as well as reduce its share count.At my long-term prices of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas, I estimate Ovintiv's value at approximately $52 per share.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Credit card delinquencies reach prepandemic levels in July,"July's credit card delinquencies climbed to prepandemic levels, with the average delinquency rate for the eight lenders tracked by Seeking Alpha rising 14 basis points to 2.67% and exceeding the July 2019 average of 2.64%.Credit quality metrics stayed unusuallyWolfe Research analyst Bill Carcache points out that credit is worsening, ""but very gradually."" The higher-for-longer interest rate outlook should eventually weaken the labor market. Still, ""we expect the pace of degradation in consumer credit to remain gradual as long as employment conditions remain strong,"" he said.This month's batch of credit card reports came in ""as expected... no surprises,"" wrote Jefferies analyst John Hecht in his monthly credit monitor report. ""July card results were in line with normalizing expectations,"" with delinquencies and net charge-offs rising; robust loan demand; and payment rates declining, but still above prepandemic levels, he said.The average delinquency and net charge-off rates are skewed by Bread Financial's () numbers, which now exceed prepandemic levels. Excluding BFH, the average delinquency rate is 1.98%, slightly higher than 1.95% in June and marginally lower than 2.28% in July 2019. The average net charge-off rate, excluding BFH, of 2.83% ticked down from 2.85% in June and remains 41 bps below 3.24% in July 2019.Of the credit card issuers that Carcache covers, he rates American Express (), Bread Financial () and Discover Financial () at Peer Perform and Capital One Financial () and Synchrony Financial () at Underperform.Loan growth increased ~1.4% M/M to $472.47B for the group and 14.5% Y/Y. Note that the issuers tracked by Seeking Alpha represent ~46% of the  held by U.S. consumers, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",47,2023-08-17T15:58:32.000-04:00

Valeura Energy: An Explosive Option On Oil As Its Journey Unfolds,"In this post, I will review the progress made by Valeura Energy () following its two strategic acquisitions of mature oil-producing assets offshore Thailand from KrisEnergy (which was in bankruptcy) and Mubadala Energy (UAE sovereign wealth fund). The recent Mubadala acquisitionWhen compared to commodity derivatives, I believe Valeura Energy is an explosive call option on oil with a current cash build potential equaling twice the market cap by end of 2024.Valeura EnergyThough the assets' costs are on the high opex/capex side with a year's FCF worth of decommissioning liabilities, Valeura Energy is now priced as if the deal (esp. Mubadala) was ""too good to be true"", and something is wrong with these assets. However, 2023 was the year both these assets started producing, and the developments in the interim provide confidence management has done a great deal and is delivering on its plans. Valeura's net cash will soon cover its market cap, and the annualized FCF is almost 100% at today's Brent price. If management were to deliver on its multi-year plan, I believe the share price is 3-5 times undervalued.The following is a snapshot of Valeura's producing fields.Thanks to the Thai acquisitions, Valeura is now a 22 kboepd producer with more than half a billion dollars in revenue, and there has been a 400% increase in share price since 2022. Valeura paid just $20 M cash for this result. Skeptics can opine on the high opex or decommissioning liabilities, or the low - at least official - reserve life on the surface (more on all this later), but it is undeniable Valeura is now a very large call option on oil as it has acquired cash flowing assets at just <4% of revenues.The combination of these two acquisitions is interesting because KrisEnergy has $275M of non-capital tax losses left, and Valeura has originally guided for an effort to restructure the company so these tax losses can be combined with other Thai III regime fields from the Mubadala acquisition (Nong Yao & Manora). By my estimates, this would accelerate the realization of this tax shield by 3 years. The expected restructuring completion guidance has remained unchanged (Q1 2024). We will see the great value of this acceleration in the valuation section. However, combining the cash flowing Mubadala package with another Thai acquisition (which did not look that interesting at the time) is a master stroke by management in my view.A key to the base or bull case for Valeura is the general field characteristics: Gulf of Thailand geology allows for easy stacking of multiple reservoir targets from a single well.This is the track record of the Mubadala fields: production has remained almost flat (1-2% decline rates) though looking at the official 2P reserves would have suggested only about 2 years of life left. This data is from the regulator (dmf.go.th) and I cross-checked this history using the footnote link. The maintenance capex was a modest $80 M p.a. to keep the production almost flat in a flat oil pricing environment!The fact there is stacked reservoir potential means it is interesting to have a sense of the coefficient of success. The black-and-white constraints for barrels to be included in 2P reserves do not capture the business reality of drilling in the Gulf of Thailand with unusually high chances of success. Historically, both from Mubadala's many years of track record, and looking at YTD drilling failures/successes of Valeura, the success rate is unusually high here, around 80%. On the contrary, based on my reading of SEC reserve regulations, I believe there are similar international hard constraints for reserve auditors to exclude any oil reservoirs without concrete and forthcoming plans to develop and exploit. These unusual statistics, in contrast with general reserve constraints, define the larger upside opportunity.This is what the Mubadala acquisition  by Valeura had to say about the reserves (emphasis is mine):To have a sense of each field's importance for the intrinsic value, I made the following table, which also includes the recent success rates on the drilling (in line with historical averages).Image: Author's compilation of company documents and earning call transcriptsCEO Sean Guest, a geologist by training, boasts an impressive career with major O&G companies, predominantly focused on gas. My review of every call since 2020 reveals that Guest has consistently delivered on the commitments he outlined. This applies to both the targeted acquisitions and the guidance provided post-acquisitions.Guest displayed his confidence in the company through significant stock purchases in the winter after the Mubadala acquisition and early summer when Valeura's share price dropped below 2 CAD per share. His acquisitions amounted to 200,000 shares, equivalent to nearly half a million Canadian dollars. Guest currently holds a stake of 0.6% in the company, totaling 1.1 million CAD.The external dealmaker for Valeura's acquisitions got 12% equity of the Mubadala producing assets in return via an SPV, though that interest has now been converted to 9.4% new VLE equity. Admittedly, this was done with short lock-ups (<1Y), but the dealmaker has become Valeura's CFO. This conversion implies some value for the Wassana field, and the Turkish gas assets. We will value the legacy Turkey exploration upside at zero. As a result of the above, key insider ownership is now a respectable 10%.Considering the currently attractive valuation of Valeura, an exhaustive background check is beyond the scope of this analysis.In the next section, I will value Valeura's flowing assets as if the acquisitions path stops here. However, there is great M&A optionality as management has proven to:The most important assumptions in my base case model:The yellow cells highlight key choices the author made. The red cells signify cells with significant discussion below. The green row signifies the DCF used in the next table. Everything below is discussed below as well. The FYI rows use some numbers from the next NAV table as well.From the DCF (in green) follows the SOTP:Brent pricing: management has guided for realizations at Brent, even though H1 saw >+$1/boe premiums. I simply model realizations at the Brent curve, and fixed at 2027 curve price onwards. Note the model builds cash in 2023 from Q2 to Q4, and uses average realized/curve Brent pricing accordingly.Regarding production, we do not model fields separately, even though the smaller production of Manora will deviate significantly from the rest and we will model this mindfully. Thanks to the heavy capex investments in 2023, we can see that Valeura production remains cash flowing until the license expiry year I modeled in 2034. I think this production profile is actually management's value creating intention, as it postpones non-interest bearing liabilities as an additional benefit. The license expiries are 2035 for Wassana and Nong Yao, 2032 for Jasmine, and 2033 for Manora. Because Nong Yao will move the needle most in the 2030s as a younger field, the modeled general decommissioning year I used is '34.In terms of opex, I used management's latest guidance, and imposed the 70% fixed/30% variable split out they communicated in a 2023 earning call to model the out years. As production declines, opex on a per barrel increases because of the fixed component. Interesting to note is that this model conservatively assumes no beneficial mix shift. In reality there will be a mix shift with production growth to the younger field Nong Yao, which has much better opex economics (opex per barrel of low teens). I think this counterbalances the downward asymmetry in mature offshore oil fields of having downtime from various small issues. For example, if opex is modeled $8 too high in the model, it means we allow for an extra 10% production downtime contingencies (10 per barrel divided by $80 brent revenue loss per barrel).For capex, there is a maintenance and growth capex component. Consistent with the 2023 cash build model excludes Mubadala capex pre-closing (which is included in management's 2023 capex guidance). As mentioned on a call, some growth capex for Nong Yao spills out to 2024.Note both opex and capex guidance for 2023 were lowered by about 15% last earnings call.Tax assets and decommissioningFor readers to have a sense of the value sensitivity of accelerating the realization of KrisEnergy tax losses on Wassana, I break out the value between 'no restructuring' and the incremental value of restructuring (time value of money). If the restructuring happens as guided at the start of 2024. My assumption is 6 months of Wassana production in 2023. Looking at the netback of Thai III fields (Nong Yao will grow considerably) in 2024, I calculate the vast majority of the NOL's can be realized in 2024 in this scenario.Lastly, there's $214 M in undiscounted decommissioning liabilities. This includes Manora costs, the field with little economic life left. As a result of Thai regulations for fields close to end life, 75% of the expected decommissioning costs for Manora have already been pledged via banks and Valeura's reported restricted cash. As my cash build starts with the Mubadala net working capital cash including restricted cash, I expense this liability in L9M '23.Regarding taxes, there's royalties, corporation tax for O&G companies (PITA), and (a stable framework of) windfall taxes (SRB) on 'good'/shallow fields.The total decommissioning costs cover around 2 years of pre-tax cash flows in the weaker outer years. Regarding the timing of decommissioning cash outlays, the regulator looks at how much remaining economics a field can sustain based on reserves. Generally, management mentioned that as long as Valeura can sustain its current remaining reserve life no deposit is required (or bank guarantee with restricted cash). Because some pledge or cash out event will happen sooner than the actual decommissioning expense (in my base case in 2034), I model this risk as cash outs happening earlier (in 2029 and 2033).Decommissioning expenses are deductible, but assuming Valeura buys no more Thai fields, there is no possibility to get tax back in 2035 from earlier periods (tax carry back in technical terms). For this reason, I expense a part of decommissioning costs without tax deduction in the 2035 year, as the youngest field will bear some expenses after the last production taxes were due.Lastly, a foreign corporation pays 15% withholding tax (judging from PWC tax advice documents, it looks like there are no exceptions) to get money from its Thai subsidiary. This jives with Thailand being quite nationalistic. I assume all cash above Mubadala's original net working capital is taxed at this rate to get to Valeura's shareholders.Modelling reveals that management's ambitious growth plans with the Nong Yao C extension make a lot of sense: it's a Thai III fiscal regime field just like Wassana, netbacks on this field are the highest. The tax asset value can therefore be realized very quickly if the tax restructuring is successful. This project will carry key value to the share price.In my opinion, given the strong track record of the fields (and ongoing drilling success rates in line with historicals), the 2P reserves are pessimistic. The current calculated economic limit for the fields is 2027 for Wassana and Jasmine, 2028 for Nong Yao, and 2025 for Manora.For the purpose of modelling a bear case, we use the 2P reserves calculations. These include all taxes and the costs of decommissioning.The 2022 reserves valuation used stale Brent pricing: (only) a few dollars per bbl higher across the curve) and a discount rate of only 10%. However, as you will be able to see in my FYI section of my model in ""base case"", most cumulative intrinsic value for Valeura builds in the first years, so sensitivity for discount rate is low.In this scenario, I estimate the tax restructuring becomes more important: if the tax losses aren't unlocked, the tax asset NPV is only around $35M (as Wassana would be decommissioned before using up the ring fenced $275 M tax losses). In the bear case, the tax consolidation is worth 0.5 CAD per share.The market price - though up almost 4 times since the two deal announcements in 2022 - has lagged the new reality of large free cash flowing assets in my view. Since the last Mubadala deal has closed, management has started an ambitious growth capex campaign which to date has been very successful (>80% successful drilling success) and confirms the asset's similar historical profile of drilling success after success. Even on this intensive growth campaign from 21 kboepd to 25 kboepd next year, Valeura Energy's market cap will be covered by net cash, $200 M (!), by the end of the year. While the long-term share price has behaved like a micro cap in the past, I would think that a company with a $200 M cash balance (and similar prospective FCF) will be out of the microcap league. Management has, for now, done what it consistently said it would do, since embarking on the lower risk strategy of buying late life oil assets on the cheap in 2020. Beautifully, the $10M KrisEnergy acquisition seemed smaller to investors but had large tax assets ($275M in non-capital tax losses), which management is now trying to combine for tax purposes with the mammoth cash flowing fields (about 20 kboepd) of Mubadala. Tellingly, management has mentioned they got advice on the restructuring of losses  the Mubadala acquisition happened. If this happens (which I believe is likely, the timing is just a bit uncertain), the prospective one-off FCF yield on the market cap in 2024 (already fully covered in cash in January) will be 106%.My base case NPV15 valuation reveals a value of 7.6 CAD per share (3 times money multiple) while the bear case based on the reserves auditor reveals a value around 5 CAD per share (+-0.5 CAD per share depending on whether the tax losses will be consolidated or not).Both the assets' performance under previous owner Mubadala on the one hand, and Valeura realized drilling success rates in Q2 2023 on the other, suggest my base case is the default outcome: the high rates of success drilling for new stacked reservoirs in the Gulf of Thailand basin has in this case been above 80%. On the contrary, based on my reading of SEC reserve regulations, I believe there are similar international hard constraints for reserve auditors to exclude any oil reservoirs without concrete and forthcoming plans to develop and exploit. These ""usual stats"" versus ""black-and-white reserve constraints"" define the bigger upside opportunity.Because value builds up quickly in the beginning years (to be frank, market cap will be covered by cash before year end), my 7.6 CAD per share valuation is quite insensitive to discount rates. You can see the gradual buildup of NPV value in my model below the green line titled ""cum NAV"" (this includes the DCF build and all items shared in the SOTP table). A 40% discount rate still suggests a 2.3 times money multiple.To account for the risk of negative operational leverage from unexpected production issues, I believe I have used a buffer on opex (I ignored the beneficial cost mix shift towards Nong Yao), capex ($20M p.a. contingency on maintenance capex), and a slightly higher decline rate than historical despite those higher maintenance capex plans.In my base case scenario, it is difficult to kill the case for a high money multiple.The main sources of upside left are:Mature offshore assets have asymmetric operational risk to the downside. To a certain extent this is captured in the production, opex and capex guidance, but tail risks such as unacceptable production issues will make the decommissioning liabilities come due sooner.Top management has a decent, yet short, track-record managing mature assets. They are reasonably aligned at 10% insider ownership. Mitigant: all key personnel managing Thai operations migrated over to Valeura.High operational leverage:Oil price risk: the interplay between operational leverage, decommissioning liabilities and oil prices is risky and makes Valeura's equity a path-dependent call option on oil prices. Higher prices on a high cost structure mean much higher cash flows and optimal decommissioning timing later (i.e. those higher cash flows for longer), and later costs for decommissioning. In case oil price should drop to $30 in 2024, the company starts burning through its cash (around $200 M in the unlikely event of a full year), and decommissioning liabilities come due earlier. Management appears to understand this however, and has guided to hoard some cash before starting capital returns programs that shareholders have already been asking for.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Alpha Metallurgical Resources: Still Cheap And Returning 15%,"A few months ago, we wrote an article titled """", where we issued a bullish call on Alpha Metallurgical Resources () stock, talking about how the company had undergone a number of changesAt the time, the valuation was also cheap as chips, with shares trading at a mere 2.3x FCF multiple.Since then, the stock has gone on a massive 48% run, almost from the very day we published our take:We liked the potential for returns in the stock, but plainly, we didn't expect things to move so quickly.Thus, today, we're updating our thesis with all of the new developments since then, looking to answer one question: What happens next?On the off chance you're new to: At the time, AMR had shown strong top-line growth, with TTM revenue soaring to $3.94 billion, a 34% increase year-over-year. This growth had been driven by a combination of factors, including increased coal demand, resulting from improved economic activity, coupled with a limited supply response. Additionally, AMR had been able to successfully pass on higher coal prices to customers, which had further boosted its revenue.: Global steel demand was forecasted to rebound in 2023 and continue to grow in 2024, which should have supported demand for AMR's metallurgical coal. This growth was expected to be driven by a number of factors, including increased construction activity in China and other emerging markets, as well as continued growth in the automotive and manufacturing sectors.: AMR was trading at a revenue multiple of 0.69x and a free cash flow multiple of 2.3x, which was well below its historical averages. This valuation was attractive given the company's strong financial performance and favorable demand outlook.: AMR had a streamlined business model with a focus on metallurgical coal. The company had essentially zero debt and solid free cash flow margins. This strong financial position gave AMR the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders.Fast forward to today, and many of these things still hold true.AMR remains debt free, and its main mine assets shouldn't require any ongoing Capex, which means that profits should drop straight to the bottom line for shareholders. This streamlined dynamic is incredibly powerful when it comes to returning capital via share buybacks and dividends.Secondly, profits remain strong. In their most recent earnings report, AMR reported more than $262 million in free cash flow on $868 million in revenue, a tremendous 30% FCF margin:That said, there are concerns.The company reported that demand for their end product was set to continue softening due to a variety of macro conditions:In addition to that, China, one of the two largest steel producers in the world (and a massive end market for Met Coal), has had major issues lately in their economy, especially around construction and credit.Country Garden (), the country's largest real estate developer, just  defaulting on its debt, and the Yuan has seen its exchange rate fall further as Chinese exports have fallen.While the World Steel Association has noted that Chinese steel production is still growing, the overall picture for demand has worsened considerably vs. where we were in early summer, and prices continue to slide:At the same time that the outlook has worsened, the company has also gotten more expensive.When we wrote about AMR in June, the company was trading at a comfortable 2.3x FCF. Today, that number stands much closer to 4x FCF, and the Price / Sales ratio is nearing 5-year highs, around 1x:While the valuation still remains depressed by many metrics, the low hanging fruit we identified in our first article seems to have been seized on by the market. As the multiple has rightfully re-inflated, further gains will likely be slower going.Finally - when we last reviewed the stock, the price was in the middle of a range. Now, shares are overbought, with the weekly Relative Strength Index reading ~77:This doesn't immediately disqualify a new entry into the stock, but given the worsening demand backdrop and the less forgiving valuation, the best course of action, for those who still want to get into this operationally excellent materials play, might be to wait for a dip.That, or sell some puts on the stock.We still like AMR's overall setup, but given the combination of an increasing multiple and a worsening demand picture for the end product, it makes sense to begin looking at shares more cautiously.Selling put options is the perfect way to express this view.If shares drop between now and expiry, then put sellers may be forced to purchase the stock on a dip.If shares continue higher or trade sideways, then put sellers are able to lock in a more conservative profit.In this case, we like the November 17th, $210 strike call options:These options are currently trading for $5.00, which represents a potential $500 profit per contract, or a 2.44% return over the next 59 days (this annualizes to a solid 15% cash-on-cash return).Should the stock drop, then put sellers would get a better price for shares. If the stock trades above $210 by expiry, then the full $500 per contract is theirs to keep.Given the 81% chance of Max Profit by mid-November, and it seems like a solid win-win trade to us.AMR is still an operationally excellent company. The streamlined structure should allow for robust returns in the future, and both nominal profits and percentage margins remain strong.That said, the valuation has re-inflated somewhat, shares are now overbought, and the cyclical met coal market appears to be softening on global macro concerns. Taken together, it makes sense to be more cautious with this name & take advantage of the setup by selling put options.We think it's a great win-win way to play this long term winner.Cheers!Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Comstock Resources: Dealing With Significantly Negative Near-Term Free Cash Flow,"Comstock Resources () reported significantly negative free cash flow , driven by weak natural gas prices. Comstock realized $1.81 per Mcf (before hedges) for its natural gas during the quarter, and $2.25 per Mcf after hedges. This resulted in a $183 millionIf Comstock maintains its dividend, I expect it to have $203 million in cash burn during the second half of the year, including the impact of $69 million in dividend payments.For 2024, Comstock may end up at roughly breakeven cash flow after dividends at current strip of $3.50 NYMEX gas while delivering modest production growth.Based on a long-term $3.75 NYMEX natural gas price, I now estimate Comstock's value at approximately $12.50 per share. This is reduced from Comstock produced an average of 1,389 MMCFE per day in Q2 2023, down 2% compared to its 1,414 MMCFE per day in Q1 2023 production. Comstock's Q2 2023 production was also 1% below the midpoint of its guidance range for 1,375 to 1,435 MMCFE per day in Q2 2023 production.Comstock also reported $329 million in total capex for Q2 2023, which was a bit above the $313 million midpoint of its guidance for $278 million to $348 million in total capex for the quarter.Based on Comstock's guidance for 1,350 to 1,450 MMCFE per day in production for Q3 2023, it seems likely to end up at around the low-end of its (unchanged) full-year guidance for 1,425 to 1,550 MMCFE per day in average production.If Comstock hits the midpoint of its Q3 2023 guidance, it will have averaged 1,401 MMCFE per day after the first three quarters of 2023. It would then need significant sequential growth to 1,496 MMCFE per day in Q4 2023 to end up at 1,425 MMCFE per day for the full year, which is at the low end of its guidance range.On the positive side for Comstock, its D&C costs per lateral foot have stabilized after rising sharply over the last couple years. Comstock's Q2 2023 D&C costs of $1,523 per lateral foot are 4% lower than in Q1 2023, although still 15% higher than in 2022, when natural gas prices were much higher than current levels.Comstock realized $2.40 per Mcf for its natural gas before hedges during the first half of 2023, including only $1.81 per Mcf during Q2 2023. It realized $0.29 per Mcf less than NYMEX for its natural gas in Q2 2023. Natural gas accounts for 99.9% of Comstock's total production.For Q2 2023, Comstock also realized $55.5 million in hedging gains, helping bring its realized price for natural gas up to $2.25 per Mcf after hedges.The low natural gas prices resulted in a large free cash flow deficit (excluding changes in working capital) for Comstock in the quarter. Comstock reported $145 million in operating cash flow before working capital changes, compared to $329 million in capital expenditures. Thus Comstock had a $183 million free cash flow deficit from operations (by its definition) in Q2 2023.Working capital changes benefited Comstock's cash flow by $186 million during Q2 2023, while it also received $25 million in net proceeds from divestitures (less acquisitions). This prevented Comstock's net debt (not including its working capital deficit) from surging during the quarter, although its working capital deficit is quite substantial at around $480 million at the end of Q2 2023.I am modeling Comstock's 2H 2023 production at an average of 1,450 MMCFE per day. This would get it to slightly above the low end of its full-year guidance.At that production level and current 2H 2023 strip of $2.90 NYMEX gas (along with a negative $0.25 differential), Comstock is projected to generate $734 million in revenues after hedges.Comstock's capex budget (including acreage leasing) may be around $570 million over the second half of 2023. It is projected to generate negative $134 million in free cash flow over this period before working capital changes or dividends.After factoring in Comstock's current $0.125 per share quarterly dividend, it would have around $203 million in projected cash burn during the second half of 2023 before any working capital changes.For 2024, I am assuming that Comstock can generate roughly 2% production growth  in total capex. This would allow it to average around 1,450 MMCFE per day in production for the full year.At current 2024 strip of $3.50 NYMEX gas, Comstock would generate $1.742 billion in revenues after hedges if its differential is negative $0.25.Comstock has hedges covering 130 MMCF per day in 2024 natural gas production at an average price of $3.50, so those hedges have neutral value in this scenario.Comstock is thus projected to generate $134 million in free cash flow in 2024 before dividends. After factoring in dividend payments, it would end up with $5 million in cash burn.I've changed the long-term natural gas price that I use in my models to $3.75 NYMEX gas, down from $4.00 NYMEX gas earlier in the year. In a long-term $3.75 NYMEX gas environment, I'd estimated Comstock's value at approximately $12.50 per share. At long-term $4.00 NYMEX gas, I'd value Comstock at approximately $14.50 per share.Comstock's debt reduction efforts are hampered by its dividend and cash interest payments, which add up to approximately $300 million per year, or approaching $0.60 per Mcfe.Jerry Jones will likely want Comstock to maintain its dividend since he converted his preferred stock into common shares last year. It can probably maintain its dividend if natural gas is at $3.50+ next year, but lower natural gas prices may threaten the dividend.Comstock is dealing with a period of significantly negative free cash flow due to low natural gas prices. At $3.50 NYMEX in 2024, it can likely reach around breakeven free cash flow while maintaining its dividend. For 2023 though, it may end up with close to a $400 million free cash flow deficit from operations (which includes the impact of capex), before working capital changes.Comstock's financial position is strong enough to handle the negative free cash flow in 2023, but it may need to consider reducing or eliminating its dividend if natural gas prices end up averaging noticeably below $3.50 in 2024.I estimate Comstock's value at approximately $12.50 in a long-term $3.75 NYMEX scenario, and thus am neutral on it currently.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Coterra Energy: Free Cash Flow Projected To Increase To $1.7 Billion In 2024,"Coterra Energy () recently increased its full-year production guidance by 2% to 3% while keeping its capex budget unchanged. It is projected to generate $574 million in free cash flow during the second half of 2023 (and approximately $1.24 billion in freeI believe that Coterra can generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow at current strip prices for 2024. It is expected to put much of that free cash flow towards share repurchases.I currently value Coterra at approximately $30 based on long-term commodity prices of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. its full-year production guidance for 2023 to a range of 630,000 to 655,000 BOEPD. This was a 2% increase from its prior guidance. It also increased its oil production guidance to a range of 91,000 to 94,000 barrels per day, which was a 3% increase from its prior guidance.Based on that full-year guidance and Coterra's production to date, Coterra's 2H 2023 production may average around 642,500 BOEPD, including 91,100 barrels per day in oil production.At current strip prices, Coterra can generate $2.739 billion in 2H 2023 revenues, while its hedges have around $81 million in positive value.Coterra's 2H 2023 capex budget may end up around $1 billion, which would allow it to generate approximately $574 million in free cash flow during that period. That would result in Coterra generating approximately $1.24 billion in free cash flow for the full year.Coterra currently has a quarterly base dividend of $0.20 per share. This may result in another $302 million in dividend payments (with its current share count) during the second half of the year. Coterra is prioritizing share repurchases over variable dividends, so it has not declared a variable dividend during the last two quarters.It also spent $325 million in share repurchases over the last two quarters, repurchasing approximately 13.4 million shares.Coterra had $841 million in cash on hand at the end of Q2 2023, so it could easily put the remainder of its 2H 2023 free cash flow towards share repurchases. This could allow it to spend $272 million on share repurchases in 2H 2023, allowing it to repurchase 9.8 million shares at its current share price. That would also reduce its quarterly dividend payments by approximately $2 million.Coterra also has $575 million in debt maturing in 2024. This debt has a low average interest rate of 3.7%, and Coterra should be able to repay it with cash on hand.Coterra is aiming for 5+% compound annual oil production growth from 2023 to 2025 and 0% to 5% compound annual natural gas production growth during the same period. It aims to deliver this growth with a similar (or slightly lower) capex budget than its roughly $2.1 billion capex budget for 2023.This may result in Coterra being able to generate around $1.7 billion in free cash flow in 2024 at current strip prices, giving it $1.1 billion for share repurchases, variable dividends and debt reduction after paying out around $600 million in base dividends.I have updated my long-term commodity prices to $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. Based on Coterra's projected 2024 production levels and an EV to EBITDAX multiple of 5.5x, Coterra would be worth approximately $30 per share at those commodity prices.Another way to look at it would be that Coterra's free cash flow yield (post-tax) would be approximately 8.0% at a share price of $30 and those other inputs mentioned above.For comparison, Coterra's 4.375% unsecured notes due 2029 have been trading at around  and yielding 5.9% to maturity. I often value the equity based on a free cash flow yield that is a couple percentage points higher than the bond yields.Due to relative weak natural gas prices in 2023, Coterra is projected to generate approximately $1.24 billion in free cash flow, down from $3.942 billion in free cash flow in 2022.This should improve in 2024, and I currently estimate that Coterra can generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow next year at current strip. Coterra is likely to use much of this free cash flow (after its roughly $600 million in base dividend payments) on share repurchases.I estimate Coterra's value at approximately $30 per share at long-term prices of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. Coterra should be able to generate an 8% free cash flow yield (after cash income taxes) at those commodity prices.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

ESS Tech Levels Up,"Like many pandemic SPACs,  () is trading at a fraction of its $10 opening price. I day-traded it on SPAC Day, but have not owned it since, because they went public tooOver their entire existence, they have only $3.7 million in sales, all in the past 5 quarters, most of that in the last quarter. We are still at the stage of pilot projects here. The earliest we would see wide scale deployment of their batteries would be around 2030 with a ramp beginning a few years earlier.But let's zoom in on the last week of the price chart.What happened there is that Honeywell () is making a strategicThe reason is that energy storage solves the big problem with renewables.The pace of new solar, wind and battery investment in the US is staggering, driven by three thingsThing One: In the next 10 years, the US has to add capacity for another 300 terawatt-hours of annual demand in the face of accelerating retirements of 1980s-1990s vintage coal and gas assets nearing end of life, or no longer economically feasible.Thing Two: Absent subsidies, wind and solar are the cheapest forms of new generation, and the gulf widens every year. The only other thing in the same ballpark now is combined cycle gas.The levelized cost of electricity [LCOE] is a measure of the average cost to produce a megawatt-hour of power over the lifetime of a facility, including capital, operational and consumables costs. Those are the 5 types of new construction that make sense now in an unsubsidized world. Everything else is much more expensive. The dashed lines are the average marginal costs of existing nuclear (in green), coal (in black) and combined cycle gas (in red) in 2022. In most US geographies in 2022,  solar or wind unsubsidized costs were lower than the marginal cost of power at  coal and gas plants, hastening their retirements.Thing Three: There are subsidies at the Federal and state levels that drive the cost even lower. Here's the subsidized analysis, only including the newest Federal subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act [IRA]:In very limited geographies, and on projects eligible for all three major subsidies in the law, the subsidized cost of solar and wind are substantially zero. That's probably theoretical, and no one will be able to thread that needle. But even in the most expensive geographies, renewables remain a great deal in the subsidized analysis.That's what's driving everything now. The challenge of bringing down the cost of renewables is complete. The new challenges will be managing all this cheap power with cheaper and more flexible energy storage than we currently have, software, and new transmission/distribution.The big problem with renewables is intermittency. The sun only shines during the day, and sometimes it's cloudy, even in the Arizona desert. Wind blows when it blows. There are also seasonal issues. Here are the problems that need solving:In response, we see a ton of energy storage entering the interconnect queue, the first regulatory step in getting a new asset onto the grid. Two charts tell the story here.First, the surge in storage capacity entering the interconnect queue:408 gigawatts is about a third of all U.S. generating capacity, and almost half of peak demand. But there is a , a major hurdle right now, and a minority of that will get built. Most of it is co-located storage with new wind or solar, which makes the most sense.Here's what has been built so far:That's 10x as much storage in those last two years than in all previous years combined.Right now, that's almost all lithium batteries, trending towards iron-phosphate cathodes [LFP] for their safety, reliability, and longer cycle-life than cobalt-nickel chemistries. It sacrifices some of lithium's energy density, much less of a concern for a stationary installation at a solar or wind farm than in an EV or mobile device.But there are problems with lithium for this application.Lithium is not easy. It is one of the most energy dense metals, which is why it attracted attention in the first place, but it has always been difficult to harness. The current lithium-ion chemistries, a workaround to begin with, took decades to develop, and they are still trying to perfect that.But those decades of development and the maturity of the market are why we are seeing all that lithium-ion energy storage coming into the interconnect queue. These batteries are tested, validated, and available in large quantities.The primary advantage of lithium batteries, the energy density, is very important if we are talking about mobile applications from smartwatches to EVs. But in the context of a stationary installation at a solar or wind farm, this is much less of an advantage. And there are also problems.Lithium is ill-suited for most of what we will need energy storage for. It only really helps with diurnal mismatch and curtailment. Right now, those are the biggest issues with renewables, and since lithium batteries are ready to go in large quantities, that's what makes sense now. But this will change as more wind and solar hit the grid, and the use cases increase. Wind and solar were 15% of power generation in the US in 2022, up from 5% in 2012, and up from 10% 5 years ago. The more that gets added, the more that the problems outlined above will come to the fore, and lithium will be insufficient.What is needed is long duration energy storage. Whereas for mobile applications energy density is the most important metric, here we are looking for:ESS Tech's iron flow battery checks off the first six boxes, and maybe the seventh.There is a ton of private investment going into long duration energy storage, and not just batteries either. I have a spreadsheet with over 100 companies and 32 technologies or support services. There are 3 basic types:The cutoff for usefulness is 80% efficiency, which is another way of saying you lose 20% of the energy in the round trip. That's about what you get from lithium-ion.This has given new life to old battery technologies, one of these being flow batteries, where charged ions are exchanged between two large tanks of liquid electrolyte.You can see that this is wildly impractical for a phone or car. But it makes a lot more sense in the context of a stationary installation at a solar or wind farm.Like many of the battery solutions, ESS is selling a modular containerized battery, the Energy Warehouse.As you saw up top, they haven't sold many. So how do they stack up to those requirements from the last section?A lot of positives there, and very few negatives. So why do they have substantially no sales? The problem is that despite all the limitations, LFP batteries are ready today and solve today's problems. Long duration storage is at the pilot program stage, where utilities are doing small installations to test these things in real world environments. Announcements of these are starting to pick up in 2023.This stage is going to take years. An optimistic timetable is mass deployment beginning around 2030, with a ramp beginning a few years earlier.But in the energy sector, I believe this is the blue sky opportunity of the next 5-15 years. So does Honeywell.Honeywell has been hot on energy storage since about 2018, and they like to talk about it any time they are given the opportunity. They sell containerized LFP batteries - supply deal with Freyr () - along with software and services for remote management. They were talking about  their own flow battery in late 2021, but nothing has come of that, and maybe this investment replaces that effort. They have an investment in Electric Hydrogen, for hydrogen storage. They often work with Duke Energy () as their partner for testing things out.The deal:They said they will have about $120 million on the balance sheet at the end of the month and quarter, which gives them 6 quarters of runway at their most recent burn rate, or through the end of Q1 2025.Altogether, that totals $81 million including the pre-purchase deposit, but not including the 2026 performance warrants.Honeywell gets:ESS gets:ESS shareholders got:So overall, this is a great deal for a struggling company that went public too early in the SPAC craze, but good technology may win out in the end.This is a wide-ranging group of mostly private companies and also a few big names. Bill Gates'  is an investor in many of these companies; they were an early ESS investor, and also Electric Hydrogen. I want to mention 2 competing long duration batteries.This remains a very wide open space in my opinion, but I think we are going to see a sorting over the next couple of years.This is unequivocally good news for ESS, who were floundering a bit, and needed a shot in the arm. This is a nice shot.But we are still at a very early stage here. LFP batteries are ready to go and solve today's problems, diurnal mismatch and curtailment. Renewables are only 15% of generation now, but growing fast. Once that hits around 20%-25%, lithium will become insufficient, and all those problems will come into sharper focus. Let's look at curtailmentAlmost 10% of CAISO renewables generation was wasted in March-May 2023, equivalent to about 2.5 days of average systemwide demand. As more renewables come online, and in larger scale, spring curtailment will balloon, and we will want to save some for summer heat waves, or other weather events. Lithium can't do this, nor can it power through the whole night, or a cloudy, windless day.But all these pilot programs have to run their course. Buying a ""25+"" year asset is tricky business, and at 15% of generation, there is no crying need. Yet. But more and more, all the players in this world are coming to acknowledge that storage is the logical lynchpin to the whole cheap renewables buildout. It's a real blue-sky opportunity, but still not quite ripe.At  we follow the trends that are forging the future of business and society, and how investors can take advantage of those trends.

Carpenter Technology Corporation (CRS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Carpenter Technology Corporation () Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 10:00 AM ETJohn Huyette - VP of IR and Corporate DevelopmentTony Thene - President and CEOTimothy Lain - SVP and CFOElizabeth Huseynov - TD CowenJosh Sullivan - The Benchmark CompanyChris Olin - Northcoast ResearchMichael Leshock - KeyBanc Capital MarketsGood day, and welcome to the Carpenter Technology Corporation First Quarter 2024 Fiscal Year Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Huyette, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Carpenter Technology earnings conference call for the fiscal 2024 first quarter ended September 30, 2023. This call is also being broadcast over the Internet, along with presentation slides. Please note, for those of you listening by phone you may experience a time delay in slide movement. Speakers on the call today are Tony Thene, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Lain, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Statements made by management during this earnings presentation that are forward-looking statements are based on current expectations. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements can be found in Carpenter Technology's most recent SEC filings, including the company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 and the exhibits attached to that filing.Please note, that in the following discussion, unless otherwise noted, when management discuss the sales or revenue that reference excludes surcharge. When referring to operating margins that is based on adjusted operating income, excluding special items and sales excluding surcharge.I will now turn the callThank you, John. And good morning to everyone on the call today.I will begin on Slide 4 with a review of our safety performance. For the first quarter fiscal year 2024, our total case incident rate was 2.1. This rate has been elevated over the last severalNow let's turn to Slide 5, and a review of the first quarter. On our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and signaled operating income was expected to be flat or slightly up sequentially, even though we outperformed the fourth quarter expectations.At first quarter guidance represented a meaningful improvement compared to the historical trend of a sequential decline in profits, in the first quarter of a fiscal year. Building on our operating momentum, we exceeded that guidance and reported first quarter operating income of $69 million, a 10% increase sequentially.Most notably, the SAO segment exceeded expectations for the quarter, delivering $80.8 million in operating income, above the outlook we provided of $72 million to $77 million. Further, SAO realized an adjusted operating margin of 19.4%, growing from 16.8% in the previous quarter. This impressive margin expansion came as a result of targeted improvement in product mix, higher realized prices and continued focus on productivity.We continue to realize price gains on both contractual and transactional business. As evidenced at the beginning of October, we announced another price increase of 7% to 12% on our SAO transactional business.We also generated $7.4 million of cash from operations during the quarter, maintaining a healthy liquidity of $366.4 million. Finally, we are positioned at a strong demand environment across our end use markets where our material solutions are valued by our customers.Now let's take a closer look at our demand outlook on Slide 6. Carpenter Technology produces specialized highly engineered products that are essential to the functioning of critical applications across the aerospace, defense, medical and other end use markets.Our unique collection of assets and capabilities to produce these products are not easily replicated. And it required decades of experience to generate the high quality needed to meet stringent industry standards. Demand for our difficult to manufacture products is exceeding industry supply and we see tangible evidence of this.Our backlog continues to grow, setting new records every quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, our backlog was up 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. We continue to raise prices with our most recent announcement earlier this month of a 7% to 12% increase on our SAO transactional business.Lead times remain at record levels and could be even longer as we are actively managing incoming orders and customers continue to tell us their primary concern is surety of supply, asking when they can book more with us. We expect this demand environment to remain strong.In aerospace, OEMs continue to work to increase build rates, targeting levels exceeding pre-pandemic highs. Defense demand, already growing is projected to accelerate due to geopolitical events. Medical demand continues on a steady climb due to strong trends such as aging population and focus on patient outcomes. And demand for our premium products in our other markets is also projected to remain high due to ongoing energy investment needs, light duty vehicle builds and semiconductor capacity expansion.As always, there is active discussion in the general marketplace about near-term demand. For example, even most recently this week, some aerospace OEMs discussing build rate target adjustments and ongoing delivery challenges within the supply chain, or the impact of disruption to vehicle manufacturing associated with workers strikes.What we can affirm is that these issues are not affecting our general demand levels. We remain oversubscribed in terms of demand with customers generally wanting more than we can produce. We have a substantial backlog of orders with material wanted sooner, even as we work to increase output. We also see unexpected emergency demand from areas like medical and defense associated with current world events, are from aerospace associated with spares need.What you are hearing from the marketplace is an affirmation of the strong demand in the near term and the long-term. Beyond the near term, our customers also continue to partner with us on our strategic growth efforts.Medical innovations, next generation defense platforms and electrification are examples of areas where customers are partnering with us to develop their next-generation products. In this demand environment, we are well positioned to continue to drive topline growth while expanding our margins through productivity improvements, product mix optimization and higher prices.Now let's review first quarter sales performance. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, sales decreased sequentially and increased significantly year-over-year. The year-over-year performance reflects our significant productivity gains. As anticipated, volumes decreased sequentially due to fewer operating days, planned preventive maintenance activity and most importantly targeted mix management.Importantly, profitability improved in the quarter, resulting in a sequential increase in our operating income on lower sales. Notably, SAO's adjusted operating margin was 19.4% in the quarter, up from 16.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The profit margin expanded through a combination of productivity efforts, price increases and strategic mix management. This means we are actively allocating capacity to the areas where we add the most value.We serve critical applications across all of our end use markets, and apply ongoing strategic mix management and how we serve them to capitalize on the higher margin products. Our profitability has been increasing over the previous quarters and will continue to improve with higher pricing, product mix optimization and continued productivity improvements.Now, I will turn it over to Tim for the financial summary.Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone.I'll start on Slide 9, the income statement summary. Net sales in the first quarter were $651.9 million net sales excluding surcharge totaling $492.8 million. Sales excluding surcharge increased 31% from the same period a year ago on 12% higher volume. Sequentially, sales were down 12% on 18% lower volume. The year-over-year increase was driven by significant productivity gains to meet growing demand.As Tony mentioned earlier, the lower sales and volumes sequentially were primarily the result of fewer operating days and planned preventative maintenance activities, necessary to ensure our equipment continues to perform at high levels. Gross profit was $124.1 million in the current quarter compared to $54.8 million in the same quarter of last year and $119 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gross profit in the current quarter is up 126% compared to the same quarter last year and up 4% sequentially.SG&A expenses were $55.1 million in the first quarter, up about $9 million from the same period a year ago, and roughly $1 million lower sequentially. The increase in SG&A expenses versus the same quarter last year is primarily driven by headcount and higher variable compensation accruals. The SG&A line includes corporate costs, which totaled $20.9 million in the recent first quarter.As we look ahead to the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect corporate costs to be similar to the first quarter at about $21 million. Operating income was $69 million in the current quarter compared to $8.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and $62.9 million in our recent fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.The sequential improvement in operating income, up 10% was driven by our productivity efforts, actions we took to manage product mix, as well as the benefits realized from higher base prices. As a result of these actions, we continue to see profit margin improve with total company adjusted operating margin reaching 14% up from 11.2% in the previous quarter.Moving onto our effective tax rate. For the recent first quarter our effective tax rate was 16.1% which is below our expected full year effective tax rate of roughly 22% to 24%. The lower effective tax rate was driven by tax benefits recognized in the current quarter related to certain share-based compensation awards. Note, that tax benefits were worth approximately $0.07 per share relative to the guidance we provided.As we look ahead to the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect the effective tax rate to return to a more normalized rate of about 24%. We affect our full year effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 to be in line with the range we previously communicated of 22% to 24%. Earnings per share for the current quarter was $0.88 per share. The results demonstrate our continued momentum supported by improving profitability and a strong demand environment.Now turning to Slide 10 and our SAO segment results. Net sales for the first quarter were $570.1 million, were $417.3 million excluding surcharge. Compared to the same period last year net sales excluding surcharge increased 37% on 12% higher volumes. Sequentially, net sales excluding surcharge decreased 13% on 19% lower volumes.The year-over-year improvement in net sales was driven by higher shipment volumes due to productivity gains, the impacts of higher prices and an improving product mix across our key end use markets, as Tony reviewed on the market slide. Sequentially, lower volumes as anticipated were impacted by the planned preventative maintenance, fewer operating days and the deliberate actions to improve product mix.Moving to operating results. SAO reported operating income of $80.8 million in our recent first quarter which outpaced our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, SAO operating income improvement of $61 million is largely due to higher sales, driven by strong demand, higher prices and increased production levels.On a sequential basis, operating income improved by about $1 million. Again, our operating income results improved despite the lower volumes. This improvement was largely the result of the positive impact of targeted mix improvements, higher prices and realized production efficiencies. The improvements in productivity, product mix and pricing are evident in the adjusted operating margin, which has increased to 19.4% in the current period as compared with 6.5% in the same period a year ago and 16.8% sequentially.Looking ahead, the SAO team remains focused on executing actions to further increase production levels and production flow and to actively manage the product mix to maximize the capacity for high-value products. Based on current expectations, we anticipate SAO will generate operating income in the range of $78 million to $82 million in the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024.Now turning to Slide 11 and our PEP segment results. Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $101.8 million or $93.1 million excluding surcharge revenue. Net sales excluding surcharge increased 6% from the same quarter last year and decreased 13% sequentially.The year-over-year growth in net sales was driven by strong demand conditions, primarily in our Dynamet Titanium business. More specifically in our Dynamet Titanium business, the growth in net sales from the same quarter a year ago was driven by materials used in medical applications.In the current quarter, PEP reported operating income of $9.1 million. This compares to operating income of $6.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and operating income of $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The increase in operating income in the current quarter is primarily the result of improving profitability in our Dynamet business.Similar to SAO, Dynamet continues to focus on improving productivity to meet strong demand in the aerospace and defense and medical end use markets for our titanium products. We currently anticipate that the PEP segment will deliver operating income in the range of $9.5 million to $10.5 million for the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024.Now turning to Slide 12 and a review of adjusted free cash flow. In the current quarter, we generated $7.4 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $174.9 million in our recent fourth quarter and cash used for operating activities of $78 million in the same quarter last year.On a year-over-year basis, the cash from operations was significantly influenced by higher profitability and less pronounced inventory build as we continue to improve productivity and product flow across our operations. In the first quarter of last year, we built $121 million of inventory as compared with $68 million of inventory built in the current first quarter.In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we spent $22 million on capital expenditures. We continue to expect to spend a total of about $125 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024. With those details in mind, we reported negative adjusted free cash flow of $15 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our liquidity remains healthy and we ended the current quarter with total liquidity of $366 million including $18 million of cash and $348 million of available borrowings under our credit facility.With that, I'll turn the call back to Tony.Thanks, Tim.Now let's review the key takeaways from today's call. We realized 10% sequential growth in operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. This was a meaningful improvement compared to the historical trend of a sequential decline in profits, in the first quarter as a fiscal year. And we outperformed our previous guidance.The strong quarterly performance is indicative of the demand environment and our ongoing operating momentum. The SAO segment exceeded expectations with operating income of $80.8 million and adjusted operating margin of 19.4% in the first quarter. SAO continues to build momentum with increased productivity, higher prices and improved product mix.We are operating in a strong demand environment for our material solutions with positive near and long-term outlooks in our end use markets. This is demonstrated in our record backlogs. Long lead times and customer focus on a security of supply.Our strong first quarter financial performance combined with the second quarter guidance would result in one of the two highest first half financial results in the history of the company. Building on that first half momentum, we project second half fiscal year 2024 operating income to be 28% to 35% higher in the first half.Let's take a closer look at the second half outlook on the next slide. As evidenced by our recent performance, we've seen meaningful increases in our productivity over the last several quarters, especially in SAO. However, we still have plenty of runway, as we have yet to return to our pre-COVID operating rates in some of our key work centers. We continue to invest in training and mentoring programs for our shop-floor employees to safely drive productivity gains, while maintaining our high quality standards.But most importantly, we have certain key work centers, which have not been running at their full potential as our mix continues to shift to more difficult to manufacture products. We expect meaningful increases in productivity at these specific units in the second half of this fiscal year. This next level increase in productivity, combined with continued realization of higher pricing and improvement in product mix should drive operating margins even higher in the second half of fiscal year 2024.Now let's take a look at how this fits in with the longer-term earnings growth projections. As I've detailed in previous calls, our goal is to double fiscal year 2019 operating income by fiscal year 2027. These figures imply a 40% compounded annual growth rate on the operating income from fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027, a very strong growth target. I've also noted that this growth was not going to be back-end loaded and that we expected to make significant progress towards our goal in fiscal year 2024.As you can see with what we expect for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are setting ourselves up to take a meaningful step towards our longer-term goal. With estimated fiscal year 2024 operating income in the range of $310 million to $330 million, we expect to realize approximately 50% of the opportunity in fiscal year 2024.This level of performance, would be the highest annual profitability in the history of the company and we are working to accelerate productivity gains and capacity to push earnings even higher. This is an exciting time for Carpenter Technology. The near-term and long-term demand outlook is strong across our end use markets for our broad portfolio of specialized solutions.We have leading capabilities with a difficult to replicate system of assets and we continue to drive improved productivity to unlock additional capacity to capture demand. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue to drive growth and achieve our long-term operating income goal.Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to the operator.[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Good morning. This is Liz Huseynov on for Gotham. And I was just wondering if you can provide any detail about order trends in the quarter by aero end market for instance fasteners versus engine versus other structures?Yes. Good morning. I'll take that question. Aerospace engine sales were up 43% year-over-year, down 8% sequentially. So, even though down 8% sequentially due to the items that we noted in our prepared remarks, the quarterly shipments are about 90% of pre-pandemic engine ship rate.So, bottom line is that engine sales remain strong and were oversubscribed and the ramp pushed -- as the ramp pushes demand even higher, well beyond pre-pandemic levels. On fasteners, sales up 7.7% year-over-year and down sequentially about 13% same story there as engines. So, hopefully that's helpful.Yes, thank you. And then, is there any incremental weakness to demand in non-aero markets given the macro?Well, certainly, you've heard, you know, commentary out there in the market around the general industrial market and I can comment on that. That is a, that's a limited portion of our sales. That's used to support that general industrial activity. Those trends are not material meaningful to our bottom line as our focus is really on high value difficult to manufacture products, where demand is currently outstripping supply by quite a bit. So, as you know our portfolio consists of premium high value products and you know any type of weakness in those submarkets will not impact our bottom line materially in the short-term or the near term.Okay. Thank you. And then just one more. Can you give any color on which work centers have the most opportunity for productivity gains?Yes, it's a good question. It's a really good question. The biggest driver certainly is on the front end of our, our process, which is the primary melting areas, there's a lot more productivity and output we can get from those. So, that's the major driver, but also on the back end and finishing, if you think outside of that sale and look at Dynamet, for example, their biggest increase in productivity is on the back end, and some of the finishing pieces.And in fact, we've got a couple of pieces of equipment that will be installed here in the near-term that could see Dynamet's profitability, our operating income much like SAO, will go up as close to 50% higher quarterly in the second half versus the first half.So, there's a lot of areas that we're working on. I think the good news is, that we're able to achieve these very high levels of operating income knowing that our business is still not operating at 100%. So, from a shareholder standpoint, there's a lot more that we can do to drive profits even higher.Okay. Great. Thank you.Thank you.The next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning, Tony, John.Good morning, Josh.Congratulations on the quarter here. Just on the base price increase on the non-contract alloys. Is there a way to think of percentage your capacity that's available for that transactional business at this point? And then, in previous cycles, where aerospace was consuming more capacity, what does that mix shift look like for the non-aerospace markets? And I'm just curious to hear how those non-aerospace markets are responding in this cycle versus historical cycles?Let me see if I can tackle that question for you. Certainly, in this cycle here, aerospace and medical are the ones, driving the quickest for us and that makes up, you know, well over 75% of our revenue. Some of the other markets, for example, like energy is single digits for us in terms of percent of revenue.But again for them to get time on the mill, we're seeing prices move up significantly in the energy side where they challenge aerospace type prices and that's what it takes for us to be really interested in those types of products. So obviously, our main focus is on the aerospace and medical, Josh. And I would say if you compare, you asked to prior cycles, the amplitude of this ramp is significantly greater than in prior cycles.Got it. And then, Tony, you spent some time there, just talking about the fiscal '27 targets and the front-end loaded nature of how the guidance is put together. But as far as the back-end of those targets, you know, is there any reason we would think to plateau there or is it just conservatism on your nature?Well, we've heard that as that was, I thought, I did a question on this, Josh. And if you let me kind of go on for a little bit to kind of put all that in context and then come back to your question. I spent some time, last night, and I was thinking about what we've really said over the last couple of quarters, and as you well know, you were there, this all started in May of 2023 when we had our Investor Day, right where we said we were going to double operating income FY '19 versus FY '27, which is one of our most profitable years by the way, 40% CAGR from '23 to '27.As you mentioned, we said it wasn't going to be back-end loaded. It was going to have a meaningful cash generation and we didn't need to make any large scale capital expenditures for capacity or M&A to get there. We come out with the fourth quarter, and we actually exceed our target of getting into FY '19 run rate profitability. So, that's a big, that's a big checkmarks.During that fourth quarter so, about three months ago, we said that this first quarter was going to be slightly down to flat and it was going to, you know bust through the normal seasonality where you see the first quarter being sequentially down. And as you all know, we had a lot of people doubt us and say that you couldn't do that.Well, we actually exceeded that number. And now we come in and say that the second quarter is going to be another impressive quarter, just like Q1 even though we'll continue to do our planned maintenance even though its got two major holidays in there, we're still going to operate at that level.And then, what you're getting to the new piece of information that we came out with today. We said that even after those two quarters, put those together and we're going to do another 28% to 35% on top of that, it's, it's very impressive growth and that's why we took the time Josh to talk to you about that some of these work centers are still not running at the rates that we know they can run at. That's how we have line of sight to that second half.Again, we said, it wasn't going to be back-end loaded, but we never said that we were going to get 50% in year one or four. And I think your question is that, that's an awfully strong comment, we've heard -- now does that mean that years two, three and four could be even more and is there some conservatism put in there. You might have a point, maybe there probably, there probably is a little conservatism in there and we have the ability to even push that higher.That's right. Good. No. Thank you. Thank you for that. And just one on the productivity side of that, you think Carpenter is doing anything different on the labor side and those works centers or do you think it's just a natural factor of timing experienced that they're getting better?I don't know if we do anything differently. I mean we have to be very, I'll use the word cautious right, because we are producing products that can never fail. A very high quality standards. So, we just don't take chances, if an operator is not ready, they're not ready. And we don't push them to put them in a situation where we could sacrifice the quality of our product that's just, that's just unacceptable.I'll give you a couple of numbers that are interesting. If you think about a new employee that's been with us two years or less. And if you look at our SAO operation. Our plants range anywhere from 30% to 60% of our shop floor workers have been there two years or less. And our Dynamet facility, we have one facility that's 50% are new in the last two years. The other is almost 30%.That is a big influx of new employees highly qualified. I mean, the level of employee that we're, that we're attracting is very high, but it's a complex, very sophisticated equipment that we're going to make sure that they can operate it, number one, safely and always within the quality standards that we hold ourselves, doing that the industry requires. So, you've seen some nice improvement over the last couple of quarters. The good news is there's still, there's still more improvement to come. Hopefully that answers your question.Yes. Yes. Great, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. And thank you for the time.Thank you.[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Chris Olin with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning and congrats on the quarter, guys.Hi, Chris. Good morning.I was just wondering on the near term. Has there been any type of negative volume impact associated with the drop in the commodity nickel market? Just wondering, if some customers will delay orders. Are you seeing any of that because of the surcharges visibility or are we at a point where like the long-term behavior has kind of changed when your customers are worried about supply?I think, the ladder right and I think, I know we're not having any customers delay orders because of where the nickel prices or where they think it's going to go. I mean we have, we have all of our customers, trying to get into the order book earlier. Right? As you know we've closed the order book, a couple times. So, that comment that you just made in this type of environment does not, it's never made, it's never, it's never discussed, that's not a factor.Okay. I may have missed it, I apologize if I had, but I was just thinking about the pricing dynamics and your comments about the increases. I was just wondering if there are contract renewals on the horizon, yet? I can't recall from the last quarter.Yes, there are. I mean over the last couple of years, obviously, by our results, you can tell that we've had contracts that have renewed and now you're seeing that, that higher price come through and there are a couple more that are in the works as well. So, it seems like at any point in time, we have one or two that we're, that we're working through. And there's a couple significant ones that we're working through, as we speak.Is it safe to assume something like, you know, 20%, 30% renews price each year for the model?Let me make sure I understand your question. Are you saying that 20% or 30% of contracts renew every year?Yes. Will you renew at a higher price. So, I could put that in my--Well, all contracts renewing at a higher price, that's something that's significant, that's consistent across the industry, you can, you can take, you can take that with a high level of confidence that all contract renewals, will be at a much higher price.Okay. Just last one of the shift quickly back to at Dynamet and guess, I'm thinking a bit about the Boeing 707 and the A350 build rate increases kind of the peak outlook and I can't recall if Dynamet is levered to one platform more than the other. And you know, would you benefit kind of significantly from a doubling of the production targets? And I just lastly, do you have enough capacity to satisfy that if you do?Well, to answer your last piece of your question first. No, there's not enough capacity in the system across multiple sub-markets. For us, we sell to every one of the fastener company. So, whether it's Boeing or Airbus it's on top of demand environment when demand is so much higher than supply. That's just not, that's just not a factor. We're oversubscribed and we anticipate that being like that for several years to come regardless of the split between widebody and single-aisle and Boeing or Airbus.Would a, would a capital investment be on the horizon for that to address?Possibly, I mean Dynamet, just like SAO is working to get up to rate as well. We're not running in Dynamet at the level we need to run at. And I want to, previous question from Cowen. I said that in fact we have a couple of pieces of equipment that are coming in here in the near term into Dynamet that will increase our finishing capacity. So, that will help as well.Okay. Great, thanks so much.Yes. Thank you, sir.The next question comes from Michael Leshock with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask here on volumes that we saw a decline in the quarter given the less shipping days. But looking forward, how do you see volumes increasing relative to price and mix? So, if your long-term guidance incorporates a 15% to 20% increase in volumes above fiscal '19, do you expect that volume uptick to be largely in fiscal '24 or is the big step up this year more so, a function of price and the volume piece is more linear over the course of your long-term guidance?Well, the volume is going to follow our productivity for the most part, I mean, as you've seen now in this quarter into next, a big part of our strategic mix management is, is moving that volume around, because some of the products as we moved to different types of products, they take longer to process through the system. Right? Especially, like in a primary mill product, it could be noted three times that just takes longer to go through the system much higher margins on that, but it takes longer. But as you see our productivity continue to increase as we've talked about as some of these other pieces come online certainly volume will be higher in the second half than the first half.And then, on maintenance, were you able to get all your normal seasonal maintenance spending done just given the lower CapEx spend sequentially and maybe running your assets above normal seasonal utilization levels? Or do you see any spilling into the second quarter?Well, we're in perpetual preventive maintenance. The days of shutting your plant down for three weeks and turning everything off and sending everyone home and doing all your preventive maintenance all over, right, that just doesn't, that's not the most efficient way. We are always in a cycle of preventative maintenance.And you know, what, I think, I've been asked why do I talk about this and you know, when you're in a situation where supply can meet demand, you know certainly no one really talks about preventive maintenance but when you're in a sold-out environment, where any amount of downtime, any amount of downtime will translate to customer impact. As a matter of product you could ship within that, that's why it makes it important. That's why it's important to say at any point in time, we're going to be doing that.Secondly, I would say it's really important to remember Mike, we have really exclusive highly sought after assets and it's our job as skilled operators to protect that equipment, obviously, over the long term. So, we're aiming for a 40% CAGR, annual CAGR over the next four years. That's our goal.Our goal is not to run, you know, run the equipment to failure simply to earn a couple more million dollars on top of already a record quarter. Right? So, I mean that that would be unprofessional. So, it's not about trying to -- let's run it more to try to get out another couple of million. We're in for the long haul. We're going to, you know, double operating income versus FY '19 over four years. So, we got to protect our equipment and treat it the right way.Got it. Appreciate all the detail.Thank you.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Huyette for any closing remarks.Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for joining us today for our fiscal year 2024 first quarter conference call. Have a great rest of your day.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T22:04:14.000-04:00
CVR Energy: Strong Financials And Business Outlook Bring Bright Future,"Figure 1 – CVI’s cash structure (in millions)Going through their balance sheet and capital structure indicates that the company was successful in improving its cash balance by circa 25% in 2Q 2023 and generated $751 million of cash versus $601 million at the end of the first quarter. $69 million of cash balance was directly from the Fertilizer segment. Moreover, they declined their net debt level by approximately 15% during the recent quarter to $878 million. It is worth noting that their nearest senior note maturity is due in 2025, and thanks to their minimal capital expenditures, the company will be able to hold cash on their balance sheet to offset their due obligations. Additionally, another positive point about their balance sheet strength is related to their $977 million equity level, which is above their debt levels, thereby decreasing the risk of financing in the future (see Figure 2).Figure 2 – CVI’s cash structure (in millions)Once looking ahead to the rest of 2023, I believe their net debt will continue to fall, thanks to the management’s guidance for minimal capital expenditures and thus higher free cash flow prospects, albeit it is not possible to be sure due to the volatile nature of this industry. In addition, after analyzing their strong balance sheet structure, it goes with no surprise to see improvements in their leverage condition. In other words, CVI’s leverage condition across the board of net debt-to-EBITDA and net debt-to-CFO illustrate that these metrics have been far lower than almost all previous quarters. In minutiae, CVI’s net debt-to-EBITDA metric sat at 2.9x in 2Q 2023. Also, their net debt-to-CFO sat at 2.3x, which despite being higher year over year compared with 1.89x in 2Q 2022, is far lower than 4.17x in the first quarter of 2023. Overall, it is worth mentioning that the severe fluctuations in their leverage condition are normal to a great extent due to the inherent volatility in their industry and operations (see Figure 3).Figure 3 – CVI’s leverage ratiosFirst and foremost crucial risk associated with CVR Energy’s operations is related to the global oil markets. Recent decisions from OPEC+ countries about cutting crude oil production to reach higher prices may have a negative impact on the company’s operating income and increase their capital spending in the Petroleum segment because they do not produce crude oil and are required to purchase crude oil that they refine. Moreover, the company’s cost to acquire feedstocks and the final price of their refined products highly relies on the supply and demand of crude oil, gasoline, and diesel. Furthermore, although global economic conditions are improving and combatting the supply constraints of last year, continuous global economic uncertainties may adversely affect their liquidity and ability to meet their outstanding obligations. Also, it is worth mentioning that approximately 25% of the net sales of the Petroleum segment and 30% of the net sales in the Nitrogen Fertilizer segment were directly from the two largest customers in 2022. As a result, if the company loses any of these customers for any reason, like their decision to purchase products with lower emissions, it can adversely affect CVI’s financial condition and cash flow.Notwithstanding the severe natural volatility of their industry, CVR Energy’s financial conditions are healthy and strong enough to absorb future risks to a great extent. The company decreased its net debt levels and expects to decrease more debt by the end of the current year. Thanks to their guidance for minimal capital expenditures and thus higher upcoming free cash flow. Additionally, the increase in their net working capital is a positive sign of their health liquidity condition. When all was said and done, CVR Energy’s strong financials and business outlook make the company a profitable investment option.As always, I appreciate your time and your comments.

Birkenstock disappoints in early trading as shares swap hands below the IPO pricing level,"Birkenstock () opened trading on Wednesday at $41 per share after pricing its highly-anticipated IPO at $46 per share. The iconic shoe seller raised $1.48B through the issuance of 32.26M ordinary shares and the pricing valued the company at $8.6B. Shares have bounced around from $40.51Based on Birkenstock's () SEC filings, the stock began trading with a higher price-to-earnings multiple than sector peers such as Skechers (), Crocs (), Steve Madden (), Deckers Outdoor (), and Wolverine World Wide (). Birkenstock () is closer on valuation to On Holding AG (), which is up more than 47% on a year-to-date basis.The 250-year-old brand saw a spike in interest during the summer after Mattel's () Barbie movie featured actress Margot Robbie wearing the Arizona Big Buckle Nubuck Leather Sandal in rose. The footwear company said it skews female generally, with women comprising 72% of its customers. However, recently Birkenstock has broadened its product range to include clogs and boots in an effort to increase its customer base. Of note, Birkenstock () is going public amid heighted concerns on consumer spending on discretionary categories such as footwear. The last significant IPO in the footwear sector was Allbirds (), which has shrunk to a market cap of $149M.Third Bridge issued some generally positive comments on Birkenstock () ahead of the IPO. The firm's experts noted that the future growth for the footwear seller could come from their improving manufacturing capabilities, which would allow the company to meet increasing global demand and venture into new markets. ""Female consumers still make up the majority of Birkenstock's customer base, primarily because of the sizing options available due to manufacturing limitations,"" noted Third Bridge's Alex Smith. It was also noted that India has tremendous market potential as Europe and the U.S. are becoming more mature markets for Birkenstock. ""However, the brand may not carry the same level of recognition in Asia as it does in Europe and the US, so building brand equity will be crucial,"" he warned.Meanwhile, Seeking Alpha analyst  was cautious on Birkenstock () ahead of the IPO. ""To justify an $8.7 billion valuation, Birkenstock would need to generate more than $3.8 billion in revenue, which is more than three times its revenue in 2022,"" he warned. Trainer ran the math on Birkenstock () to find that if the German company grew revenue at just 2X the projected industry growth level and maintained a NOPAT margin at 22% through 2030, the stock would be worth about $5.9B today or at around the $35 level.",14,2023-10-11T13:42:34.000-04:00
Black Spade Acquisition Co: Sell The VinFast Listing,"One of the hottest areas in the market over the past couple of years has been the electric vehicle space. The dramatic rise in Tesla () shares has sent investors looking for the next big winner as consumers shiftVinFast is an electric vehicle maker based in Vietnam, but it is looking to expand its global footprint. Its facilities in Southeast Asia have a maximum production capacity of 300,000 EVs per year. In May, the company announced that it would hit the U.S. stock market through a combination withThe VF 8 is a 5-seater that has an EPA estimated range of 264 miles and starts at $46,000 in the United States. For the moment, the company will have some of a pricing disadvantage against competitors who do benefit currently from federal U.S. EV tax credits, at least until it can get U.S. production going. Right now, only customers in California can order one. You can see a couple of other variants . The VF 9 is a large 7 seat SUV, and while full specs like range have not been finalized yet, it is expected to start at $83,000. The company also has a couple other vehicles , as well as a smaller SUV only available in Vietnam currently.VinFast fully phased out production of ICE vehicles in late 2022 in connection with its strategic decision to transform into an EV-only company. Like many startup electric vehicle companies, VinFast does not have the best of balance sheets currently. As the graphic below shows, cash at the end of March was less than $160 million, but the company had almost $1.75 billion of loans and borrowings. The company is likely to need additional capital over time, especially as it looks to start U.S. based production of its vehicles.The company started selling its vehicles in its home market in late 2021, and it has worked on exporting its VF8 SUV to the U.S. and other countries since. The company has met some delays due to software issues, but deliveries in the U.S. did start earlier this year. The next major phase in the process is the building of a plant in the US, which the company broke ground on in North Carolina last week. The first phase of the process will have annual vehicle production capacity of 150,000 units, with production expected to start in 2025. This should also help margins as the company sees economies of scale kick in with more material volumes, and there might be some improvement in margins from not having to import vehicles thanks to localized production. It remains to be seen if the company will qualify for any additional benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which would help reduce costs. However, that's something to discuss once the U.S. factory is close to actual production when we get more details on vehicle part sourcing and other items.The transition from ICE vehicles to EVs has resulted in a big revenue drop recently as you might expect. This is due to reduced manufacturing as the company works to ramp its EV offerings, but the top line should increase as production levels improve in the coming years. As the income statement below shows, total revenues fell off a bit in 2022, but the year over year drop from Q1 2022 to Q1 2023 was much larger. With such a small revenue base currently, the company is losing a lot of money. We've seen other startups like Lucid (), Fisker (), Rivian (), and Polestar () also lose large sums of money as they try to get to volume production of their respective vehicles.The thing that worries me most here is valuation. With over 2.3 billion shares to be outstanding after the combination, the company's implied valuation would be almost $29 billion based on Monday's rally. That's up almost $6 billion since the deal was announced in May, with the recent rally certainly helping a bit. That essentially values the company at a level that's about $3 billion more than Rivian, and nearly 70% above Lucid, yet VinFast has a fraction of the deliveries and revenues currently. Major delivery growth in the U.S. won't take place for at least another two years, and this is a very competitive market the company is trying to make a name for itself in.I could easily see a scenario where the stock drops over time, like we saw with Rivian, Lucid, Polestar, etc., as investors digest large losses and cash burn. More equity offerings could also be needed, potentially diluting investors even further down the road. However, I would caution against shorting in the near term, just because this SPAC is thinly traded, so the stock could be volatile, and there might be some bullishness if the merger is fully approved. However, I would certainly sell into strength, as the valuation just doesn't work for me here.In the end, Black Spade Acquisition Co hit a major milestone for its proposed combination with VinFast last week as SEC registration forms were deemed effective. Assuming shareholders approve the deal, VinFast will soon trade on its own rather shortly. The company will try to deliver hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles per year in a few years, but like we've seen with other startups, there likely will be many bumps in the road. With a currently implied valuation above that of Rivian, I'd be a seller of these shares here or on any further rally as we approach the combination, at least until this company gets some decent results under its belt.

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, October 26, 2023.I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Guenther, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead.Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 conference call and webcast. Turning to Slide 2, on our call today are John Romano and Jean-Francois Turgeon, Co-Chief Executive Officers; and John Srivisal, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will be using slides as we move through today’s call. You can access the presentation on our website at investor.tronox.com.Moving to Slide 3. A friendly reminder that comments made on this call and the information provided in our presentation and on our website include certain statements that are forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the specific factors summarized in our SEC filings.This information represents our best judgment based on what we knowReconciliations to their nearest U.S. GAAP terms are provided in our earnings release and in the appendix of the accompanying presentation. Additionally, please note that all financial comparisons made during the call are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.Moving to Slide 4, it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to John Romano. John?Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 4, we’ve included an introductory overview of Tronox as a reference for anyone who may be newer to our story. For more information, please visit our website. We also have a video on our homepage that does a great job of outlining the value that we bring to our customers through our vertically integrated, sustainable mining and upgrading solutions.Before turning the call over for first quarter highlights, I want to briefly comment on the situation in the Middle East. While our exposure is minimal, our hearts go out to those impacted by the conflict, and we offer our support to those who are affected.Now let’s turn to Slide 5 to review a few key messages from the quarter. We delivered third quarter performance within expectation despite softer market conditions by maintaining an unrelenting focus on managing what is within our control. Q3 saw relatively modest pricing declines across both TiO2 and zircon, as expected, despite depressed market volumes.This is a direct result of Tronox’s differentiated offering and the value customers place on Tronox as a supplier. TiO2 volumes improved sequentially in the Americas, while volumes were sequentially weaker in other regions, most prominently in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa. This contributed to an overall weaker TiO2 demand environment in Q3 than anticipated. Zircon sales volumes recovered in August and September from the low level seen in July as anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call.While overall market demand levels remain muted, we are confident that the July represents the trough, as inventory levels are relatively normal throughout the supply chain. On the operational front, we’re continuing to prudently manage utilizing rates at our pigment mining and upgrading sites as a result of lower customer demand to reduced inventory levels and generate cash.At our Botlek TiO2 facility, we experienced a supplier outage that resulted in our plant being taken offline in September. We have been working closely with our supplier and believe the plant will be restarted by November 11. Importantly, this has not disrupted our ability to fulfill customer demand, as we had sufficient inventories on hand due to our ability to reposition product from other facilities as a benefit of our global asset footprint. We have, however, incurred incremental charges from unexpected downtime due to unabsorbed fixed cost and idle facilities charges, and we’ll provide further details on that a little later in the call.Our finished goods inventory decreased in the quarter driven primarily by lower pigment inventory, partially offset by higher zircon inventories, as Atlas ramped up against a backdrop of softer market demand.Additionally, in the third quarter, we bolstered the balance sheet by proactively raising a $350 million incremental term loan, the proceeds of which were used to enhance available liquidity and will enable us to prepare for critical vertical integration capital expenditures in 2024. This is a demonstration of our commitment to balancing the medium and long-term strategic needs of the business to position Tronox for future success while ensuring we’re making the right decisions to manage what is within our control in the short-term against the current macroeconomic landscape. Our performance quarter-after-quarter is made possible by our Tronox team, to whom we extend our thanks and for their dedication and commitment.On Slide 6, we’ll review a few updates on some of our key sustainability initiatives. First, the solar project in South Africa with South African independent power producers solar group continues to progress and construction remains on track to be completed in December of 2023. Delivery of first power is expected April 1 of 2024. This is an incredibly impactful project for Tronox, and our progress toward reducing our carbon emissions.Running at full power will convert approximately 40% of our electricity to solar power in South Africa and is expected to reduce our global emissions intensity by 13% against our 2019 baseline. Renewable power projects remain the highest return, highest impact opportunities in progressing towards our stated greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. We are exploring green energy opportunities at all of our sites around the world. We are also progressing in other areas of sustainability as well, including reducing waste to external landfills.Our R&D teams are currently exploring alternative uses for waste in a number of opportunities, including cement, road base, bricks and water treatment chemicals. Additionally, we’re continuing to evaluate opportunities to extract valuable minerals and metals from waste, including rare earth, scandium and vanadium. We firmly believe that these initiatives and many others ongoing at Tronox will continue to be key in not only preserving our privilege to operate, but differentiating Tronox for key stakeholders. We look forward to continue updating you on our journey.Now let’s move to Slide 7 for a review of second quarter financial performance in more detail. Revenue of $662 million declined 17% sequentially due to lower pricing and sales volume across all products. This represented a decline of 26% relative to the prior year due to continued market softness. Income from operations was $32 million in the quarter, and we reported a net loss in the quarter of $14 million.Our normalized Q3 effective tax rate was 14%, adjusting for non-benefiting items, and our adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.08. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $116 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.5%. Free cash flow on the quarter was a use of $37 million.Now let’s move to Slide 8 for a review of our commercial performance. TiO2 revenue decreased 9% versus the second quarter, driven by a 5% decrease in sales volume and a 4% decrease in average selling prices. TiO2 sales volumes declined 14% compared to a year ago quarter, while average selling prices decreased 5%, partially offset by a 2% tailwind from favorable exchange rates.The modest decline in TiO2 pricing relative to volume levels continues to prove Tronox differentiated position and the success of our commercial strategy. Zircon volumes decreased 61% compared to the second quarter, representing a 71% decline year-over-year due to significant market softness experienced in July. As a result, zircon pricing was lower by 4% compared to the prior quarter, which represented a decrease of 3% year-over-year.Revenue from other products was $71 million, a decrease of 24% to the prior year, largely driven by lower pig iron pricing and volumes. This was partially offset by higher sales of rare earths, which improved 27% year-over-year. As a result of our unique portfolio, we are currently evaluating a range of options to leverage our expertise to further unlock the value of the rare earths generated from our mining operations in South Africa and Australia. Our differentiated integrated position sets us apart as a global leader in sustainable mining and upgrading solutions.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect pigment volumes to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter. This represents an approximate 20% increase compared to trough levels realized in the fourth quarter of 2022. We anticipate little to no seasonality in the fourth quarter as we believe customers have largely completed destocking. We do believe that we will see some restocking in the fourth quarter as customers prepare for 2024, which is reducing some of the seasonality impact.We expect that more stable pricing trends over the last year compared to the previous years of demand decline will continue. On zircon, we expect volumes to continue to recover substantially from the third quarter of 2023 trough levels. We strongly believe in our strategy of being vertically integrated in the value that our zircon provides to our customers.I’ll now turn the call over to JF for a review of our operational performance. JF?Thank you, John, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9, our adjusted EBITDA of $116 million represented a 53% decline year-on-year, driven by lower sales volume, lower product pricing and unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to lower production rate. This was partially offset by favorable exchange rate tailwind, lower freight costs and lower corporate costs. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA decreased 31% due to lower product sales volume, lower average selling price and unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to lower production rate. This was partially offset by lower freight costs, favorable exchange rate tailwind and lower corporate costs. As John mentioned, we are continuing to run our operating site at reduced rate as a result of lower demand leveled in order to manage inventory and cash.As a result, year-over-year production cost increase of $43 million, include $30 million of higher costs associated with lower absorption and higher input costs, and $13 million of lower of cost or market and idle facility charge due to lower production rate. Looking to the fourth quarter, as a result of the market dynamic John previously outlined, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be $105 million to $125 million.Turning to Slide 10. We will continue to balance the medium and long-term strategic need of the business to position Tronox for future success, while ensuring we are taking the right decision to manage what is within our control in the short-term against the current macroeconomic landscape. This includes disciplined action to reduce costs, optimizing our fixed costs, and driving additional supply chain initiatives. We are prudently managing working capital. This quarter, we reduce pigment inventory, though we built feedstock and zircon inventory.As a reminder, our mining and upgrading asset have higher fixed cost than our pigment site. So while we have reduced production level as a result of current market demand, we are balancing running at optimal rate and we will as a result build some inventory. While our long-term strategic target is to be approximately 85% vertically integrated on feedstock as a result of the current lower TiO2 production level driven by customer demand, which was down 30% year-on-year in Q1, 21% year-on-year in Q2 and 14% year-on-year in Q3, we are continuing to run our pigment asset at lower rate.This has result in higher costs this year, which will continue in the fourth quarter. On capital expenditure, as we have highlighted previously, we will invest approximately $270 million this year to adapt to the macroeconomic environment as it unfold by delaying investment primarily associated with volume grow not required in the short-term.While this will delay our ability to realize the benefits from our key capital project, we do believe this is the appropriate decision for the business at this time and it’s consistent with our ability to flex our capital spend. We will continue to balance cash generation, while ensuring we have the product necessary to meet our customer need and are effectively positioning Tronox for future success.I want to briefly provide our latest comment on Jazan. As we have disclosed in our filing, the original Jazan Option Agreement expired on May 10, 2023. We extended our agreement with TASNEE such that until November 1, 2023, all chloride slag produced by the Slagger will be delivered to Tronox as repayment in kind of the $125 million Tronox loan to the project. We received shipment of the chloride slag, which reduced the loan balance and the related accrued interest by $27 million in the third quarter.Full repayment of the Tronox loan is required by January 2025 in either cash or in kind through chloride slag delivery. Tronox and TASNEE additionally agree to extend the term of the Technical Service Agreement to November 1 to enable Tronox’s continued support to the Jazan’s smelter complex, while negotiations are going on. We will keep the market update on the statues.Before I turn the call over, I would like to provide a few word on yesterday announcement of my upcoming retirement. I’m extremely honored to have played a part in Tronox transformation over the last ten year. I strongly believe the company has never been better positioned to continue navigating the current environment and generate meaningful value for shareholder.I look forward to the future ahead for Tronox and I wish John the best as he take over, having absolute confidence he is the right choice to continue to lead the company. I would like to thank the Board, John and my colleagues for an incredible journey at Tronox. It is the effort of all of our employee that make Tronox what it is today. And with John’s vision and leadership, this will continue to evolve for the better.I will now turn the call over to John Srivisal for a review of our financial position. John?Thank you, JF, and congratulations. We are all grateful for the invaluable contributions you’ve made to Tronox. Turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with total debt of $2.8 billion and net debt of $2.6 billion. Our net leverage at the end of September was 4.8 times on a trailing 12-month basis. The incremental term loan of $350 million raise in the third quarter reinforced the strength of our balance sheet and bolstered available liquidity ahead of anticipated critical vertical integration related capital expenditures in 2024.This transaction increased total available liquidity by approximately $350 million while net leverage remained net neutral as we use the proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facilities with the remaining going to cash. Our nearest term significant maturities remain 2028 and we have no financial covenants on our term loans or bonds.We maintain interest rate swaps such that approximately 73% of our interest rates are fixed through 2024 and approximately 64% are fixed from 2024 through 2028, aligning with the maturity of our term loans. Total available liquidity as of September 30 was $726 million, including $246 million in cash and cash equivalents, which is well distributed across our global operations.Capital expenditures totaled $54 million in the quarter, approximately 55% of this was for maintenance and safety, and 45% was for strategic growth projects. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $67 million for the quarter.As John mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was a use of $37 million. We reduced our pigment inventory levels in the quarter. Offsetting this benefit was increased feedstock levels due to lower pigment plant production as well as higher zircon inventories, as Atlas ramped up against a backdrop of softer market demand. We returned $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.Moving to Slide 12. Based on our current view that John and JF outlined, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be $105 million to $125 million. Pivoting to our expectations for our 2023 cash uses, our working capital assumption increased to a use of approximately $185 million. While we are continuing to actively manage working capital, including continuing to reduce pigment inventories through year end, the increase is a result of the softer market conditions driving higher than expected zircon inventory levels.Our net cash interest expense is expected to be $125 million, our cash taxes are expected to be approximately $40 million, and our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $270 million for the year. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments.I will now turn the call back over to John Romano for a few closing comments before we get to questions. John?Thanks, John. I wanted to also congratulate JF on his upcoming retirement and thank him for being an extremely valuable partner and a force of positive change in our company over many years. It’s been an honor to serve in this role as Co-CEO together with him and especially with someone for whom I hold an immense amount of respect. I’m excited about the future for Tronox, and I’m confident it will be a smooth transition over the next six months.And with that, we’d like to turn the call over to questions. Operator?Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes. Good morning, guys. Just a question on your expectations going into the fourth quarter, it seems like you guys are more bullish on volumes for both TiO2 and zircon. I think most others have kind of commented they see things continuing to be down. Can you just walk through what underscores your belief that volumes will be flat? What are you seeing in the market for both zircon and TiO2, please?Yes. Thanks, Duffy. So on TiO2, we said relatively flat. And part of that has to do with – the market has already – has been significantly down for the last eight quarters, we’ve seen volumes down. And we called the bottom in the fourth quarter of 2022 and we’ve continually seen that uptick. We do believe that all the destocking has run its course. And when we look at our order book for the fourth quarter, that reference to – little to no seasonal demand, we’re seeing some areas in areas like Asia Pacific where our volumes are actually up in the fourth quarter. So is that because the market has recovered significantly? No. Part of it is just because customers are starting to order again.So we feel pretty confident in where we are at this stage. We’re a third of the way through the quarter. We’ve got good visibility in where our order book is at this particular stage. I mean, there is a range that we provided, but at this particular stage, on the volume side of the equation, we are continuing to see things move in the right direction as we move into first quarter next year. And we’ll provide more guidance on 2024. But we’re cautiously optimistic that we’re moving in the right direction for a recovery on TiO2.On zircon, the third quarter was the lowest quarter we’ve had in many, many years. And when we think about where we are, we called the bottom in July, we saw volumes pick up significantly in August and September. So when we look at the fourth quarter, based on our forward order book, our volumes are expected to be up over the third quarter by more than 50%. So we’re coming from a very low base, but those volumes are up and we feel confident in what those numbers are looking like in the fourth quarter at this stage. So I hope that answered your question.That is helpful. Thank you. And then on the comment, did I hear that right, working capital is going to eat $185 million in cash this year? And if that’s right, what do we need to see next year for that to be released?Yes. And Duffy, that’s correct. We are guiding $185 million use for the full year. Obviously, we do expect Q4 to be a generator of cash. If you count through LTM, the first nine months of the year, we’re roughly at the $218 million use. So we will have a benefit for the fourth quarter. We do see – we have managed our inventory down pretty well, so we’ve brought down production levels. But frankly, the driver here on inventory, as we mentioned, is the zircon market.So continue to produce, obviously, we’re running our minds. Zircon is a product that comes out of it. So we’re building inventory, roughly $50 million build in the second half of the year, that’s driving that. So as we look towards 2024, we do expect to be working capital to be a use. Obviously – sorry, expect working capital to be a source of cash for 2024. As we do expect, as John mentioned, we do expect the market to recover. So we do expect to sell the inventory, draw that down, and generate significant amount of cash.And Duffy, I would add, we obviously – it’s zircon, but it’s also high grade feedstock, because we have slow down our mine, but we have not slowed them down as much as our pigment plant. And because of that, we have built some feedstock.That’s right. Yes. Obviously, we brought down pigment production, but we’re not using the feedstock. So that’s building this year as well.Great. Thank you, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the Q4 volume expectations and TiO2, how good is your visibility? And you mentioned some potential restocking. How confident are you on that occurring either in Q4 or Q1?Well, we’ve provided guidance for Q4. And again, based on our forward order book at this particular stage and what we’re seeing in the month of October, which is largely past, we’re seeing some of that rebuild happening. And again, it’s not happening in every region. So that rebuild is having an impact or dampening effect on what we would normally see as seasonal demand downturn. So in a normal year, and again, you got to go back a while to find a normal year, but you’d say high-single digits kind of decrease in demand in the fourth quarter for seasonal adjustments, we’re seeing nothing in that range.So a lot of it has to do with customers having destocked significantly and having to start rebuild some of the inventory. So I’d say, in some areas, it’s going back to normal buying patterns, which they have not been on for more than three quarters.And John, we can add that obviously Q3 was a very low volume quarter. So that’s why being flattish for Q4 is not a great quarter.Understood. That’s helpful. And just on the CapEx for next year, can you talk to the increase? And is there any potential for further delays, if the macro remains or even gets more challenging from here? Thank you.Look, maybe I can cover that. Look, we obviously wanted to be in a good position to continue to invest in our vertical integration. And we have a couple of projects in our mine in South Africa that will create a lot of value. And when we talk investing in mine, you’re talking of project that will take couple of years to realize, but then they had ten-year of benefit to the company. And we will obviously adjust that capital requirement based on what we will see the economy of the world do.We always said we have some flexibility with our capital, but there is some good project that will add value to the business that we consider doing at the moment, based on what we’re seeing. I mean, we expect 2024 to be better than 2023. I mean, we called the downturn for TiO2 in Q4 2022, and we still commit that that was the case. And the downturn for zircon was in Q3 this year, and we’re seeing things improving, and we expect 2024 that will continue to improve for zircon as well.I mean, if there was some sort of unforeseen event, a war escalated somewhere, we needed to make adjustment, we do have flexibility on that 350 and we would adjust accordingly.Yes, we’ve obviously guided 270 for this year. And as John mentioned, we expect in the mid-300s next year, not the levels that we had in 2022, but we do have flexibility even in that 350 number.Very good. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector at UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And first, thanks JF, for all the contributions over the years and congrats, John. So I wanted to ask on the fourth quarter guidance, not on volumes, but on the EBITDA side. So if you see a 50% uptick in zircon, my math is that that kind of gets me to the top end of your guidance alone. So I’m just wondering within the other puts and takes, outside of TiO2 volumes, is there something else you’re assuming on price or is there some additional roll through of cost, because of the idle facility charges that ramps into fourth quarter and how would that progress into early next year?Yes. I think the key drivers of the range for our Q4 EBITDA guide is primarily commercial. So you’re right, Josh, that obviously pricing is going to play a part of it outside of the zircon volumes. As we’ve mentioned, we did have an outage at Botlek due to our supplier next door, and that’s really a driver as well. It’s $5 million in Q3. And so just depending on we expect it to get up in November 11 in a couple of days now – a couple of weeks now, but that may create some further burden depending on when that gets up.Yes. That’s a third-party provider of steam, which we need to actually finish the pigment there. So we believe and we have confidence in what they’ve been telling us on coming up on November the 11, but that’s definitely something that could create some sort of variance in that number.Okay, thanks. And just kind of looking into early next year, not necessarily anything volumes or price related, but more the cost side, I guess, with how you’re operating your mines. I guess, I just want to understand that you guys kind of changed how you operated mid this year. You’re taking more charges now as we look at you plan into next year. Does that burden increase or decrease on your EBITDA as we think about the first half next year versus second half this year?Yeah, I think one of the things we – the question that came earlier about working capital, the other issue that’s impacting working capital is also the cost of our inventory. So our costs have definitely gone up and it takes a little bit of time to work that through. So we’re still going to see – we’re going to be burdened with higher costs from the inventory that we have in the system as we make that high grade feedstock that openly goes into our TiO2 production. So it will take a little bit of time for that to work its way through the system. John, did you want to…No, that’s exactly the answer.Got it. All right, thanks guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up to Josh’s call. So if – I think you said earlier that 3Q had about a $38 million hit tied to higher fixed cost absorption. And it seems like that’s something that’s going to continue to drag on. To your point, you’ve got high cost inventory to work through. Is this something that based on the higher inventory levels that you have on the ore front that can drag through most of 2024, or is that too draconian in terms of how we think about kind of the pressures that that high cost inventory and high fixed cost absorbed inventory works its way through the system. I guess, how should we be kind of gauging that as we look to next year?Yes, John, good question. And I’d say, through year end, we’d expect that cost to flow off in our results within the first four to five months of next year.And it’s not just feedstock, John, either. We’ve been pretty open about how we’re running our assets on the TiO2 side at 70% capacity utilization. So as we start to see the market picking up, we’ll start to ramp those plants back up and that fixed cost absorption from those finishing facilities will start to come down. And quite frankly, there are some assets that were already starting to move up in response to some of the things that we’re seeing, but we’re still running those assets well below full capacity.Got it. Okay. No, that’s helpful. And then maybe just a little bit of color, I think you had mentioned in one of the responses just that – if you were actually starting to see some demand pull in Asia and it’s probably not demand driven, it’s more restock, it sounded like. But I guess do you have clarity or do you have much comfort in where inventory levels are in Asia or any of the major regions and how much below normal they may be at this point? Is there a way to kind of give us a little bit of color around that?Well, I think the simplest thing is that from our salespeople and the engagement that we have out with our customers, they do get out and have very – a lot of dialogue with customers around where inventory is. I think at the end of the day, there’s still pricing activity going on there. And when we start to pull back from requests to reduce price and customers continue ordering at the same levels that gives you an idea that you’re towards the end of what typically tends to be a downturn.So it’s our belief that customer destocking has run its course. Orders are picking up. I mean, even in China, we’re seeing orders picking up. That’s not because China has rebounded significantly, it’s because our inventories and the inventories inside the industry there have gotten to a low level, it’s not sustainable. So I think there’s an element. I mean, India, for instance, India is still a very strong market for us. It’s an area where there’s a significant amount of Chinese exports that go into India, but our volumes into India are continuing to be strong, and it’s one of the bright spots.Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color. And, JF, congratulations and enjoy the retirement for sure.Thank you, John.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch at Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hey, good morning. And let me echo my congratulations to you, JF, been a pleasure working with you, and of course, looking forward to working with you, John, in your new role. I’d like to come back to price. You indicated that the pricing weakness that you saw year-over-year and sequentially was mainly in Asia and Latin America. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the pricing in North America and Europe and what your expectations are for the balance of the year in TiO2.Yes. Thanks, Frank. So we don’t typically give a lot of detail and color on regional pricing, but what you said is accurate, right. We saw a lot of more movement on pricing activity in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. And even in Europe, there’s been, what I would say, a fair amount of competitive activity in certain areas where people are still struggling to try to pick up volume.And we haven’t been responding to those, what I would call, spot requests for price reduction on offers that we don’t think are reasonable. So pricing is still, I’d say, moving in different regions. North America, it’s not as if we haven’t seen any price erosion. There has been some, but it’s been more stable than most regions. And in Asia Pacific, I would say, we’ve seen most of the down cycle movement on pricing. And not to say that it’s going to start moving up, but in this particular environment, in China specifically, we have seen what we believe to be the bottom on pricing.And we have a facility there that we’re now operating at a higher rate, because we’re seeing stronger demand. And you’ve heard about price increases coming out in China, and we have had some implementation of those price increases in China. So, again, it’s hard for us to actually pinpoint exactly when we’ll see the complete bottom on price erosion and when that start to – when that inflection point is on the upside. But we feel pretty confident about what we said on the call, and that is – this stability that we’ve seen, considering the volume environment that we’re in, we would expect that to continue moving into 2024.Okay. Got you. That’s very helpful. And then I’d like to come back to zircon, obviously, volumes in July were very much the story, and I believe you indicated on the last call, you anticipated your zircon volumes to be down 15,000 to 20,000 KT or 15,000 to 20,000 tons. And was wondering, where did that actually come in? And can you revisit the air pocket that you saw in demand in July? How anomalous is that? How concerned are you about hitting another one of these air pockets as we progress through this year into next year?Yes. So, Frank, I would say that was anomalous, and we don’t expect that to recur. You had a significant downturn in China that basically nothing was rebounding there. There’s a significant amount of Ti – or in zircon that’s consumed there. And there was an inflection point where customers started to think that they could actually get price reductions, so they just stopped buying. And that was July. And we said that we would expect to see that pick back up in August and September.The 10,000 to 15,000 tons that we projected to be down, we were down a bit more than that. But what we’ve seen as we move into the fourth quarter into October and in November, as I mentioned, the volumes are up significantly from that low in 3Q or the third quarter, and we were expecting volumes to be up more than 50% from that third quarter number.Okay, great. Thank you, John.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead at Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just one for me. I wanted to go back to the cash and inventory discussion, I appreciate everything you’ve said about focus on managing working capital. But just when I look at the numbers, Tronox’s dollar amount of inventory has gone up for eight consecutive quarters now, whereas most all chemical companies are generating cash this year from working capital. So why is that not the case for Tronox? Or maybe why are you not pulling back production rates even more to generate faster cash?Yes. Thanks for that question. I think it’s two-fold. Obviously, while we have reduced our pigment production down, which is driving a significant generator of cash, our mining as well, we’ve slowed as well. But as I mentioned earlier, zircon is building. So it was about $25 million a quarter. As I mentioned earlier, it’s about $50 million increase for the second half of the year. I think part of what you’re seeing as well is our input costs continue to remain very high. So it’s significantly elevated from about two years ago. I think we’ve quoted historically, it’s over $400 million increase from 2020 to 2022. So that’s part of the reason why we aren’t seeing. While reduction in total volume is down, pricing still remains pretty elevated.Not dissimilar to our price, some people have said it’s a bit stickier than it was before. It’s been similar on the raw materials, but we’re starting to gain some traction on that. So we’re starting to see those raw material prices move down. We would expect as we go through the fourth quarter and the first quarter next year, we’ll continue to see benefits from that.And as JF mentioned as well, the feedstock is a big component of the increase. So we do slowdown our production plants, but we are vertically integrated. So we are running our mines and building that feedstock inventory.Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Good morning, John and JF. JF, first of all, best of luck. Wishing you all the best for your retirement. My question, first question is around your margins, EBITDA margins. I mean obviously, the margin squeeze has been pretty extreme 17.5% in Q3 of 2023, down from 21.2% in Q2 and 27.6% same period last year. So my question really is, I mean I’d imagine part of the margin squeeze is the fixed cost absorption side of things, lower zircon pricing and the like. But you guys always talk about the virtue of integration. You guys are obviously the most integrated guys out there.I’m just trying to get a better sense of what the cost curves are looking like right now, right? I mean, if you guys have seen this sort of a margin squeeze and are reporting 17.5% EBITDA margins, I’d like to think a large chunk of your global competitors are maybe even below breakeven levels, right? I mean, how should we be thinking about that as it pertains to call it pricing on a go forward basis?Its great – thanks for the question. It’s John, and it’s a great question. 17.5% EBITDA margins for us is, we’ve been talking about being in the 20%s for a long period of time. Part of ours was in fact due to zircon coming down significantly more than we thought it would. But there’s no question, I mean, there’s companies that are in the restructuring process right now. We’ve stated last three calls that we believe that most of the Chinese producers are not making any money.So you’ve started that inflection point on pricing moving in the other direction and you’ve got exports coming out of China in the 1.5 to 1.6 million tons on a trailing 12-month basis and customers can only absorb so much of that even with that price difference. So I think that there’s absolutely a point in time where pricing needs to go in the other direction or the profitability of the industry is going to get to the point where people start closing down assets.And again, I think that’s where we are at this particular stage. There’s not a lot of room fixed when we talk about the high grade feedstock, pricing hasn’t moved much on that. Ilmenite pricing has remained north of $400 a ton. So with input costs like that, there’s got to be an inflection point at some point in time.Very fair, very fair. And just sort of carrying on with that thought, on the input side – input cost side of things, look, I mean there is some skittishness around sort of call it chlorine pricing there is with housing doing what it’s doing and the like. I mean there is a school of thought that chlorine pricing may come down on a go forward basis.And similarly, I mean like you said, ore pricing through this entire downturn has held up quite well. But again, one hears more and more about there being ample supply of ore. So as you think about beyond Q4 call it, how do you think the input cost side of things will shake out broadly for the industry and specifically for you guys? Because obviously that’s going to play a role in your sort of integrated margins on a go forward basis as well.Hassan, maybe I’ll start by your second point on the ore holding. Look, I think that there was a good response by the producer. I think that I mean we have a big producer in Australia that has announced shutting down its production asset for the whole Q4. You have the biggest producer in the industry that has furnace down and that’s in the public domain we have said that we have adjust our production as well.So all of the key raw material producer have adjust to that slow demand market. So that’s – I think that’s why the price has hold stable for feedstock on the supply…Maybe just a little bit on the input cost, you made reference to chlorine, right, that one has gotten a lot of publicity for many quarters and our procurement team did a really good job of creating some opportunities for us to try to leverage an opportunity to get lower pricing. We made reference on the last call that we were going to see a price decrease in the third quarter. It’s pretty public that chlorine prices have started to move. Caustic prices have started to move. So that’s what we talked about that – with regards to chlorine, we would expect just continue to see some opportunity there.And then on other raws, John made reference that we hadn’t seen as much downward movement on pricing, on our raw materials that we had expected. And we are – but we’re starting to see that moving into the end of this year and into the first quarter next year as we start those negotiations for 2024 contracts.Very helpful. Thank you so much, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi, this is Turner Hinrichs on for Vincent. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on the supplier outage as it relates to building a bridge from your 3Q to your 4Q expectations. Will you be able to continue serving customer demand fully out of inventory? And does it imply any additional logistical or other costs that we should consider when building the bridge?Yes. Look, so from the standpoint of being able to continue to supply customers, we made reference that we had inventory in place. We also have a footprint that allows us to move inventory around to make sure we can meet that demand. So at this particular stage, based on the November 11 startup that we talked about, we don’t expect to miss any orders. There will be some additional costs attached to moving that material around. John mentioned the reality is – there will be an opportunity for an insurance claim.We won’t see that in the numbers probably until 2024, but all those additional costs that are attached to that outage at Botlek will be factored into that. And at this particular stage, I mentioned during the call or at some point in the Q&A that we were also ramping up some of our plants to make sure that we had inventory to meet the needs should there be any further downturn on that. But at this particular stage, based on what we’re hearing from our supplier, we still feel pretty comfortable that November 11 start date for Botlek is firm.We’ve mentioned Q3 was burdened about $5 million from the Botlek outage. Since we’re up pretty early in the month, around mid of the month, you expect that only to be a couple of million burden in October.Great. Thanks so much for that color. Another one, do you mind providing some additional color to level set our expectations for underlying demand in the macro by region as well as what you’re seeing for TiO2 export trends.Yes. So on the export trends for TiO2 out of China, we saw a tick up in the month of September. I made reference that on a trailing 12-month, it’s about 1.5 to 1.6 million tons. That number was increased because you had a couple of months that fell off that trailing 12-month that were very low. But we continue to compete with the Chinese in areas where we select to.There are some instances where we made some reference that we had to make some adjustments on pricing to maintain what we would define some strategic share in Latin America and the Middle East. But we’re not expecting any significant change in exports at this particular stage. As far as demand regionally, we don’t typically provide specifics on breakdown on where we’re seeing growth by region. We’re seeing volumes specifically in Asia-Pacific and even in the Middle East where volumes are up Q3 to Q4 and that’s largely driven to destocking running its course and customers needing to make refill their inventory.Yes. Okay. Thank you. Congrats to both JF and John as well.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thanks very much. Producer price indexes peaked in – maybe in November 2022, and producer price indexes have been dropping since that time. Has that made any difference to your TiO2 pricing? Is that one of the factors that’s pressuring them lower?Thanks, Jeff. PPI indexes don’t have anything to do with any of our contracts. Maybe some of our competitors out there have had some PPI indexes that had impact on their pricing or might be tied to contracts. But we don’t use PPI as an indicator on TiO2 for any specific tie to pricing. Not to say that it hasn’t had any impact. If others are using PPI indexes, it could have had an impact on where – what they’re doing, which could drive competitive behavior. Hope that answered your question.Yes. Thank you. You talked about having to meet prices of Chinese competitors. Is that in chloride based titanium dioxide or sulfate based TiO2 or both?It’s predominantly on the sulfate side in China, and the gap between the sulfate and the chloride has been significant. So when we say make some adjustments to maintain strategic share, it doesn’t mean we’re meeting sulfate pricing on Chinese. It means that we had to be more competitive to prevent customers not migrating more of their volume away from the chloride TiO2 to the sulfate. So specific to sulfate and chloride not meeting it, just having to make some adjustments to narrow the gap.Is China more competitive in chloride now?I think over time, China, they’ve gotten – [indiscernible] has gotten more competitive. Their grades are more competitive. We’ve heard they’ve had some quality issues here recently. So I think the short answer to your question is, over time, the quality of the chloride material has gotten better. And in certain areas, we’re competing with more than billions specifically on a head-to-head basis. But its – I think there’s an element of our customers not wanting to have all of their eggs in the Chinese basket, that’s why there’s a limitation to what we believe they can do to substitute Chinese material for Western material.Great. Thank you very much.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Roger Spitz at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is…Thanks very much. Good morning. I know you don’t want to give numbers on this, but maybe you can just talk generally about your European TiO2 pigment, EBITDA on Q3 versus Q2. Can you talk about how much – how that changed, how much it changed? You don’t have to put numbers on it, but if we talk just in generalities.Yes. I think just generally speaking, in Europe, Q2 to Q3 costs are up. So its – we’re seeing the some of the burden of that.Got it.We don’t ever provide breakdowns by region on EBITDA.Sure, sure. So the free cash flow guidance OCF [ph] less CapEx that you’ve given, that implies negative 75 for the full year. Is that – am I looking at that correctly?Correct.Got it. And last…I think we’ve previously quoted we’d be relatively flat free cash flow for the full year. And a lot of that bridge, obviously, is what I mentioned earlier, the zircon build $50 million of it, and then we obviously earnings is an impact of it as well.Got it. And I know you’ve chatted about this a little bit, but I mean if the economy remains relatively weak, how quickly can you monetize and sell down the big zircon and high grade slag inventories that you built up here recently in 2024? I mean I guess that’s not an easily noble question, but that’s my concern anyway.I think, Roger, we’re very confident in our free cash flow position. I mean that’s why early in the year, John and I, we borrowed that additional $350 million that was to pay down what I call the short-term debt, to have liquidity, to be in a very strong position for any condition to happen in 2024. And look, we are, I mean we feel like there is no risk. Look, we have built $185 million of working capital, as John mentioned. It’s zircon, it’s feedstock, it’s ilmenite.It’s all material that have no shell life, no – and that at some point, we will sell and we will convert into cash. Look, it’s too bad that we had to accumulate that much in 2023, but it will obviously be a relief in 2024. And we don’t have any risk of not being able to monetize the sales of zircon or slag or TiO2 for a matter.The only thing is that we don’t sell slag in the market, right? So when we talk about selling down slag, it’s selling down slag through the production of TiO2. So we’re not a seller of high grade feedstock out in the market.Yes. And I mean at Q2, we had $450 million approximate liquidity and obviously this bolstered our liquidity and part of that was in both cases very strong. We weren’t going to make any drastic decisions that will sacrifice the business in the longer-term, so we would not sell zircon at all costs.Got it. Thank you very much.Thank you. And as there are currently no further questions in the queue, I’ll hand the floor back to John Romano, Co-CEO for the closing comments.Thank you for that. And look, thank you for joining us for the call today. Our key priorities for 2023 remain unchanged. And we’re going to remain relentless on focusing on our sustainability and safety, continuing to align our production with customer demand and prudently reducing our cost, managing our key capital projects without losing sight of the long-term benefits to Tronox, including reducing our cost per ton, managing our working capital and free cash flow in the current market environment.So, with that, I’d like to thank you all for joining and again, thank, JF for all of the great work he’s done and really has been a pleasure to be Co-CEO with you and look forward to working with you between now and April 1 and as a Board member, so thank you.Thank you.Thank you. This now concludes the conference. Thank you all very much for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-26T13:28:02.000-04:00
Tesla expects capex spending to top $9B in 2023,"Tesla () disclosed in a SEC filing on Monday that it expects capital expenditures to exceed $9B in 2023, and land in a range of $7B to $9B in each of the following two fiscal years.""Our capital expenditures areIn the 10-Q filing, Tesla () also noted that its business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of its level of capital spending level. Sales growth was also generally facilitating positive cash generation due in part to better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding. TSLA plans to continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand its product roadmap, and provide financing options to customers. However, Tesla () also noted it is likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, TSLA expects its ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in sales.Shares of Tesla () fell  in premarket trading on Monday and are now down more than 17% over the last week.",54,2023-10-23T07:04:34.000-04:00

Endeavour Mining: Portfolio Optimization Helps Maintain Industry-Leading Margins,"It's been a mediocre Q2 Earnings Season with the Gold Miners Index () down over 5% since it began last month, and suffering a drawdown of 10% at last week's lows. These mixed results can be attributed to one-time headwinds for some mines (extremeEndeavour Mining released its Q2 results earlier this month, reporting quarterly production of ~311,000 ounces of gold (all operations) or ~267,600 ounces of gold (continuing operations), a 10% decline from the year-ago period. The sharp decline in gold production was largely expected due to being up against tough year-over-year comps and a back-end weighted production profile this year with higher grades at Kari Pump & Vindaloo Main and increased stope production at Wona UG in H2, as well as what was forecasted to be a better H2 from its recently divested assets (Boungou and Wahgnion). So, while this decline in production might appear alarming, the production levels do not reflect the overall potential of this portfolio, which looks to have 1.50+ million ounce per annum potential long-term even post divestment.Digging into the operations a little closer, the company's Sabodala-Massawa Mine produced ~78,600 ounces of gold (Q2 2022: ~72,900 ounces), an 8% increase from the year-ago period. The higher output was driven by increased throughput (~1.2 million tonnes) and slightly better recoveries on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by lower grades (2.17 grams per tonne vs. 2.38 grams per tonne). As noted by the company, the grade decline was related to lower contributions from high-grade ore sources (Sofia North, Bambaraya, and Sabodala pits), and all-in sustaining costs of $762/oz remained at industry-leading levels, benefiting from lower sustaining capital partially offset by higher maintenance, fuel, and labor costs.However, with ~140,100 ounces produced year-to-date and guidance for ~327,000 ounces or better at the midpoint, investors can look forward to a robust H2 out of this asset from an output standpoint. Meanwhile, Endeavour noted it has committed ~$219 million of a planned ~$290 million in growth capital for the ongoing Expansion Project, with pricing in line with expectations and project completion expected in June 2024. Also of note is that the company is looking at building a 37MW PV solar facility 3 kilometers from the site, which will allow Endeavour to benefit from $0.015/kWh power costs, down from $0.18/kWh from the heavy fuel oil generated cost of power currently. This could allow for a 20% plus reduction in power costs per annum at a modest cost of $55 million, with a Q1 2025 planned start date.Moving over to one of Endeavour's other large mines, Ity, the asset produced ~85,900 ounces of gold in the period, a 12% improvement year-over-year, with it also reporting industry-leading all-in sustaining costs of $797/oz (Q2 2022: $895/oz). Ity's higher output was driven by another quarter of impressive throughput levels (~1.81 million tonnes processed at 1.61 grams per tonne of gold) and improved recoveries, offsetting the lower grades in the period. As noted by Endeavour, increased throughput in H1 benefited from the use of the surge bin while recoveries benefited from less semi-refractory feed in the ore blend. As for costs, they benefited from lower sustaining capital year-over-year, helping the mine to report costs over 40% below the industry average in Q2 (~$797/oz vs. ~$1,350/oz).Finally, at the company's Mana Mine, production fell off sharply vs. the year-ago period, coming in at just ~31,100 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,481/oz. This was certainly a disappointing result relative to Q2 2022 output of ~54,800 ounces at $905/oz, but the performance was softer for two reasons. For starters, the asset was up against very difficult comparisons with a feed grade just shy of 2.90 grams per tonne gold in Q2 2022. Second, the asset had abnormally low sustaining capital in the period, translating to a much lower AISC figure in the year-ago period. So, while underground tonnes mined were up in Q2 2023, there was less stope production from Siou UG and primarily low-grade development ore from Wona Underground. In addition, the mine saw a much higher strip ratio for open-pit tonnes in the period, and combined with inflationary pressures (fuel, consumables), costs rose materially.Unfortunately, the slower ramp-up for the new mining contractor at Wona UG means the Mana Mine is unlikely to meet its FY2023 guidance of 190,000 to 210,000 ounces at $950/oz to $1,050/oz all-in sustaining costs, which is not surprising with year-to-date production at ~75,000 ounces at $1,277/oz. Fortunately, we will see better performance in H2 as stope production ramps up from Wona UG, and mined grades are expected to improve at Siou UG as well. To summarize, while the tough H1 at Mana with a new mining contractor (that's also new to Africa) was unfortunate, I would expect much better results going forward from Mana, with more normalized production levels (~50,000 ounces per quarter) set to translate to a dramatic reduction in unit costs.As it stands, Endeavour's continuing operations are tracking well behind updated FY2023 guidance midpoint of 1,095,000 ounces (~511,000 ounces year-to-date), but as noted earlier, the company expects a back-end weighted H2. This is expected at all of its sites with the exception of Ity, which is tracking ahead of guidance, setting Endeavour up for a solid Q3 and Q4 performance across nearly all of its mines. Meanwhile, from a cost standpoint, FY2023 AISC is expected to come in over 25% below the industry average at sub $950/oz, solidifying Endeavour's position as one of the sector's lowest-cost producers with scale next to  ().Finally, on M&A, news was released in late June that Endeavour Mining was looking at Kinross () as a possible acquisition target, but that talks did not advance past the initial stage due to differences in valuation. When questioned on the Q2 Conference Call, Endeavour's CEO Sebastien de Montessus reaffirmed their plan to remain disciplined and that it does not need M&A given its strong pipeline. I believe this is the right move and that only opportunistic M&A for quality assets makes sense, especially when the company is uncovering high-grade near-surface ore at a cost of less than $30/oz in regions where it's already present. And while Kinross would be a nice fit and provide improved diversification with two large-scale low-cost assets in Tasiast (Mauritania) and Paracatu (Brazil) and a strong development asset in Great Bear (Canada), it's encouraging to see the company being strict on the price it's willing to pay.- Q2 Conference Call, Endeavour President & CEO, Sebastien de MontessusMoving over to costs and margins, Endeavour reported all-in sustaining costs of $1,136/oz in Q2 (all operations), or $1,000/oz based on solely continuing operations. While this was an increase from Q2 2022 levels, the $1,136/oz costs are not reflective of the current portfolio with the divestment of smaller high-cost assets that dragged up costs in the period (Boungou: $2,147/oz, Wahgnion: $1,817/oz). In addition, costs were elevated in H1 2023 due to lower production levels at its core assets, but we should see a meaningful improvement in costs during H2 with the benefit of higher production and sales. Plus, despite the increase in costs in Q2, costs still remained well below the industry average (red shaded bars).Looking at Endeavour's AISC margins, the company reported an average realized gold price of $1,947/oz in the period (Q2 2022: $1,879/oz), resulting in minimal margin compression despite ($811/oz vs. $839/oz) the higher costs from its non-core assets that were sold in the period. And on a continuing basis, AISC margins came in at industry-leading levels of $947/oz, and are set to improve even further in H2 if the gold price continues to cooperate. Plus, between the addition of a low-cost asset in Lafigue (sub $900/oz), improved unit costs at Mana, increased production from one of its highest-margin assets (Sabodala-Massawa), and room to further improve costs with a grid connection at Sabodala-Massawa plus a solar facility, Endeavour certainly has a path to maintain its sub-$950/oz AISC and its spot as one of the highest-margin producers sector-wide.Given the solid cost performance across the board despite higher costs from Mana and the benefit of a higher gold price, Endeavour reported revenue of $524.1 million in Q2 and operating cash flow of ~$160 million. This helped the company to finish the quarter with less than $200 million in net debt (~$840 million in cash) despite elevated growth capital spend of ~$104 million in the period, and the company remains on budget and schedule at its key growth projects, with completion in late Q2 and Q3 2024 for Sabodala-Massawa and Lafigue, respectively. And assuming both remain on schedule, we should see Endeavour grow its production profile to 1.22+ million ounces in 2024 and 1.35+ million ounces in 2025, offsetting nearly all of the lost ounces from its recently divested assets.As for recent developments, the major news in the quarter was that Endeavour divested its two non-core assets in Burkina Faso (Boungou and Wahgnion), which will lead to lower production this year and next year. The company sold these assets for upwards of $300 million to Lilium Mining in upfront and deferred cash and royalties. The company noted that this is a positive from a security standpoint in Burkina Faso as both mines are close to each other, allowing it to direct its security efforts into a single area of the country. However, the major news in Q2 was the continued exploration success at Tanda-Iguela in eastern Cote d'Ivoire that has prompted to increase its already aggressive exploration budget. In fact, drilling at Tanda-Iguela came in at ~95,000 meters in H1, beating out Hope Bay where Agnico Eagle () is also drilling aggressively (~89,000 meters drilled in H1), and drilling at Tanda-Iguela is expected to total 180,000 meters this year.For those unfamiliar, this asset started with 395 square kilometers of land (Tanda permit and northern portion of the Tanda-Iguela Property), which was added to Endeavour's portfolio in late 2015 following the La Mancha transaction. Endeavour added to this asset when it was awarded the Iguela permit (298 square kilometers) in 2017, located south of the Tanda permit. The addition of this second major parcel of land was certainly a smart move by the company given that in just 15 months of drilling, the company released a maiden resource last year of ~3.0 million ounces at 2.0+ grams per tonne of gold, made up of ~14.9 million tonnes at 2.33 grams per tonne of gold (indicated category) and ~1.9 million ounces at ~1.80 grams per tonne of gold (inferred category). Notably, the mineralized system at the Assafou deposit covers just 20% of the 3-kilometer-long mineralized system and is conveniently located near grid power, benefits from 95%+ recovery rates, with average processing recoveries of ~92% for the three material types (oxide, transitional, and fresh ore).As drilling above highlights, the indicated portion of this resource which is higher-grade makes up a small subset of the overall resource base, and not only has drilling at Assafou yielded multiple thick high-grade intercepts like 30.9 at 3.90 grams per tonne of gold, 68.7 meters at 2.22 grams per tonne of gold, 27.4 meters at 5.21 grams per tonne of gold, and 18.0 meters at 13.82 grams per tonne of gold, but there are multiple targets within a close proximity to Assafou that could act as satellite pits. And early drilling at Pala Trend 2 and 3 located 4 kilometers southwest have yielded promising intercepts as well (11.0 meters at 9.7 grams per tonne of gold and 10.03 meters at 3.07 grams per tonne of gold). Meanwhile, at the Kongojdan target to the southeast, we've also seen high grades with an impressive intercept of 3.0 at 47.25 grams per tonne of gold. And as discussed in the Q2 2023 Conference Call:- Endeavour Mining, Q2 2023 Conference CallThis is very exciting, with geophysics suggesting that mineralization could continue well past Assafou with the potential for a much larger mineralized system than what's been outlined to date. And what it's certainly premature to discuss economics, I have presented a table below which looks at conceptual production profiles assuming a 92.5% recovery rate and production scenarios from 6.0 to 7.0 million tonnes per annum at varying feed grades, with these throughput rates being justifiable in my view if Endeavour could ultimately prove up a 100.0+ million tonne resource or 70.0+ million tonne reserve base within a 10-kilometer radius of a central mill. As we can see, a 7.0 million tonne per annum throughput rate at grades of 2.3 grams per tonne of gold (bullish case) could support a 450,000+ ounce production profile in the early years with elevated grades, while even lower throughput scenarios at more conservative grades (6.0 million tonnes per annum at 2.0 grams per tonne of gold) would translate to an impressive operation with similar scale to its top-3 assets, Ity, Hounde, and Sabodala-Massawa.As noted by Endeavour, we should see an updated resource at Tanda-Iguela by year-end and if this follows a similar course to Lafigue, we could see this asset in production well before the end of the decade. To be clear, I do not expect to see a 100.0+ million tonne resource outlined in the upcoming resource which would be a doubling of the previous resource, but I would not be surprised to see a resource of this size delineated by year-end 2025. And if achieved, this could be Endeavour's next mine with an ultra-low discovery cost, supporting the view that Endeavour does not need M&A to grow its production profile, it just needs its massive portfolio of highly prospective ground, its talent exploration team led by Jono Lawrence (former Exploration Manager at Randgold), and its strong balance sheet, which supports ramping up exploration aggressively when it hooks a potential monster like it has at Tanda-Iguela.Endeavour Mining's Q2 results have appeared mediocre on the surface, but the portfolio looks better than ever, it's been optimized to enjoy even higher margins post-2023, and its growth projects are progressing well and on schedule, supported by Endeavour's nearly $1.0 billion in available liquidity. Meanwhile, its exploration success continues to look promising, with underground potential confirmed at Hounde, and a very impressive new discovery being outlined at Tanda-Iguela. Given the company's industry-leading margin profile, attractive valuation (~5.0x FY2024 cash flow per share estimates), and consistent leading returns to shareholders (~$120 million in share repurchases over the past 18 months), I would view any pullbacks below US$20.50 as buying opportunities.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Forvia SE (FURCF) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Forvia SE () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2023 2:00 AM ETOlivier Durand - Executive Vice-President and Group Chief Financial OfficerChristoph Laskawi - Deutsche BankSanjay Bhagwani - CitiJosé Asumendi - JPMorganThomas Besson - Kepler CheuvreuxGiulio Pescatore - BNP Paribas ExaneStephen Reitman - Societe GeneraleThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the presentation of the FORVIA results of Q3 2023. The key message that we would like to convey this morning is, first of all, on the activity, strong organic growth in a market that continues to grow. We have – we are posting €6.5 billion of revenues, 10.7% increase on an organic basis, which is a 7% outperformance on the market growing by 3.7% on the auto production volume.On the commercial side also, we continue to have a strong order intake, €22 billion in the first nine months, and therefore, our book-to-bill continues to be above one. And it includes improvements on the upfront aspect, which means that it is helping the improvement of the net cash flow on a going-forward basis.The third message is related to disposals. So first of all, as you have seen, we have completed the €1 billion disposal program that we committed in Q2 of last year. We did it through 5 transactions, and we did it with the amount of €1 billion in cash proceeds, and we did it in 15 months.In the context of this activity, we identified further possibilities to go beyond this €1 billion and considering the evolution of interest rates and the level that remains high and will probably remain high for a while. We consider necessary to go further. So we have decided to launch a new €1 billion asset disposal program toThis means that we will go beyond the POWER25 objective of 1.5x net debt to EBITDA by the end of ‘25. The first transaction has been already signed. We – as we announced at the beginning of thisLast but not least, we, of course, confirm our guidance for ‘23. Apart from those elements, we would like to highlight 2 key elements. We continue on the road to sustainability, and we are getting more material and more real in this domain. We have just opened our sites for hydrogen production in France. This will be the first mass production plant of storage tanks with a capacity of 100,000 units per year by 2030.We are becoming, therefore, the first automotive supplier in the world to have production footprint across the major regions. And you will see in Q4 also that we are moving also on other aspects of the sustainability with the formal opening of our material activity in Lyon that will be November, and with the opening of the plant of Symbio, which is about stack in hydrogen, which is the joint venture. We have now with Michelin and Stellantis. So the role for sustainability and supporting the transition of this industry, we are contributing and we are getting extremely material in this respect.The second aspect is the diversification in China. As you know, we are quite strong across the board and in particular with BYD, but we are expanding, in fact, our collaboration with others, and we would like to highlight, in particular, the strategic cooperation we have signed with CHERY on smart cockpit development.On the order intake, so €22 billion, and we would like through this slide to present in fact, where we are getting orders. So of course, China, of course, electronics. But I would like to highlight that now we are getting to 50% of our order intake in electric vehicles, whether it’s fuel cells or BEVs. And we continue to expand on premium, of course. And we had a significant conquest on commercial vehicle for Seating of €1.7 billion in inside. So clearly, we are on the different dimension in the good direction.And in terms of the contents and the financial metrics of those orders, the selectivity that we have defined is paying off. We have a margin that is above our POWER25, ‘25 objectives. And we have upfronts that are – the upfront being the cash investment, you have to do at the beginning of the project before actual production down 20% year-on-year in those nine months. So the quality of the order intake is there.Now if I focus on the sales activity of Q3 for FORVIA. So as mentioned, strong organic growth, 10.7%, €6.5 billion of revenues and a reported basis of 2.5%, taking into account the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the run in the period. As you may remember, U.S. dollar was particularly strong in Q3 of last year, close to parity at some point. So therefore, this evolution.We have solid outperformance, and you will see this outperformance is across business group and across regions. And I would like to highlight also that the evolution of the car market remains positive in Q3 with the latest assessment and assessment upwards of S&P for the worldwide production.If I go in some more details by business group first. So you see that Seating and Interiors have, in fact, an outperformance quite similar at 7 – and respectively, at 760 basis points and 730 basis points, which is reflecting the breadth of the activity there. One element, of course, to highlight is that this quarter represents the effective end of our just-in-time operations for the Seating program, Jeep Grand Wagoneer in agreements with Stellantis. And you, of course, remember that it was a cause of severe losses in the past period. So this case is closed.Regarding Clean Mobility and Electronics. So Clean Mobility outperformance but lower than other ones, which is reflecting. Of course, the developments of the electrification of the car industry, but the fact that we continue to grow and grow above the market is quite positive.One more element to mention. You see that, in fact, the currency effects in this activity is higher than other ones. This is the manifest of, in fact, the most distribution of Clean Mobility across the regions. This activity is the most balanced in terms of revenues across geographies, which is actually a good thing because electrification is happening at different phase in the different regions. So it’s allowed to mitigate some of these elements.Electronics, we have a growth of 10.6% on an organic basis, 690 basis points around the average inside FORVIA. Lighting, similar to other business group you have seen before, 10.8% organic growth, 710 bps outperformance. So you see the 710 bps outperformance being the main driver in all the activities. Lifecycle reflecting, in fact, the increased contribution from the truck and the bus segment, also the pass-through of inflation, leading to a 16.1% increase on an organic basis of this activity, which is, of course, quite contributive on the profitability front and has a good cash cycle.If I move from a regional point of view, you see the overall picture at the group level. But if we look at the different markets, I will start with Asia. Asia growing in Q3, 1.7% on the volume of the market and for us, a 12.1% organic growth, which means that this is the highest outperformance we have similarly to previous quarters, which is reflecting the strength and the distributed activity we have, particularly in China, which is not only about BYD, but it’s also about the other OEMs.On the other regions, you see that we have an outperformance 490 basis points in Europe and 160 basis points in Americas, which is reflecting also a bit more selectivity that we have in this region, in particular in North America, and of course, to have the minimum activity in Argentina.Moving on to the key disturbance we have in this period, and the key risk is about the UAW strike. So some key figures about this. What is our exposure to the strike? First of all, we are not directly involved. We are not – we have closed our negotiation with UAW. So we have no outstanding negotiations for this year on the labor conditions and compensations. We will have 2 for renewals next year, but this is next year.Of course, the strike is impacting us. So far, it has been fairly moderate. You see that our exposure is around €300 million per month. If all activity in North America will stop with Ford, GM and Stellantis. However, so far, this has been quite lower, only €6 million sales impact in September so – and €1 million in margin. In October, around €55 million to €60 million at the current strike level, including the latest announcement of last week of UAW.And we are putting in place all the actions necessary to mitigate the impact on us about flexibilization of the cost, temporary layoffs, reduction of the purchase and the discretionary spending. So we expect to limit the drop-through to 20% on those revenues, which is so far, as I mentioned, around €60 million in sales, but it’s a key watch item on which we are focused to ensure minimum impact on our performance.Now if I move to the second topic of this morning is about deleveraging. So we are accelerating and amplifying in fact, our actions in this domain. Number one, we fully closed and completed our first €1 billion asset disposal program. We did it in 15 months, five different operations, all with industrial partners. And we had a limited impact on the – on our financials, lower in revenues. That’s what we expected initially. And in terms of cash proceeds, we completed the €1 billion target.In the context of this activity, we have identified, of course, larger possibilities. Since the beginning, the portfolio was larger than the €1 billion, obviously, but we have identified other possibilities and considering the fact that interest rates remains at a high level and probably will remain so for a while.We consider necessary to go beyond our initial objective of 1.5x net debt EBITDA by the end of ‘25 as reported in the POWER25 plan. And we decided to launch an additional €1 billion cash proceed disposal program. This will be with different operations. There is not a single operation that will represent this €1 billion, is different formats and different operations. In many aspects, similar to the first one.The first operation has been already signed, which is the disposal of BHTC to AUO, a Taiwanese company. BHTC is a joint venture between HELLA and MAHLE. This has been signed on the 2nd of October. The enterprise value for 100% is €600 million. And in terms of cash proceeds for us and for MAHLE, it will be around €200 million considering the current level of debt. We expect the cash proceeds to arrive, in fact, in the first half of – at the beginning of ‘24, taking into account the antitrust proceedings.We, of course, confirm our guidance for ‘23. We are taking into account the new risk and large risk that represent the UAW strike, which is having a potential impact larger than what was imagined before. But we confirm all the metrics with revenue between €26.5 million and €27.5 billion for the year, operating margin between 5.2% and 6.2%, a net cash flow above 1.5x and the net debt to EBITDA leverage to be between 2.0x to 2.2x taking into account the cash flow performance and the disposals that I mentioned before of the first €1 billion disposal program.Regarding midterm objectives, we confirm the POWER25 objective. This – the €1 billion additional disposal that I just mentioned, will, of course, improve the metric on the net debt to EBITDA beyond the rate – beyond this ratio of 1.5x. The impact in terms of revenues is expected to be limited given the combination of type of operation we have in mind. And the impact on operating margin, in fact, should – in terms of ratio should be neutral. And in terms of cash flow, the reduction of financial expenses from this additional disposal with the reduction of the debt itself will, in fact, help the ratio of 4%.So in summary, Q3, that is solid. Order intake of a good quality. And we are taking action, considering on the activity side, the UAW strike. And on the financial side, the persistence of high interest rates to not only secure our numbers, but to go beyond in particular on our debt. So that, in fact, the level of financial expenses is going down more rapidly than what we imagined before and unsure progress on the financial structure of this company.And on this note, I’m ready for questions.We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Christoph Laskawi of Deutsche Bank.Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one would be on the outperformance and – the divisional outperformance and how we should think about that into Q4 and ‘24 as well. Could you just give a comment on should that largely be unchanged at the rate we’ve seen it? And which of the divisions actually has a lot of SOPs probably driving that even up further? Or are there any impacts we should be aware of?And then second question, please, on cash. I know this is a revenue call, but with the volatility in production, likely there’s still an impact on working capital as well. Could you comment on cash during Q3? And also, if you’ve seen any changes in payment terms from the OEMs so far? Thank you.Thank you. Good morning. So on outperformance, in the first half, we had an outperformance of 680 basis points. This quarter, we are at 700 bps. We expect a bit of moderation of this in Q4. And this is related, in fact, to the end of the Highland Park program, which is reducing this – the activity by around 1 point. And we have also, in fact, the end of the activity on commercial vehicle since we sold it to Cummins effective end of September.And the last one, we expect, in fact, an impact of the UAW on the production side, which can play. So a bit lower, in fact, in Q4. The other point, which is more for reported revenues, we do not expect the level of negative impact from currencies that we have seen in Q3, probably half of it, but you can see that directly with the level of activity we have in China and U.S.On cash, we – so we have to put volatility in perspective. We have been through a level of volatility and unannounced events that has been dramatic in the past, of course, some time ago to COVID, but even the shortages and the Stop & Gos. We have much less of this nowadays. So the only major Stop & Gos aspect is the UAW strike, which has been until, in fact, 10 days ago, limited but we are prepared for it. We have the mergers defined and we activate them according to the events.So I would say that this is not leading to an issue on working capital. The only caveat I would make is on inventories. We will have reduction of inventories during the year, but it’s more about protection of electronics supplies that is moderating this. But the environment overall is simpler to work wins that it has been clearly before.Now related to payments from customers, I do not notice anything particular to date. But we are making – collect our overdues. And I would say, for completeness, the fight on inflation remains a tense topic for – but it’s not a deterioration. It’s just the continuation of what we have seen for the past 18 months.Thank you.The next question is from Sanjay Bhagwani of Citi.Hello. Thank you very much for taking my question also. I have got two questions. Maybe the first one on the financing cost. Could you please provide some color of how should we think of, let’s say, the financing costs for this year and also probably for the next year? And let’s there are a few moving variables here, first thing is interest rates are staying high, but at the same time, I think your gross debt is also likely to go down.So maybe like blending all this and again, keeping in mind that one-third of your debt is variable – in variable cost debt. So what – how should the financing costs be for this year and for the next year? That is my first question.And my second question is on the announced additional disposal program. Could you please provide some color on this, the nature of the disposals, and also how should we think of the timing of this? Thank you very much.Thank you. So on the first question on the financial cost. So from a cash perspective, it will represent, as I mentioned before, between €450 million and €500 million for this year and probably next year will be similar.On the P&L, there is a bit more than this due to, in fact, hyperinflation in Turkey and Argentina and also mark-to-market on a virtual PPA operation. But the cash impact is around this. It will go down – it was anyway expected to go down in ‘25, given the reduction of gross debt to €6 billion. That is part of the POWER25 program. And it will be even more with the additional €1 billion disposal that we are announcing this morning.The costs of – the marginal cost of financing on a given operation today for us is between 5% and 7%, depending on instruments. So you can see what is the impact of this €1 billion in helping. That will be more in ‘25 than in ‘24. I think in ‘24, we will have benefit from the BHTC operation and potentially another one, which is a good segue.To your second question on the disposal program, you can expect the content to have some similarity with the first one, which is several operations, which is simplification of the portfolio, and which is also different timing for different operations. So we expect to realize the vast majority from a cash profit perspective by the end of ‘25. And so helping in fact, the net debt-to-EBITDA leverage.One more thing on this one, there is no single big operation inside this that will put in question the core businesses that we have in the company. So it’s really about continuation of simplification of the portfolio, management focused on the key elements, and when we can see good operations that can be done, that’s in fact, unsure that the level of gross debt is going down and going down faster than what we committed before, we do it.Thank you. That’s very helpful.The next question is from José Asumendi of JPMorgan.Good morning, Olivier. A couple of questions, please. I think the first one, are you accelerating the asset disposal plan because you’re seeing some kind of large deceleration in the market, which could impact the ability for FORVIA to generate cash? Or is this a plan that you’re doing because you’re confident in your car generation. But on top of this, you want to do the asset disposals. I just want to understand a little bit better this incremental asset disposal plan you put in on top.Second, can you give us a bit of the guidance for just for ‘24 a little bit the moving parts and this when it comes to the growth you’re seeing across different markets, Europe, U.S., China and outperformance of great place.And the final one, guidance. So we think, at this stage, with the strong pricing power you have in 2023, it should be – it would be possible to achieve the margin – in the upper end of the margin range of 5.2% to 6.2%. Thank you.Good morning, Jose. Thank you for the question in particular for the first one. This disposal program is about going further than what we said before. And we are doing it for two reasons. Number one, in the 15 months in which we have been working on disposal, we have identified larger possibilities, different type of operations. We have, I would say, also learned on the context how to go through this. So that’s the first reason. And the manifest of this is that we have an additional operation, which is the BHTC, which is already signed.The second reason is obviously that the level of interest rates, the level of inflation are high. I think it’s difficult to expect that it will get better in the near term. We don’t want to comment on this. We have the possibility to go further. So we are doing it. So it is an addition compared to the rest, is not a replacement and is not a key focus from the rest.On the guidance ‘24 and elements on the ‘24. So we will formally provide the guidance about ‘24 in February on the back of our full year results. Having said that, I would – in the current situation, I would expect, in fact, the overall auto production to be marginally up next year potentially on the back of additional growth in China. You see that in fact the production level and production activity in China remains solid and, in fact, better than what people expect.The revisions of S&P are usually positive on these aspect so marginal increase on the volume. We expect continuation of our outperformance. And in terms of profitability and cash flow, we are, in fact, expecting to deliver on the improvements on the back of synergies since we are doing only 40% of the synergies by the end of ‘23. So you have 60% to go between ‘24 and ‘25.Improvement of production outperformance. We still have difficulties in this front, and we are getting progressively better so you will see more impact in ‘24. The ends of the JIT operation of Highland Park, which was a drag still on our results in the first nine months. And I would say a mix that is quite positive both on the region and also on the product.On your question about ‘23. So we provided the guidance in July 5.2% to 6.2% that we confirm. Having said that, I think compared to last summer, the strike of the UAW is not helping. So to be on the high side of the range would mean that the strike is in fact concluding extremely fast. That China would be, in fact, on a very positive trend. So it means quite a bit of elements. So net-net, I see more topic than in July on the full year, mainly on the strike of UAW that was not the focus in July.Very clear. Thank you very much.[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Thomas Besson of Kepler Cheuvreux.Thank you. Good morning. It’s Thomas from Cheuvreux. I have a few questions as well, please. Could you update us on compensation and how that has effectively developed in the third quarter versus your expectations, notably on energy and wage costs.Second question, could you confirm the amount of losses implied still in Q3 by your Michigan operation that are now closed.And lastly, could you comment on the level of expected multiples for transactions you’re planning until ‘25? Looking at the fact that a lot of auto suppliers seem to be now lining up for selling assets. Thank you.Thank you, Thomas. On compensation, we are progressing. I would say that we are progressing, roughly speaking, as I expected. It means that we are closing some of the deals, but we are not fully done yet for the year. We are expecting to be with at least 85% cumulative pass-through by the end of the year. And this is realistic based on what we see, but it’s clearly an element of volatility and element of tension with the customers.We see that we have strong order intake that has good condition. We are able to do selectivity. It does not mean that it’s easy to have the balance between order intake and inflation recovery, but this is a necessity. This is an obligation for us. So we will deliver on this one, but it’s tough.On Michigan, the contract in Michigan, the loss in Q3 is marginal. So it’s not – there is nothing significant. So the losses that you have seen in H1 is really most of what we will have for Q3 and therefore, for the year.On disposal metrics, maybe I should say that the – in fact, the disposal will have different forms. And we expect some related to form of disposal of activities and some of it, in fact, in reduction of partnership. So to give an overall metric today would be inadequate. What we are counting on is in fact, to have a limited impact on the consolidated revenue €500 million to €700 million, €800 million of revenues. No real dilutive effects on the operating margin.And on the cash flow, I would say, net-net positive and maybe clearly positive, especially taking into account the reduction of financial cost that it will provide on the €1 billion cash proceeds. So a bit early. But I would say that we expect, in fact, to have operation of the type of the first wave. So once again, not a single dominant one, but several ones, a bit different in order to, in fact, do a combined portfolio of operation that is fair and good for the company. Difficult for me at this stage to provide more details without having [Technical Difficulty].Clear. Thank you very much.The next question comes from Giulio Pescatore of BNP Paribas Exane.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one on the guidance again. I mean, if I remember correctly, one of your assumptions for GLVP [ph] were based on a very cautious view on China. China, as you said, has been picking up quite strongly. So I was just wondering what keeps you cautious on – in this regard?Then the second one on order book. I mean you’re saying that the profitability of the order book is above the target. And it’s interesting because it’s something that we’re hitting a lot, not only from you but also from your competitors. And can you maybe help us understand how this is possible. And – I mean, the market clearly doesn’t believe that this is possible. But can you maybe help us frame how is it possible that you’re obtaining higher implied margins by the recent contracts?And maybe last one on labor costs. You said you have 2 negotiations with the UAW coming up. Do you think that the – any agreement that the Detroit Three will strike this year, will form a blueprint for you to start the negotiation next year? So should we expect significant inflation in North America for you? Thank you.Good morning. Thank you. On the guidance – on the volume of activity in China, we have been cautious and we remain so because the macroeconomic elements on China are on balance quite negative. Having said that, similar to what S&P has shown, the actual production level and the actual demand is so far better than what was anticipated. And S&P has improved its expectation for the year, I think, to close to 1 million cars in China.Now the vast majority is already in Q3. So it’s already in a way – in the numbers we are showing for Q3. So on balance on China, we remain cautious. And what we are doing is to make sure to leverage the diversity that we can have in China, diversity from a customer front. We are with 19 of the top 20 international or Chinese OEM in the country. We are developing relationship, for instance, with CHERY with this partnership on the smart cockpit this quarter. We are growing with Li Auto.So we are making sure to go beyond, in fact, some others and diversify, including from BYD. So we hope that China can be better, but we are making sure to benefit in any case from the diversity and selling probably better the product of HELLA in the country to Chinese OEM.On the order margin, I understand completely the question. Why we expect to have margin above, in fact, the 7% target we have for ‘25? Inside this, you have the impact of synergies. And you have the impact of cost reductions that we are putting in place to reduce our breakeven point. So this is what is driving the improvement.Having said that, for this to materialize in the results, clearly, we need to have an operational performance that is better than what it has been in the past, and we are taking the measures to make sure that it does. Some examples, so we stopped the Michigan contract because it was impossible for us to make money out of it. We are selective on some of the domains, including in electronics.And third, we are making sure the full implementation of our operational reference book, which is called FORVIA Excellence System, which is making sure that all the good practices to operate the plants are put in place, and we have an indicator to follow the full respect of this. And this indicator is growing and is growing in particular where it was weak, which is North America.And this is making a bit more confident about the realization of what we see in the order book. But I understand the comments, and this is, in fact, good to have this because it’s – it put in visibility what we have to do in front of us.On the last question you had, which is related to UAW. So once again, we have closed our labor negotiations for the year, and it was before the strike. So there is no relationship to the strike per se. We have 2 locations that are concerned for renewal in ‘24.Let’s see what is the outcome of the negotiations. And clearly, that will be part of the discussion. But once again, we are expecting inflation, including labor and some energy to remain a topic next year, and we are taking this into account, including in our productivity, which is digitalization and also location of our activity to make sure that we have the best cost possible, so development of Mexico, for instance.Thank you. And so you can just follow-up quickly on the order book. So it’s mostly – it’s not better pricing. It’s more driven by the fact that you’re want to be more efficient. But how do we make sure that – in the event of another spike in inflation or another change in the market environment, how do we make sure that the order book is priced correctly, has the right assumption behind it? I mean, are you changing the way you actually collect these orders?So since the beginning of the persistent inflation, we have changed the way we are calculating the margin of the orders. We are taking, in fact, the dilution effect of the inflation into account, which was 2, 3 years ago, probably not the case because it was not expected. So even when you – even if we were compensating the inflation at 100%, which, as you know, we are targeting, but we have to be honest, this is today not possible.But you have a dilution effect of 1 point. So this is clearly a factor, but this is now taken into account because we cannot count on the inflation to recede. So this is embarked in our calculation, which gives a bit more validity, in fact, to this – to those values.Understood. Thank you very much.The final question is from Stephen Reitman of Societe Generale.Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Not so much on earnings – not – I know it’s an earnings call, but just maybe to talk a little bit about China. I just come back from a visit to China. And obviously, seeing a lot of these new companies and the Chinese brands that you’re supplying as well. And obviously, the pricing on these vehicles is extraordinarily low when we compare them to European levels. So I was just wondering what you could say about the overall profitability of this kind of business? How you actually price in these markets? And how it kind of compares to operations in the rest of the world? Thank you.Yes. Thank you. You’re absolutely right. The – many of the cars that are proposed by the Chinese carmakers in particular, the new ones, are at price conditions that are selling prices that are quite attractive. There is probably an aspect which is related to the platform themselves on the electric cars because many of them are starting purely from electric so there is this aspect.But if we take more about our domains, which is more the interior and the lighting, we are making good margin in China, and actually, we are not the only supplier to make good margin in China. And it’s not because we have a pricing that is higher than other regions, as you can imagine. And I think it’s quite related in fact to the direct and pace at which decisions are made for a new car. And even though you have many companies, many carmakers in China, you have the diversity, the number of options on a given range of models is probably lower than in Europe.And what does it mean? It means that, in fact, the cost and the complexity to deliver the path that we have to the Chinese carmakers is much lower than some other more traditional customers. Meaning that we are able to have less cost, to have less cash out while making a margin that is actually a good one.So net-net, I would expect that some of this is clearly benefiting also the carmakers in China. Look at the number of options per car in China. I think it’s very different from what we see in Europe and is simplifying the work of everyone actually. Some similarity with Tesla is there.And on the pace of change as well because obviously, one of the key things we noticed is how quickly the Chinese are changing what seem to be very modern vehicles. They come out with another version very quickly much faster than it’s been the norm among the traditional legacy carmakers. What challenges that posed to you then?So it’s a very important factor. It means that in our pricing and in our cash condition, we are taking this into account. So we expect, in fact, a lifetime that is shorter than in other places. And the second thing is that we are quite focused on the diversification. Meaning to have activity with the different players because you are not sure about which ones will win. And second, you have to consider that there are probably too many players still in China. So we are making sure also that from a financial exposure, we manage the situation so that in case some of them will have difficulties and we had cases in the past. The impact for us is limited, and we have been quite successful in this matter with, in fact, carmakers leaving or stopping activity in China.So the challenge is really the number of players. And indeed, the fact that models are moving faster. We have been able to be double-digit margin for quite a while now. And I think we know the characteristic of the market, and we are able to benefit from it. And if anything, the merger with HELLA is allowing, in fact, to extend the reach for us by selling the HELLA products more to the Chinese carmakers, that was the case before the acquisition of HELLA by FORVIA.Thank you very much.Mr. Durand at this time, there are no more questions registered, sir.Thank you. So thank you for your attendance this morning. So as you can see, our trajectory is clear. We have solid growth. We have outperformance. We are progressing on our metrics, but we are taking into account also the risks that exists. One risk is about the activity in North America with the UAW strike, which is clearly impacting the – and putting an uncertainty on the level of activity with a potential shift between this quarter and the beginning of next year. So we have put in place all the actions to mitigate the follow-through of this.And the second, interest rates and inflation are here to stay. So we are taking this into account. We have seen that we are able to go beyond the €1 billion disposal that we initially committed and that’s why we are launching this one to reduce our debt, reduce our financial expenses beyond what we committed in POWER25 to ensure solid financial structure and the flexibility, whatever is the context for FORVIA, our company. Thank you very much.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining. The conference is now over, and you may disconnect your telephones.",0,2023-10-26T14:16:03.000-04:00
Centerra Gold Q2 Results: This Is Troubling,"This is an update on  (), a mid-tier gold and copper miner with operations in Canada and Turkey. The company operates two flagship mines, the Mount Milligan mineCenterra has been a sector underperformer, with its stock declining by -2.88% over the past year, trailing the VanEck Gold Miners Index () and the junior miners index (), which have returned 15% and 7.9%, respectively.I've long considered Centerra Gold shares a  due to the stock's extreme undervaluation compared to other mid-tier miners, andTherefore, I've decided to downgrade Centerra Gold Inc. stock to a HOLD, as I expand on my thinking below.In , Centerra Gold's Mount Milligan mine produced 41,119 ounces of gold, a 24% increase from the previous quarter, and 13.8 million pounds of copper. However, production during this period was hurt by lower-than-expected metal recoveries.Gold production costs in the second quarter 2023 were $1,255/oz, and AISC came in at $1,711/oz. Centerra said that the higher costs were largely driven by higher mining costs and a decrease in gold ounces sold. Full-year AISC are now expected to fall between $1,125-$1,175/oz, up from the previous estimate of $1,075-$1,125/oz.The company also had a partial month of production from the  in Turkey. It contributed 20,503 ounces of gold production after the mine was re-started following approval of an amended Environmental Impact Assessment (""EIA""), issued by the Turkish government.At Öksüt, full-year gold production guidance is expected to fall within the range of 180,000 to 190,000 ounces, despite having just re-started its operations. The production levels at Öksüt are projected to keep rising in the latter half of 2023, with roughly 45% and 55% of its gold production expected in Q3 and Q4.However, despite the positive developments at Öksüt, this was a really weak quarter due to the underperformance of Mt. Milligan, and Centerra's worsened cash cost guidance.The company  a net loss of nearly $40 million, or -$.18 per share, and it only produced $33.4 million of cash flow, even with elevated commodity prices.The biggest issue I have with the company here is the performance of its Mt. Milligan operations and its continued decline.While this is still a profitable operation, things appear to be getting worse at the mine. Copper recoveries, for example, have declined for four straight quarters, while gold recoveries have declined from 68.8% to 65.5%.For 2023, guidance now calls for production to decline to 160-170,000oz of gold and between 60-70,000Mlb of copper, down from 189,000oz of gold and 74Mlb of copper in the prior year.Although production guidance is unchanged, Centerra noted that it now expects Mt. Milligan production to fall on the lower end of this guidance for 2023.Investors should be aware of the Mount Milligan Mine's obligation to sell 35% of its gold and 18.75% of its copper production to Royal Gold (). In return, Centerra receives $435 per ounce of gold and 15% of the spot copper price, which can affect the mine's bottom line. While this stream provided Centerra with an upfront cash infusion, it's definitely impacting the mine's profitability.Currently, Centerra Gold's strongest asset is its robust . The company has a substantial cash reserve of $401 million, along with an additional $398 million available from its credit facility. And it has no outstanding debt.Nevertheless, Centerra's operational performance presents a considerable risk for investors. Specifically, the Mount Milligan operations are consistently underperforming, and there are no immediate indications of improvement.While the Öksüt mine has resumed production, and Centerra has the potential to gain revenue from its molybdenum business, I believe the company's shares still carry significant risk.Furthermore, Centerra's financial obligations - including its dividend payouts, share repurchase program, and the advancement of its Goldfield project - suggest potential future capital constraints. It's possible we'll see Centerra's $400 million cash balance dwindle over the next year as a result.So, I recommend Centerra Gold Inc. shares as a , and I will revisit the stock next quarter.Join the exclusive community of smart investors who trust  for expert analysis on all commodity stocks!

Enerplus: Projected To Generate Over $250 Million In H2 2023 Free Cash Flow,"Enerplus Corporation () looks capable of generating over $250 million in free cash flow in 2H 2023 at current strip prices. Much of this free cash flow is expected to go towards .In the longer-term, Enerplus is focusingI now estimate Enerplus's value at approximately $17 per share at long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. I  that it is roughly fairly priced at the moment. its 2023 production expectations, boosting the midpoint of its liquids production guidance by 2% and the midpoint of its total production guidance by 1%.Enerplus now expects to average approximately 96,500 BOEPD in total production during 2023, including 60,000 barrels per day in liquids production.Enerplus's liquids production is expected to increase noticeably in 2H 2023, with liquids production potentially around 62,500 barrels per day, nearly 10% higher than 1H 2023 levels.Meanwhile, Enerplus's natural gas production is declining, due to limited investment in the Marcellus amidst weaker natural gas prices. Enerplus only put $15 million of its $510 million to $550 million capex budget for 2023 towards the Marcellus.Thus Enerplus may have roughly flat average daily total production in 2H 2023 compared to 1H 2023, but its liquids percentage is projected to rise from 59% in 1H 2023 to 65% in 2H 2023.As noted above, Enerplus's 2H 2023 production is expected to be near 96,500 BOEPD, with liquids making up 65% of that production. Based on recent results, the full breakdown may be approximately 53% oil, 12% NGLs and 35% natural gas.At current strip prices for 2H 2023 (including high-$70s WTI oil), Enerplus is projected to generate $869 million in revenues, including $18 million in positive hedge value.Due to the increased liquids-weighting and higher planned workover activity, Enerplus expects its operating expenses to be higher in the second half of 2023. It may average close to $12 per BOE in operating expenses in 2H 2023, compared to $10.40 per BOE in 1H 2023.Enerplus is thus projected to generate $256 million in free cash flow in 2H 2023 at current strip prices. Enerplus's capex budget was more heavily weighted to the first half of the year, with 60% of its full-year spending taking place in 1H 2023.Enerplus is planning on returning 60+% of its 2H 2023 free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Enerplus's current quarterly dividend is $0.06 per share, which adds up to approximately $25 million over two quarters.This would leave at least $129 million for share repurchases in 2H 2023, potentially enabling Enerplus to repurchase 7.7 million shares (at an average price equivalent to its current share price). Enerplus may end 2023 with around 204 million outstanding shares and net debt of under $100 million.Enerplus is aiming to generate 3% to 5% liquids growth per year with a $500 million to $550 million capital expenditure budget. This would allow it to generate around $450 million in free cash flow (before income taxes) at my long-term commodity price estimates of $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas.I estimate Enerplus's value at approximately $17 per share at those long-term commodity prices. Enerplus's free cash flow yield (while generating a modest amount of liquids production growth) would be around 13% before income taxes in that scenario.Enerplus should be able to end 2023 with a minimal amount of net debt (under $100 million) if it puts 60% of its 2H 2023 free cash flow towards share repurchases and dividends. In that scenario, Enerplus may also be able to reduce its share count to around 204 million by the end of the year.At long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas commodity prices, Enerplus would be able to generate over $2.20 per share in free cash flow in 2024. This would continue to increase over time (at those fixed commodity prices) as Enerplus grows its liquids production and repurchases shares.At the moment, I believe that Enerplus is close to fairly priced (with an estimated value of $17) for a long-term $75 oil and $3.75 gas scenario though.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Chevron to buy Hess in $53B deal to boost production and free cash flow,"Chevron () inked an  on Monday to acquire Hess () in an all-stock transaction valued at $53B, or $171 per share.The transaction price represents a 10.3% premium on a 20-day average based on October 20, 2023 stock prices.Hess shareholders will receive 1.0250 shares of Chevron for each Hess share. Chevron will issue about 317M in common stock.The transaction has a total enterprise value of $60B, which includes net debt and non-controlling interest, and has been approved by both companies' Boards of Directors and is expected to close in the first half of 2024. Chevron's acquisition of Hess enhances its portfolio, adding the Stabroek block in Guyana and Bakken assets to its DJ and Permian basin operations.The combined company is expected to grow production and free cash flow faster and for longer than Chevron’s current five-year guidance.In addition, CEO John Hess is expected to join Chevron’s Board of Directors.“Building on our track record of successful transactions, the addition of Hess is expected to extend further Chevron’s free cash flow growth,” said Pierre Breber, Chevron’s CFO, in a press release. “With greater confidence in projected long-term cash generation, Chevron intends to return more cash to shareholders with higher dividend per share growth and higher share repurchases.”The transaction is expected to achieve run-rate cost synergies around $1B before tax within a year of closing.The announcement comes less than two weeks after Exxon Mobil ()  a $60B acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources ().CVX and HES stock prices moved in opposite directions following the merger announcement, with CVX  and HES rising .

Vital Energy says Q3 production topped company guidance,"Vital Energy () said Wednesday its  averaged 101.3K boe/day, above company guidance of 94K-98K boe/day, with oil production of 48.7K bbl/day, also topping guidance of 45.5K-48.5K bbl/day.The company said results were driven mostly by the outperformance of recently turned in-line wells on the Driftwood and Forge acquisitions and in Howard County, Texas.Q3 incurred capital spending totaled $162M, excluding non-budgeted acquisitions and leasehold expenditures, below company guidance of $165M-$180M.",16,2023-10-11T16:47:40.000-04:00
Battalion Oil: Facing Substantial Debt Challenges,"Battalion Oil () recently reported  after a delay attributed to its former CFO suddenly leaving the company in early August. Battalion's recent wells have performed solidly and it should see substantial cost savingsBattalion is hampered by high interest and preferred dividend costs along with hedges that are below strip prices. It also has limited liquidity and is required to make regular payments to pay down its term loan. This has resulted in plans to raise up to another $38 million from issuing preferred equity.Battalion's limited liquidity is likely to prevent itAs a result, the value of Battalion's common shares is likely to be eroded by interest costs and the increasing liquidation preference on its preferred shares.Kristen McWatters was appointed as Battalion's CFO in January 2023 after Kevin Andrews decided to leave to pursue other opportunities. After just over six months, McWatters  (apparently with limited notice) that she would resign to pursue other opportunities.CEO Matthew Steele has taken over McWatters's financial supervisory responsibilities for now, but the sudden change led to Battalion's Q2 2023 report .Steele only became CEO of Battalion in April 2023 after Richard Little resigned. This high level of management turnover is indicative of a company that is in quite a challenging position.Battalion's Q2 2023 production ended up averaging 14,253 BOEPD (49% oil). This was down significantly from its average production of 16,200 BOEPD (50% oil) in Q1 2023. Battalion's total daily production declined by 12% quarter-over-quarter, while its daily oil production declined by 14% quarter-over-quarter.This significant decline was attributed to natural well declines as Battalion brought online four net wells in Q4 2022 (making Q1 2023 the first full quarter of production from those wells) and one net well in Q1 2023, but no new wells in Q2 2023.Due to liquidity constraints, Battalion does not appear capable of drilling more wells in the near-term. I have thus modeled its 2H 2023 production at approximately 13,050 BOEPD (48% to 49% oil), assuming that its production continues to decline, albeit at a slower rate of decline than from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023.At current high-$70s WTI strip, Battalion is projected to generate $111 million in oil and gas revenues before hedges, while its hedges have negative $10 million in estimated value.If Battalion's production declines as modeled here, it will have around 96% of its 2H 2023 oil production hedged at $67.36 per barrel, contributing to those hedging losses.Battalion is thus projected to generate $14 million in free cash flow over the second half of 2023. This assumes minimal capex and that its cash G&A costs are reduced to $5 million in the second half of the year as a result of its April workforce reductions.I have also assumed that the acid gas injection facility doesn't meaningfully reduce gathering and other costs during 2023. That facility was previously expected to be ""mechanically complete in early April"", reducing gas treating costs significantly during 2023. However, Battalion's Q2 2023 report now indicates that the facility would be online by the end of 2023.Battalion had $19 million in cash on hand at the end of Q2 2023. Battalion's projected free cash flow in 2H 2023 adds $14 million, but Battalion also has $20 million in term loan payments due in 2H 2023. With the net proceeds from its preferred equity offering, it would end 2023 with approximately $50 million in cash on hand, assuming there are no working capital changes.Battalion's accounts payable and accrued liabilities exceed its net accounts receivable by $25 million, so there is a decent chance that working capital changes reduce its cash on hand.Assuming that development capex continues to be minimal, I have modeled Battalion's 2024 production at approximately 11,400 BOEPD (48% oil).At the current strip for 2024, Battalion would generate $191 million in oil and gas revenues, while its hedges have negative $22 million in estimated value. In this scenario, Battalion would have 90% of its 2024 oil production hedged at a WTI price of $63.69 per barrel.I've assumed that Battalion's acid gas injection facility is fully operational during 2024, leading to significant savings for its gathering and other expense category.Battalion could thus generate $32 million in free cash flow during 2024. As noted before, it was projected to end 2023 with $50 million in cash on hand before working capital changes.However, Battalion is also required to make $50 million in term loan payments in 2024, so it would then end 2024 with $32 million in cash on hand before any working capital changes.At the end of 2024, Battalion is projected to have $32 million in cash on hand (before working capital changes) along with $150 million in remaining term loan debt.With the 16% PIK interest rate on its preferred shares, the liquidation preference on those share will increase relatively quickly. The liquidation preference on the preferred shares was $26 million at the end of Q2 2023. This is expected to end up at $65 million at the end of Q3 2023 if the agreement for an additional $38 million in preferred shares closes by the end of the quarter.The PIK interest would then increase the liquidation preference for its preferred shares to $79.1 million by the end of 2024.At the end of 2024, there would thus be $143 million in net debt (including the working capital deficit) and $79 million in preferred shares ranking ahead of the common shares.This combined $222 million total may be around 3.2x Battalion's EBITDAX at $75 WTI oil and Battalion's 2024 exit rate production. Without further development, Battalion's 2024 exit rate production may be around 10,500 BOEPD.Battalion appears to be largely stuck in a difficult position right now. It is required to make regular payments on its term loan (including $20 million in 2H 2023 and $50 million in 2024). This has resulted in it needing to issue more preferred shares to maintain some liquidity.These preferred shares have a high PIK interest rate of 16%, which starts eating into the value that is left for the common equity. The acid gas injection facility should help reduce Battalion's costs once it is fully operational, but it doesn't appear that Battalion has the financial ability to do additional development.Battalion is projected to have $222 million in net debt and preferred shares ranking ahead of the common shares at the end of 2024. This compares to $252 million in net debt and preferred shares at the end of Q2 2023.This is a 12% reduction in net debt and preferred shares, but Battalion's production is projected to decline by around 24% over the same period. Thus there may be quite limited value left for Battalion's common shares in the end, while its hedges prevent it from benefiting much (without additional development) from any major rise in commodity prices.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

Fortuna Silver: Another Quarter Of Margin Compression,"It's been a mixed Q2 Earnings Season so far for the Gold Juniors Index () and while there have been a few disappointments such as those from  () and Fortuna Silver (""Fortuna"") released its Q2 results earlier this month, reporting quarterly production of ~64,300 ounces of gold and ~1.26 million ounces of silver, translating to a 4% increase in gold production, offset by a 24% decline in silver production. The increase in gold production was driven by an initial contribution from its new Seguela Mine in Cote d'Ivoire (~4,000 ounces), while gold production from its legacy assets was down marginally in the period. The dip in gold output was related to a softer quarter at its Lindero Mine (lower grades in line with mine sequencing), fewer gold ounces produced at San Jose after a temporary blockade (lower throughput and limited access to high-grade stopes), offset by a better quarter at Yaramoko despite underground access being impeded by a failure of the Armtec tunneling structure at the portal. As for silver production, San Jose saw a sharp decline in throughput and grades related to the blockade discussed earlier.Fortunately, the blockade by the workers' union has since been resolved, but the company did note that it saw resignations of personnel following the resolution and higher absenteeism. And while access to planned higher-grade stopes will be available in Q3 to drive a better performance, a one-time payment of $2.8 million was made related to the new labor agreement. The result was that costs soared to $24.07/oz in the period (Q2 2022: $15.41/oz) despite lower sustaining capital, leaving the mine with an AISC margin of $0.02/oz for the period, down from $7.15/oz in Q2 2022 despite a higher average realized silver price. And while not much of a contributor, its Caylloma Mine in Peru didn't fare much better, with razor-thin AISC margins of $4.95/oz affected by inflationary pressures and weaker base metals prices.While the minor hiccup here isn't a big deal as San Jose has seen declining for years, it will lead to cost guidance being above the prior guidance range. And unfortunately at the company's new mine, we've seen some minor hiccups as well, with Seguela expected to be at the lower end of its production guidance range of 60,000 to 75,000 ounces in FY2023. As noted by the company, initial feed for commissioning was primarily oxide ore from the upper 10 meters at the Antenna Pit, but that section appeared to have been ""heavily depleted"" due to artisanal mining activities, with grades coming in lower than expected. The company also noted that .In addition to this setback, the mine experienced a failure of the primary transformer for the SAG Mill that resulted in a nine day shutdown and vendors needed to be brought in to help with repairs with modifications put in place to prevent any future issues. This should impact planned Q3 production levels even if the operation is now running more smoothly at nameplate capacity of 154 tonnes per hour. Overall, this isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things and Seguela should have a strong FY2024 once better grades are hitting the mill and it ramps up to commercial production. Still, with Lindero's costs tracking to the high end, Seguela's output tracking to the low end and San Jose's costs tracking to the high end, this was certainly a disappointing quarter.Finally, at the company's legacy gold operations (Lindero and Yaramoko), the two assets combined for production of ~54,400 ounces, with Yaramoko's output up year-over-year on the back of higher grades and throughput (~144,200 tonnes at 6.5 grams per tonne of gold). However, costs at these assets remain elevated, with increased sustaining capital resulting in all-in sustaining costs of $1,688/oz at Lindero (Phase 2 heap-leach expansion, capitalized stripping) and $1,626/oz at Yaramoko (increased underground development). And while these costs will normalize, this translated to consolidated AISC of $1,799/oz for the company, a massive increase vs. $1,434/oz last year, resulting in razor-thin AISC margins on a gold-equivalent basis of ~9% ($175/oz).Moving over to the company's revenue, Fortuna reported a sharp decline in revenue to $158.4 million (down over 5% year-over-year) despite the benefit of higher realized prices. This was related to fewer ounces sold than produced in its gold segment and lower production levels for silver. The result was that operating cash flow sunk to $44.2 million (down 7% year-over-year), while we saw a free outflow of $16.3 million, down from a cash outflow of $6.2 million in the year-ago period. The good news is that these figures should improve with Seguela construction complete and it expected to be a solid free cash flow generator. However, while a return to free cash flow positive is welcome, I continue to be luke-warm on Fortuna's position as a silver producer with San Jose running low on reserves (and potentially dealing with higher profit sharing costs), and I don't see any way that the company will retrieve its previous multiple as a high-cost (consolidated basis) predominantly West African gold producer.Some investors will note that Fortuna is trading at an attractive valuation, with the company capable of generating up to $200 million in free cash flow next year if metals prices cooperate. And while this is a very reasonable valuation for a company with an enterprise value of ~$1.15 billion (~6x EV/FCF), it's worth noting that other producers with higher margins, more impressive operations and exposure to Tier-1 jurisdictions (unlike FSM) are trading at similarly attractive valuations.One example is like B2Gold () which trades at just ~5.0x FY2025 EV/FCF estimates of ~$700 million with larger scale (~1.1 million ounces per annum), much lower costs (~$1,025/oz vs. FSM above $1,450/oz per GEO) and a team with a superior track record of creating shareholder value. So, while FSM may be getting more reasonably valued, I continue to see better relative value elsewhere, especially when we factor in that Goose could be a ~400,000-ounce operation at sub $900/oz costs long-term with permitted capacity of ~6,000 tonnes per day and the possibility of high-grade satellite operations (like George) to feed its plant.Unfortunately, while gold and silver prices were a tailwind in Q2 to make Fortuna's disappointing results look less bad, they have done little to since July. In fact, the average quarter-to-date price for gold and silver are sitting at $1,930/oz and $23.20/oz, respectively, down over 2% and 4% from their average prices in Q2. Simultaneously, the Mexican Peso strengthened substantially to start Q3 and has held onto most of its gains, suggesting another tough quarter from a cost standpoint ahead at San Jose, especially when combined with what appears to be a less favorable labor situation (resignations, absenteeism). So, while miners with operations outside of Mexico could see softer margins in Q3 related to weaker metals prices if the trend doesn't reverse soon, it will affect Fortuna more than the average company because of the unfavorable MXN/USD exchange rate.The other recent development worth noting is that the security has not improved in Burkina Faso, and one West African miner that is certainly open to operating in riskier jurisdictions decided to divest two of its mines last month (Boungou and Wahgnion). And while Fortuna only has one operating mine in Burkina Faso (Yaramoko), this negative sentiment surrounding West African producers has weighed on the share prices of several companies, including Orezone (), Endeavour Mining (), and Perseus Mining (). Although this has fortunately not affected operations, it doesn't help that a second jurisdiction of Fortuna's is seeing increased uncertainty, and this time one where it's heavily concentrated after its pivot to becoming predominantly a West African gold producer (~50% of FY2024 revenue coming from West Africa + a new development asset in West Africa).So, with Mexico and Africa being less in favor from an investment standpoint than last year with elevated uncertainty, it's possible that we could see discount rates higher and downside pressure on FSM continue.Using what I believe to be more conservative multiples of 5.0x forward cash flow and 0.90x P/NAV and a 65/35% weighting (P/NAV vs. P/CF), I see a fair value for Fortuna of US$4.30. Although fair value estimate points to a 43% upside from current levels, I am looking for a minimum 40% discount to fair value to ensure an adequate margin of safety for small-cap producers that operate out of non-Tier 1 ranked jurisdictions. After applying this required discount to Fortuna to determine its low-risk buy zone, its ideal buy zone comes in at US$2.60 or lower, suggesting there is still not enough of a margin of safety in place. And while the stock could bottom here and I could be wrong, I prefer to pay the right price or pass entirely, especially when there are better deals in safer jurisdictions elsewhere in the sector.Some investors might argue that there's a substantial upside for Fortuna Silver here and that it has traded at much higher multiples in the past. While true, its cost profile is far different (much higher costs even with Seguela), its silver reserves are shrinking, and it's transformed from a Lat Am precious metals with a significant portion of revenue from silver to a West African gold producer with only moderate (and dwindling) silver exposure. And if we compare Fortuna's multiples with higher-margin peers like Endeavour Mining and Perseus Mining which also trade at less than 5x forward cash flow, I don't see that much of a valuation disconnect here, especially with sentiment worsening for African producers recently. To summarize, I remain focused elsewhere for the time being, but I would become more interested if FSM were to dip below US$2.60 and filled its open gap.

"Coca-Cola: Debt Levels Reduced, Attractive Multiple, Upgrade From Hold To Buy","I last published an article on Coca-Cola Company () back on February 4, 2021, titled, """". I included in my summary points,Despite the potential for strong returns, I rated Coca-Cola a Hold at the time due mainly to my concern at the possible unsustainable increases in debt levels. Time to take another look.At the time of my 2021Pleasingly, Coca-Cola's debt net of cash as a percentage of net debt + equity has since decreased to 51.4% at the end of Q2-2023, just a little above the 50.5% at the end of 2016.Since my 2021 article, Coca-Cola has beat analysts' consensus EPS estimates for 10 of the 11 quarters reported and matched on the remaining one.Despite regular beats against analysts' EPS estimates, Coca-Cola's P/E multiple has decreased from 25.77 in February 2021 to the current reading of 20.44.Despite the lower current multiple, SA Premium analysis shows an increase of 8.54% in share price since the publication of my 2021 article and Total Return of 17.97% including dividends (note these percentages do not take into account duration held, so do not represent annualized returns, which would be lower).But for the decline in multiple, Coca-Cola would have provided strong returns since my previous article was published. The lower current multiple and the ability of Coca-Cola to meet or exceed analysts' EPS estimates, positions the stock to provide strong returns between now and holding through the end of 2025. The debt levels are no longer the concern they were previously. Taking all of the foregoing into account, I believe Coca-Cola stock presently deserves an upgrade from Hold to Buy. A more detailed financial analysis in support of this conclusion follows.What I'm primarily looking for here are instances of market mispricing of stocks due to distortions to many of the usual statistics used for screening stocks for buy/hold/sell decisions. I believe the answer is to compare projections, based on analysts' estimates out to the end of 2024 or later, to past performance. Summarized in Tables 1 and 2 below are the results of compiling and analyzing the data on this basis.Table 1 documents historical data from 2016 to 2022, including share prices, P/E ratios, EPS and DPS, and EPS and DPS growth rates. The table also includes estimates out to 2026 for share prices, P/E ratios, EPS and DPS, and EPS and DPS growth rates. (Note - while estimates are shown for analysts' EPS estimates out to 2023 to 2026 where available, estimates do tend to become less reliable, the further out the estimates go. These estimates are only considered sufficiently reliable if there are at least three analysts' contributing estimates for the year in question). Table 1 allows modeling for target total rates of return. In the case shown above, the target set for total rate of return is 7.5% per year through the end of 2025 (see line 12), based on buying at the October 6, 2023, closing share price level. As noted above, estimates become less reliable in the later years. I have decided to input a target return based on the 2025 year, which has EPS estimates from twelve analysts, because it allows for the impact of the projected EPS growth rates to be taken into account in the assessment of the value of Coca-Cola shares. The table shows to achieve the 7.5% return, the required average yearly share price growth rate from October 6, 2023 through December 31, 2025, is 3.82% (line 51). Dividends and dividend growth account for the balance of the target 7.5% total return.Table 2 below provides additional scenarios projecting potential returns based on select historical P/E ratios and analysts' consensus, low, and high EPS estimates per Seeking Alpha Premium through end of 2025.Table 2 provides comparative data for buying at closing share price on October 6, 2023, and holding through the end of years 2023 through 2026. There's a total of twelve valuation scenarios for each year, comprised of three EPS estimates (SA Premium analysts' consensus, low and high) across three different P/E ratio estimates, based on historical data, plus a fourth P/E ratio selected to provide an alternative scenario. Coca-Cola's P/E ratio is presently 20.44, which is below the historical average P/E ratio of 23.73. Table 2 shows potential returns from an investment in shares of the company across the range of P/E ratios This analysis, from hereon, assumes an investor buying Coca-Cola shares today would be prepared to hold through 2025, if necessary, to achieve their return objectives. Comments on contents of Table 2, for the period to 2025 column follow.All EPS estimates are based on analysts' consensus, low and high estimates per SA Premium. This is designed to provide a range of valuation estimates ranging from low to most likely, to high based on analysts' assessments. I could generate my own estimates, but these would likely fall within the same range and would not add to the value of the exercise. This is particularly so in respect of well-established businesses such as Coca-Cola. I believe the ""low"" estimates should be considered important. It's prudent to manage risk by knowing the potential worst-case scenarios from whatever cause.Line 18 shows the range between high and low EPS estimates. The wider the range, the greater disagreement there is between the most optimistic and the most pessimistic analysts, which tends to suggest greater uncertainty in the estimates. There are twelve analysts covering Coca-Cola through end of 2025. In my experience, a range of 2.8 percentage points difference in EPS growth estimates among analysts is low, and suggests a fairly high degree of certainty, and thus increased reliability.Lines 25, 35 and 45 show, at a range of historical P/E ratio levels, Coca-Cola is conservatively indicated to return between 0.1% and 3.5% average per year through the end of 2025. The 0.1% return is based on analysts' low EPS estimates and the 3.5% on their high EPS estimates, with a 2.2% return based on consensus estimates. Those are the lowest of the returns under the consensus, low and high EPS scenarios and assume a P/E multiple at 17.0, roughly in line with the sector average. At Coca-Cola's historical average P/E multiple of 23.73, the indicative returns range from 15.3% to 19.3%, with consensus 17.9%. If Coca-Cola's present multiple of 20.44 continued through 2025, returns ranging from 8.2% to 12.0% are indicated, with consensus 10.6%. Coca-Cola has been regularly beating analysts' estimates, causing analysts to increase their EPS estimates over time, as shown in Table 3 below.The increases in analysts' EPS estimates over time encourages me to believe Coca-Cola's multiple is likely to remain around or above the current level, at which levels double digit returns are indicated for holding through end of 2025.Over the 6.5 years end of 2016 to end of Q2-2023, Coca-Cola increased Net assets used in operations by $6,896 million. This $6,896 million increase was funded by a $3,945 million increase in debt net of cash, and a $2,951 million increase in shareholders' equity. Net debt as a percentage of net debt plus equity has increased slightly from 50.5% at end of 2016 to 51.4% at end of Q2-2023. Outstanding shares increased by 36.0 million from 4,288 million to 4,324 million, over the period, due to shares issued for stock compensation, partly offset by share repurchases. The $2,951 million increase in shareholders' equity over the last 6.5 years is analyzed in Table 4.2 below.I often find companies report earnings that should flow into and increase shareholders' equity. But often the increase in shareholders' equity does not materialize. Also, there can be distributions out of equity that do not benefit shareholders. Hence, the term ""leaky equity bucket."" I look for evidence of this in my analysis of changes in shareholders' equity. Coca-Cola's ""leaky equity bucket"" issues are towards the worst end of the spectrum.The current dividend yield is 3.35% and dividend yield on cost is projected to grow to 3.76% by end of 2025, underpinning potential returns. There also appears to be an opportunity for share price gains from EPS growth, which could be further magnified by multiple expansion. With a potential for double digit returns from buying now and holding through end of 2025, Coca-Cola is upgraded from Hold to Buy.

Accelerating Cash Flow Makes Marathon A Buy,"Shares of Marathon Oil () have been a mixed performer over the past year, trading marginally higher. As a company with significant cash flow sensitivity to the price of crude oil, the recent rally should be supportive of its results. Additionally, whileIn the company's , it earned $0.48 in adjusted EPS, slightly ahead of When oil is above $60, it targets a return of at least 40% of operating cash flow to shareholders, and from $40-60, it targets a return of 30%. The company's capex spending is capped by its maximum 5% annual production growth, so as oil gets past ~$80 its share buybacks can eclipse the 40% floor. Over the past twelve months, its share count has declined by 13% to 615 million, and in the seven quarters since initiating this program, its share count has fallen by 24%. Another $1.8 billion remains on its buyback authorization, enough to repurchase about 12% of the company.Targeting production growth of 0-5% may seem slow, but when the share count is falling by 10+%/year, the production per share is actually rising in the low teens. This can drive meaningful EPS growth over time, holding oil prices constant. Ultimately, it is per share growth, not company-wide growth, that we as investors should be focusing on. Additionally, given the large size of its buybacks, there is a benefit to the stock price being relatively low - it can buy back more of the company, increasing the accretive power of the repurchases. Because this capital return strategy appeals more to those seeking capital appreciation than those seeking income, MRO trades at a discount valuation to peers with a free cash flow yield of about 13%. While this valuation gap may not close immediately, over time, long-term investors will benefit from the compounding impact of share count declines.Now, while it has been able to repurchase shares aggressively in the past, investors will want to be sure it can sustain that going forward. First, we will look at its own operating results, which have been solid and within management's control, and then consider commodity prices, which are outside of its control.Marathon is on track to spend $2 billion on capex this year, with 60% of that spending happening in the first half. Oil production was 189,000 barrels per day, up 13% from last year and 1.5% sequentially. Its total production was 399,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, up 16% from last year and 1% sequentially. In Q3, oil production should rise sequentially to 195,000 barrels/day. Oil production has been coming in above expectations, thanks to solid well productivity, and should come towards the high-end of guidance, though growth will decelerate in Q4 as comps to last year become more challenging. Its two biggest plays are the Eagle Ford (about 40% of production) and the Bakken (about 27% of production), both well-performing US shale formations.Outside of US shale, Marathon has a unique and attractive asset: its stake in Equatorial Guinea's LNG export hub. Seaborne LNG has become a valuable commodity, with Europe becoming a significant buyer as it moves away from Russian gas. Importantly, Marathon will benefit from the expiration of fixed-price contracts for this asset's production next year, taking advantage of higher WTI and LNG pricing. With  trading toward $40 and WTI above $80, Equatorial Guinea's EBITDA could triple from 2023 to 2024 to about $1.5 billion. This stake led to a $249 million cash distribution in Q2, and we could begin to see further upside next year as higher prices flow through to results.MRO has also leaned down operations meaningfully to lower break-even costs. Capex spending is about $14 per barrel of oil. Operating costs are about $10, and there is another $10 in interest and G&A costs. As a consequence, the company has brought its free cash flow breakeven (after its dividend but assuming no share repurchases) down to about $40, creating significant resilience during downturns.Of course, today oil is well above $40, and it has been rising recently, as you can see below with WTI touching $90/barrel. While MRO has a resilient cost structure to last through downturns, I would not recommend shares to those who expect oil prices to fall meaningfully, as that will obviously reduce cash flow. If that is your view, I would not just avoid MRO - I would be inclined to avoid E&P companies as a sector, as no oil company wins from lower prices. However, I expect prices to at least remain around current levels, which leaves MRO shares in an attractive position.Russia and Saudi Arabia have  they will be extending their oil production cuts through year-end, which are keeping supply tight. There is still long-term uncertainty about Russian supply, given the war with Ukraine. And for all the focus on alternative energy, I would note the  (IEA) expects global oil demand to be about 5.5% higher in 2028 than it was in 2022. Primarily due to growth in EM, oil demand is still rising, but capital spending has been low in recent years due both to climate objectives in the West as well as companies like MRO having more discipline and choosing to buy back shares rather than grow production more quickly.Accordingly, while no one can know where commodity prices are going, I view them remaining in the $80-100 as more likely than falling to the $50-70 level. Now, in Q2, MRO realized $72.49/barrel of oil. With its production levels, each $1 move in crude oil is worth about $70 million to annual cash flow. Last quarter, MRO generated an annualized $2.1 billion in free cash flow for a 13% free cash flow yield. At $85, free cash flow will be $2.75-3 billion, with a further potential tailwind next year for incremental income from higher price realizations out of Equatorial Guinea.In terms of downside risks to my expectations, lower commodity prices are the primary risk. In particular, a global recession would reduce oil demand and lower prices. A resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict that enabled Russia to export gas to the EU again would also lower LNG prices and eliminate my expected tailwind from Equatorial Guinea. I do not expect a recession, and the resolution of Russia-Ukraine appears quite unlikely.There is also a risk that the efficacy of Marathon's capex program worsens, forcing it to invest more to maintain production, thereby reducing free cash flow. However, so far, the capex spending is leading to production toward the high end of guidance, so this does not appear to be a pressing risk. Finally, there is a risk that because of its buyback vs dividend focus, the valuation gap vs peers never closes, and it maintains a 13+% free cash flow yield. This would not cause the stock to drop - indeed it would still rise proportionately to its share count reduction - but it would mean that the upside is more limited, with shares unlikely to eclipse $30. While a macroeconomic downturn could cause shares downside, with its current discounted valuation, I believe investors are being well compensated for this risk.In the current oil environment, MRO has a free cash flow yield of closer to 18%, meaning we can see an even faster pace of buybacks and per share accretion. Given its oil-intensive production out of its US shale plays, MRO has significant gearing to the price of oil, and the market is looking past this cash flow yield given, in my view, its lower dividend yield.However over the next several quarters, as we see free cash flow rise considerably, leading to a faster pace of buybacks, due to higher crude oil realization and its LNG exposure, MRO should engender more focus. While it may still trade at a discount to the ~8% free cash yield of peers, a forward 12% free cash flow yield off $2.8 billion in free cash flow results in a share price of $38, offering nearly 40% upside, conservatively using today's share count. Investors should look to buy shares of MRO, a hidden gem with substantial cash flow and buyback capacity.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Kosmos Energy: The Underwater Underdog Rising,"When you think of oil stocks, big names like Exxon Mobil () or Chevron () probably pop into your head. They're everywhere with their global energy assets. And then there are giants like ConocoPhillips (Kosmos Energy is an independent E&P that  extracts oil and gas from offshore territories, notably the Atlantic Margins. Founded in 2003 with a keen vision to explore the largely untapped deep-water pockets of West Africa, the company quickly made a significant discovery by identifying the Jubilee field off the coast of Ghana in 2007. This discovery marked one of the most significant and promising oil finds of its time. In 2015, the company made another notable discovery - the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim field located in the deep sea around Mauritania and Senegal.In addition to these, Kosmos holds stakes in multiple endeavors in the US Gulf of Mexico and a pair of offshore projects in Equatorial Guinea. As of now, approximately 60% of its output stems from Ghana, with the US Gulf of Mexico accounting for just above a quarter (27% as of ), and the remainder flowing from Equatorial Guinea.It's evident, as seen in the chart provided, that like its counterparts, Kosmos Energy's financial performance has swayed with the ebbs and flows of oil prices. The company grappled with losses, most markedly in 2020, when oil prices took a nosedive, triggered by the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, with the resurgence of oil prices in 2021, marking Brent's ascent past the $60 per barrel threshold, Kosmos Energy's earnings displayed a commendable recovery.However, Kosmos Energy's financial footing still leaves room for improvement. The company remains saddled with a substantial debt load. While efforts have been initiated to pare down its overall debt, I believe there's a considerable journey ahead for the company to align itself with its industry peers.As the second quarter concluded, Kosmos Energy reported a debt of $2.41 billion against its cash reserves of $89.1 million. This puts the net debt at approximately $2.32 billion, a slight decrease from its recent peak at $2.50 billion as of the end of 2021. However, this is still quite high for a company valued at $3.3 billion and results in a notably high debt-to-equity ratio of 266%.In contrast, other stalwarts in the oil domain, such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and EOG Resources (), have adeptly leveraged the oil price surge to notably cut their debt burdens over the past couple of years. These companies, benefiting from robust profits and bountiful free cash flows, strategically channeled their excess cash to pare down debt. Currently, their debt-to-equity ratios, which are some of the lowest within the sector, range between a modest 15% to 35%.On closer inspection of Kosmos Energy's cash flow dynamics, the underlying issue becomes more evident. The company's track record in consistently amassing healthy free cash flows has been somewhat lackluster. For instance, during the first half of this year, the company witnessed an outflow (negative FCF) of $195 million as cash generated from operations fell short of covering total capital expenditures. Although 2022 saw a positive swing with free cash flows  to $343 million, the prior year (2021) logged a negative FCF of $98 million. Such periodic inconsistencies, in my view, have contributed significantly to keeping the company's debt levels elevated.It's crucial to recognize that Kosmos Energy's focus is on offshore projects. Historically, deepwater ventures are notably costlier to develop compared to their onshore equivalents. However, the upside is that once operational, these projects can yield consistent returns over extended periods without the need for significant additional capital investments.A notable observation is Kosmos Energy's hefty investments in offshore projects in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, the Gulf of Mexico, Mauritania, and Senegal. This investment strategy primarily explains their subdued free cash flows. Yet, in my view, the silver lining is that these projects are nearing their operational phase, and the timing couldn't be better.In Ghana, Kosmos has been channeling efforts into the Jubilee and TEN fields, which significantly contribute to its total oil and gas production. The company has a 38.6% stake in Jubilee and a 20.4% interest in TEN, with Tullow Oil () presiding as the chief operator in both areas. Significant capital has been infused into these regions by Kosmos and its partners to activate new oil wells and enhance production levels. The field reported a gross production of 82,700 bopd in Q2-2023. The commencement of Q3-2023 witnessed two new wells from the Jubilee South East development springing into action, which escalated gross production figures to 100,000 bopd in July. In the current quarter, one new producer well and two injector wells will also be placed into service, which should further augment production numbers.Kosmos projects a Q3 production range of 67,000 to 70,000 boe per day, indicating an 18% uptick from Q2 figures, primarily steered by the new Jubilee wells. However, as the newly operational wells in Q3 progressively reach their full production potential in Q4, I believe there's potential for volume to climb even further. It's plausible to predict levels exceeding 80,000 boe per day and potentially nearing 90,000 boe per day. Note that Kosmos Energy's projection for FY-2023 stands at an average of 67,000 boe per day. Based on this guidance, one could infer a Q4 production rate hovering around 83,000 boe per day.Consequently, I anticipate Kosmos Energy's Q4 oil and gas production to outpace Q1 figures by approximately 40%. This surge will invariably bolster the company's earnings and cash flows, and the positive trajectory could be further accentuated with prevailing robust oil prices.Oil prices have witnessed a notable surge recently, with both WTI and Brent futures soaring nearly 30% over the past three months, settling at $90.13 and $93.27, respectively at the time of this writing. This significant uptick stems from a blend of factors: supply curtailments from OPEC+, restrained output from US shale oil players, and a resilient demand primarily from Asia, among other pivotal regions.A pivotal announcement this month came from oil giants Saudi Arabia and Russia, two predominant OPEC+ producers. Both countries  their joint decision to roll over their collective production cuts of 1.3 million bpd until the close of 2023. Concurrently, Russia  a provisional embargo on diesel and gasoline exports, a move that may further constrict global supply. In contrast, the US has shown a more conservative growth trajectory in oil production. The shale oil producers have been emphasizing robust cash flow generation and healthy shareholder returns over aggressive production growth. Data sourced  US EIA pinpoints US field crude oil production averaging 12.8 million bpd in June, a marginal rise from January's 12.6 million bpd.Oil demand has remained resilient, even with the broader economic apprehensions. Post-COVID reopening from China, a foremost crude oil consumer, was anticipated to champion a potent economic resurgence. The economic momentum, however, fell short of expectations, prompting the nation towards stimulus interventions. Paradoxically, oil demand in China has held its ground. This resilience is evident in the robust crude oil import metrics and refinery throughput figures. China's crude oil imports in the previous month rose to 52.8 million metric tons, marking an upswing of nearly 21% from July and a significant 31% YoY growth. Concurrently, refinery throughput increased to an all-time high of 64.69 million metric tons, reflecting domestic refining industries' endeavors to cater to healthy local and international demand.In my view, the supply cuts from OPEC+, as well as lackluster growth from the US, might create a substantial supply shortage in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the estimates from the IEA and OPEC. With the onset of winter, the northern hemisphere is poised for a seasonal spike in oil consumption. Given this backdrop of tightening supply juxtaposed with surging demand, oil prices seem primed to sustain their elevated levels. This prevailing market climate augurs well for Kosmos Energy.I believe Kosmos Energy's finances will likely strengthen in the forthcoming months, and this optimism is founded on several tangible factors. Note that Kosmos Energy realized oil prices of $75.32 per barrel in the second quarter, but prices have since climbed to $90s a barrel range. With higher prices, coupled with burgeoning production rates, the company looks well-positioned to register significant growth in its earnings and cash flows.One crucial element to consider is the company's capital expenditure trajectory. Given the development stages and the completion timelines of its projects, particularly the crucial Jubilee project, the latter half of 2023 will likely witness a decrease in CapEx relative to the initial six months. A projection can be made, based on the timelines and management's comments, that Kosmos Energy's capital spending for Q3 will be approximately on par with the $170 million reported in Q2, potentially escalating to about $179 million in Q4. This sequential increase in Q4 is can be attributed to intensified activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the Tortue Subsea project in Mauritania and Senegal. The entire second half of 2023 might witness a capital outlay of around $349 million, down from the $376 million in H1-2023.The upshot here is that reduced capital expenses are colliding with a phase of ramp up in cash inflows, a combination that is likely to pivot Kosmos Energy to positive free cash flows in H2-2023, signaling a pivotal financial turnaround. But the horizon for Kosmos Energy looks even more promising.Kosmos Energy recently started drilling on the Tiberius prospect and seeks to begin drilling work on Winterfell project in the ongoing quarter, which also explains the above-mentioned increase in activity at the Gulf of Mexico. The Tiberius play could hold 135 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves. We'll likely hear more on this when the company releases its third quarter results. As for Winterfell, it is supposed to be a 100 million barrels of oil equivalent resource, but with substantial upside potential. Production from Winterfell is on track to begin form the first quarter of next year. In the same period, the Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project is also expected to achieve first gas. The company and its partners have been doing work on subsea installation while development and completion of the FLNG is underway. Although Tortue has seen some delays, it currently appears to be on time for Q1-2024 startup.The startup of new projects is going to do two things. First, the company's production is expected to surge in 2024, surpassing the anticipated 80,000 boe per day production of Q4-2023. This rise should bolster both its earnings and cash flows. Second, as more projects commence, the capital expenditures will likely diminish substantially. The scenario ahead paints a picture where Kosmos Energy will see growing cash inflows and reduced capital-related outflows. This aligns the company for a strong free cash flow stance.Recall, as discussed, one of Kosmos Energy's challenges has been its inconsistency in generating substantial free cash flows, which in part has contributed to its significant debt. But it seems the company is nearing a pivotal moment. The projects that have been in the pipeline for years are set to be operational, and combined with favorable oil prices, could significantly elevate Kosmos Energy's earnings and free cash flows. In my view, the company will likely channel this surplus cash towards reducing its debt. While the company's current debt metrics are on the higher side, indications are that its leverage situation could start improving as early as this year. In my opinion, such a shift is bound to positively influence the company's valuation.Kosmos Energy is on the verge of a transformation. The company, which has grappled with negative free cash flows and considerable debt, now appears poised to rectify its financial situation. There is a confluence of positive factors at play - the ramp-up in production, favorable oil market conditions, and the tapering of CapEx due to the completion of major projects. This trio is set to amplify both profits and free cash flows, which I expect the company to utilize predominantly for deleveraging the balance sheet. The future looks promising and I maintain a bullish stance on the stock.From a valuation standpoint, the stock trades at 10.6x forward earnings, marginally above the sectoral average of 10.5x, as per Seeking Alpha data. With a  of 'C' on Seeking Alpha, the stock might not seem enticing at first glance, suggesting that investors keen on value may want to anticipate a potential pullback before buying.However, investing in Kosmos Energy is not without its perils. Like its industry counterparts, the company's stock price remains tethered to the vicissitudes of oil prices. But what differentiates Kosmos is its relatively high debt load, which I think makes it inherently more vulnerable. A downturn in oil prices might exert a generalized downward pressure on all oil stocks, but the fall might be more pronounced for Kosmos due to its leverage profile. While the upside potential for Kosmos Energy is undeniable, potential investors must tread with caution. Its risk profile, accentuated by its debt position, makes it a choice that's not suitable for every investor, particularly those with a conservative risk appetite.

Dominion Energy: A Compelling Buy At Current Levels (Technical Analysis),"Dominion Energy, Inc. () is scheduled to announce its Q3 2023 earnings results on November 3, 2023. The company's guidance for Q3 2023 projects operating earnings per share to be between $0.72 and $0.87. This article explores Dominion Energy's financialDominion Energy's  for Q2 2023 showed notable changes compared to the previous year. The reported earnings for the June 30, 2023 quarter were $599 million, equating to $0.69 per share. This is a remarkable improvement when juxtaposed against the netHowever, when considering operating earnings specifically for Q2 2023, Dominion Energy reported $468 million, translating to $0.53 per share. While this is a substantial amount, it's worth noting that the operating earnings for the same period in the prior year were higher, at $658 million or $0.77 per share. The discrepancy between the net income and operating earnings can be attributed to various factors, including the gains and losses of nuclear decommissioning trust funds, the mark-to-market influence of economic hedging practices, and other sundry adjustments.Dominion Energy has guided its financial performance in the upcoming Q3 2023. The company expects its operating earnings per share to fall between $0.72 and $0.87. In total adjusted EBIT, a range of $1,299 to $1,439 is anticipated, a slight decrease compared to the $1,537 reported in Q3 2022. Additionally, the consolidated interest is forecasted to lie between $509 and $549, notably higher than the $401 recorded in Q3 2022. Consolidated income taxes are projected to be in the bracket of $132 to $182, which, while being a tad lower than the $192 in Q3 2022, still presents a sizeable amount. The operating earnings are predicted to be between $618 and $748, lower than the $944 from the same quarter in the previous year. Lastly, the average diluted shares are expected to range between $836 and $838, staying in the ballpark of the Q3 2023 figure of $833. While there are mixed signals in the provided figures, the forecast presents some headwinds for Dominion Energy, making it challenging to deem the outlook entirely bullish for the company.Dominion Energy's Q3 2023 forecast, despite showing a mix of improved and challenging numbers, suggests potential growth areas, particularly with the anticipated operating earnings per share, which may serve as a beacon for bullish investors. With the upcoming announcement, any positive shift in the forecasted numbers might prime the stock for a significant rally. This potential is further underscored by current technical analysis, indicating that the stock price is already on a significant pivot, and any improvement in the reported figures could amplify this momentum.Dominion Energy's long-term prospects appear bullish, as shown in the monthly chart below. The chart showcases that the pivotal long-term bottom for Dominion Energy was established in 2009, following the aftermath of the Great Recession. Since then, the stock has soared unprecedentedly, propelled by various influencing factors. The broad market rebound post-Great Recession was a boon to many stocks, notably those within the utilities sector. Dominion Energy enjoyed consistent revenue as a significant player in this sector due to its indispensable services. The firm also wisely ventured into infrastructure and clean energy projects during these times, positioning itself to cater to the surging demand for eco-friendly energy. Moreover, Dominion Energy's unwavering commitment to dividends and regular returns became a magnet for investors seeking dependable yields, further amplifying its stock value over the specified span.However, after hitting a record high of $83.08 in 2022, there's been a downtrend in its stock price, which has now formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. Moreover, the Fibonacci retracement from the 2009 lows to the all-time high presents $41 as the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, a potent long-term support. Currently, the stock is showcasing strength at this level, and there's an anticipation of an uptrend in momentum. Additionally, RSI is nearing oversold territory, suggesting a potential price reversal. Notably, the RSI was positioned at similar levels during the 2009 lows.Diving deeper into the market's oversold status, the weekly chart below also displays the RSI in the oversold region, hinting at a price resurgence. The previous week's candlestick pattern was an inside bar, indicating potential price consolidation and gearing up for a significant price move. Concurrently, this inside bar also signals a potential shift in price. With the monthly chart indicating an oversold scenario, the appearance of the inside bar on the weekly chart suggests a probable upward trajectory for the market.Based on the above discussion, it's evident that Dominion Energy's price is trading at a robust support level, with the price action hinting at a potential upward swing. This perspective is further solidified by the daily chart, which displays pronounced bullish markers. Although a descending channel has been in play over the past year, the stock has now found strong support at this channel's lower boundary. The appearance of bullish hammer patterns along this trend line is a positive signal.Investors may consider buying Dominion Energy stocks at the current levels, aiming for higher price rebounds. The first hurdle in this potential surge will be at $49. A monthly closure above this mark could signify continued bullish momentum. Should there be a further dip in price from current levels, investors may consider accumulating more long positions, provided the price remains above $31, aligning with the ascending broadening wedge's trend line. A monthly close below $31 would challenge the market's long-term bullish trajectory. Alternatively, a monthly close above $57 would likely confirm that the market has bottomed out, setting the stage for the stock rally toward all-time highs.A dip in year-over-year operating profits might indicate potential operational issues or challenges the company might encounter. Furthermore, with Dominion Energy's expansion into infrastructure and green energy initiatives, the company is now somewhat reliant on the sustained growth and adoption of renewable energy. Any hiccups in this industry's regulatory, technological, or market landscape could affect Dominion Energy's forthcoming performance. Dominion Energy is part of the utility domain, facing potential risks from regulatory shifts, variable energy costs, and issues in infrastructure development.From a technical viewpoint, the stock's price remains within the downward trend. Should the stock price fall below the $31 mark, it would breach the ascending broadening wedge formation, indicative of a strong bearish trend. Crossing this threshold would counteract the optimistic long-term prediction and could lead to significantly lower stock values.Dominion Energy demonstrated a marked transformation in its financial results for Q2 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year. Although the company's net income showcased a significant upswing, reaching $599 million from a net loss of $453 million in the previous year, its operating earnings witnessed a downturn, settling at $468 million against $658 million in Q2 2022. These variances can be credited to financial dynamics such as nuclear decommissioning trust fund adjustments, economic hedging impacts, and other miscellaneous adjustments.From a technical perspective, the stock has touched the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, situated at $41, and displays signs of reversal with bullish hammers on the daily charts. Furthermore, the monthly, weekly, and daily charts indicate an oversold condition. The emergence of these distinct bullish candles suggests the potential for an upward price movement. As Dominion Energy is scheduled to announce its earnings in the coming days, any significant positive deviation from the forecasted numbers could set the stage for a vigorous rally. This anticipated strong rally is based on the company's financials and bolstered by current technical indicators. Given these conditions, investors may consider acquiring Dominion Energy at its current price point and increasing positions if it remains above $31. If the price drops below $31, the technical ascending broadening wedge will be disrupted, negating the bullish momentum.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

General Motors says it will moderate electric vehicle production pace,"General Motors Company () reported revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year in Q3 to $44.13B vs. $43.34B consensus. EBIT-adjusted dropped 16.9% to $3.56B and automotive free cash flow was up 4.5% to $6.79B. North America EBIT-adjusted of $3.53B topped the consensus expectation of $3.18B.CEO Mary Barra said the current offer to the United Auto Workers union is the most significant that the company has ever proposed to the UAW, and the majority of its workforce will make $40.39 per hour, or roughly $84,000 a year by the end of the agreement’s term. Looking ahead, the automaker is reducing its fixed costs by $2B net of depreciation and amortization as it exits 2024. GM () is also moderating the acceleration of electric vehicle production in North America to protect pricing, adjust to slower near-term growth in demand, and implement engineering efficiency and other improvements that will make vehicles less expensive to produce, and more profitable.

Magna: You Still Have Some Upside Here,"On our  of (, ), we gave it a buy rating and ignored the doom that seemed to beThe stock took some time to bottom outWe look at the selloff in reaction to the recently released  and update our thesis.After a rather poor start to 2023, MGA was in form and delivered a whopper of a beat on both top and bottom lines. Revenues beat by $630 million and adjusted earnings came in at $1.50 per share, 28 cents ahead of consensus. The gain in revenues from last year was broad-based, with all areas of the globe increasing high double-digits.We did not get to see the impact of pricing on the , but we did get to see the margin changes in the next slide. The bulk of the EBITDA margin expansion came from higher volumes, as MGA's fixed costs created leverage on the upside. Interestingly, input costs fell a bit, and that comes from Q2 2022 levels where the Russian invasion had still many commodities flying high. Overall EBIT margins of 5.5% were a big relief relative to 3.8% seen last year.Interestingly, cash flow and free cash flow went in the opposite direction. This is not the most useful measure on a quarterly basis, but it does influence how active MGA will be in the capital markets to repurchase shares. You can see below that last year MGA bought back $212 million of shares in Q2-2022, while this year's activity was marginal at just $2 million. No doubt that that was influenced by low free cash flow.Investors might have been surprised that the stock sold off post Q2 2023, as MGA followed the double beat with a  for light vehicle production levels.Total sales will now be closer to $43 billion versus the earlier midpoint of near $41 billion. If there was some disappointment here, it likely came from EBIT margins just moving up a shade from 4.9% (midpoint) to 5.0% (midpoint) relative to previous guidance.The stock was up more than 35% from the June lows to the earnings, and it is very reasonable to expect some profit taking as well.MGA  of Veoneer Active Safety for $1.525 billion on June 1, 2023. This is a big purchase for MGA and pushes its debt to EBITDA well above its usual comfort range. At 2.19X, MGA is going to be focused on deleveraging going forward and share repurchases will be minor.The current consensus is for about 6% revenue growth in both 2024 and 2025.This looks achievable. Some might wonder what exactly will create auto sales growth when the probability of a recession in this timeframe is almost 100%. The answer to that is where auto inventories stand, or rather sit.Those are abysmal levels and have only improved marginally from our last update. They need to be built up at some point, and we think MGA's revenues may actually run countercyclical for the first time in its history. So, we buy the revenue possibility. Even a 3% increase in volumes and 3% price increases will get us there easily, and logically volumes need to increase a lot more if we have to replenish that stock above.What we are not exactly buying here are the earnings estimates. Here we see true hockey stick estimates with torrid 25% annualized growth all the way to 2025. That kind of earnings expansion will require a solid margin expansion, and one we think will be difficult.For MGA, the price to sales ratio is the king for cyclical turning points. So regardless of our skepticism towards the earnings estimates, we still think the stock is cheap.What is the wonderful part of our thesis here is that Magna International Inc. does not need to do a lot to deliver upside. If it can meet those sales forecasts, and just maintain its price to sales ratio (which is in the middle of its historical range), you can see another 15% upside by the end of 2025. Couple that with a 3% dividend yield, and you have prospects for 8-9% annual returns here. Nothing to write home about and certainly nothing that should get anyone excited in an era of risk-free rates at 5.5%. But we would look for more upside and our $75 price target is still achievable if MGA's earnings estimates turn out to be accurate. The key risks come from a protracted UAW strike and a deep recession where car inventories remain low and don't build at all. The beaten down valuation would provide some buffer, but MGA could trade as low as $40 in that scenario. As before, we are maintaining our buy rating on Magna International Inc. with the caveat that options will continue to provide superior risk-adjusted returns as they have till now. targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety.

Gevo: Exciting Future But Need Proof Of Concept,"The need to find renewable energy sources is quite high and I think that the hype for Gevo, Inc. () got a little out of hand and the market is nowGEVO is a dynamic player in the renewable fuels sector, known for its innovative contributions across various segments of the industry. The company operates through three key segments: Gevo, Agri-Energy, and Renewable Natural Gas, each playing a vital role in its mission to drive sustainable and eco-friendly fuel solutions.Within these segments, GEVO offers a diverse range of renewable products that cater to a wide spectrum of needs. These include renewable gasoline and diesel, isooctane, isobutanol, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable natural gas, isobutylene, ethanol, and even animal feed and protein. This comprehensive portfolio underscores the company's commitment to addressing the evolving demands of both consumers and industries for cleaner, more environmentally friendly energy sources. The broad set of areas that GEVO aims to serve and operate in I think has been a key factor for all the attention it is receiving.Furthermore, there is a clear market that GEVO could serve quite efficiently if they continue to scale up their capabilities and production levels. The for SAF is at over 100 billion gallons per year. With the tech that GEVO is working on they could be a significant player in this market in time, and if the projects they have in the pipeline are achieved on time as well.Looking at the income statement from the last quarter I think some things are negative and visible. The first one is the amount of share dilution the company is doing. YoY it has risen by quite a lot to 237 million outstanding. This is adding more and more risk to shareholders as the stop of dilution doesn't seem to be anywhere in sight. The reason for a large amount of dilution comes from the rise in operational expenses for the company, sitting at $23 million for the quarter alone, up from $16 million in Q1 FY2022. This has been a factor because of the rising interest rates causing a higher interest expense amount for the business. Going into the next few quarters I don’t think there will be a significant improvement on this front as GEVO needs to scale up their projects and operations to seal a sufficient amount of steady revenues to pay down expenses without resorting to diluting shares.Looking at the valuation of the company right now I do have to say it's quite expensive. The top line is improving very quickly and this is resulting in the p/s decreasing very rapidly on a FWD basis. However, paying 15x sales is still a significant premium in comparison to the rest of the sector and ultimately a deciding factor in why I can't consider the company a buy right now. Given that the company is also posting a negative top line, there is a significant risk that gross profits may be volatile, and poor results would likely lead to a higher p/s and an even higher premium. I fear that the market would likely punish the share price by cutting the valuation to reflect the additional risk and volatility. I wouldn't be considering GEVO a buy until based on p/s it reaches under 2, which is far closer to the rest of the sector median, which would be a more fair price to pay.Cash is a precious commodity that GEVO finds in limited supply. The company faces a challenge in accumulating the necessary funds to support its ambitious projects, each of which carries a substantial  tag, averaging around $850 million. This financial hurdle underscores the importance of securing adequate capital to bring these ventures to fruition successfully. Compounding this financial constraint is the prevailing high-interest rate environment, which further complicates matters for GEVO. Elevated interest rates can exert additional pressure on the cost of financing these projects, potentially eroding profit margins and extending the timeline for achieving a return on investment. I think that interest rates are going to remain quite high for a prolonged period and the markets seem to think the same. This will add a significant amount of interest expenses to the income statement and suppress profitability even more. Right now the TTM interest expenses are at $2.2 million, up from $1.2 million in 2022. With only $9.2 million in revenue in the last 12 months there is a clear need here to raise the margins and scale the production further.As previously noted, the completion date for NZ1 has faced delays on multiple occasions, casting uncertainty over the project's timeline. Furthermore, the project's future remains contingent on securing financing approval from the DOE, a process fraught with challenges and uncertainties. The recurrent postponements of the completion date underscore the intricate nature of this endeavor and the hurdles it has encountered along the way. The project's feasibility and financial viability must align with the stringent criteria set by the DOE, making financing approval a pivotal milestone for its realization. The negative news is likely to add further right to the share price and result in the share price falling further.As GEVO is yet to produce a profitable bottom line it's important to watch the  and liabilities base of the business to see where there may be some issues arising in the future. The cash for GEVO right now is at some of the highest levels in its history, at $347 million. With the last quarter having nearly a quarter of $100 million in operational expenses this cash position is sufficient to cover around 3 years at least if expenses remain similar. That means that dilution is likely to occur still for the business.GEVO is an exciting opportunity to get exposure to a variety of markets through the broad set of industries it services and plans on servicing as well. The company is yet to produce a positive earnings report though and this is heavily introducing a lot of risk to investors as they need to resort to diluting shares to raise capital. This is a practice that is likely to continue in my opinion and ultimately leads me to rate GEVO a hold rather than a buy right now. When the margins are positive and constantly staying there as well I could consider the company a buy depending on the price of course. Preferably I wouldn't want to pay more than 10x earnings and even better would be under 9. suggest that could be in 2026 if EPS estimates come true and the price remains the same. I will therefore be more passive and stick with the hold rating.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Global Manufacturing Remains In The Doldrums As Demand Continues To Weaken,"The  Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) compiled by S&P Global, signalled a largely stalled factory sector in September, the PMI registering 49.1 compared to 49.0 in August. The latest reading indicated a marginal deterioration in business conditions for a thirteenth successive month.Europe continued to see the steepest downturn, followed by Japan, leaving the rest of Asia and the US as key areas of growth.While improved supply helped producers fulfil backlogs of orders, a lack of new orders led to a further marginal decline in production. Falling global trade flows and ongoing inventory reduction policies remained key drags on factory output, though the latter is showing some signs of having peaked. Companies expectations of output in the year ahead nevertheless remained in the doldrums, running well below the survey average despite lifting slightly higher compared to August, to hint at no imminentGlobal manufacturing output fell marginally for a fourth consecutive month in September, according to the latest PMI surveys compiled by S&P Global and sponsored by JP Morgan. At 49.7, up from 49.4 in August, the output index from the Global Manufacturing PMI - our preferred measure of current factory production - signalled a slight easing in the rate of contraction for a second successive month but has now indicated falling output in ten of the past 14 months.Official data, compiled from various national statistical agencies, has shown a similar lacklustre performance over the past year, with global output consequently running 0.1% below that of a year ago in July (the latest month for which data are available for the major economies) based on our calculations.Looking at the largest economies, production continued to fall at solid rates in both the eurozone and the UK in September and declined to a lesser extent in Japan. In contrast, output continued to rise in mainland China and in the rest of Asia, with a return to modest growth also recorded in the US.The recent manufacturing production malaise is attributable to an ongoing deterioration in demand, as indicated by a fifteenth successive monthly decline in new orders received by factories worldwide in September. Leading the downturn in orders was a further marked drop in global trade, as measured by new export orders received by manufacturers around the world, which continued to fall at one of the steepest rates seen since the global financial crisis.Some encouragement can be gleaned from the rate of loss of new orders moderating during the month, but the pace of decline remained greater than the decline in production, meaning producers once again had to eat into their backlogs of work to help sustain current production levels. Backlogs of orders, which had accumulated to an unprecedented degree during the supply constraints of the pandemic, consequently also fell for a fifteenth straight month in September.Improved delivery times have helped producers fulfill orders this year, with average supplier delivery times shortening on average in September for an eighth month in a row. These faster deliveries contrast with the unprecedented supply chain delays and shortages seen during the pandemic.However, some key components remain in short supply, and various other factors have acted as headwinds. According to PMI survey respondents, weak demand - notably from a disappointing mainland China recovery, high prices, and a post-pandemic switch in demand from goods to services, have all contributed to falling global order books this year, with deglobalisation acting as an additional drag on global trade flows.Destocking also continued to play a role in subduing global production and demand in September. The number of inputs bought by manufacturers continued to fall sharply, dropping at a faster rate than production in a sign of widespread ongoing inventory management.Stocks of raw materials fell accordingly, down for an eleventh successive month. Part of the raw material inventory decline was attributed to companies no longer needing to retain high levels of safety stocks, as witnessed during the pandemic.Stocks of finished goods were also allowed to fall, dropping for the ninth time in the past ten months, often as a result of deliberate cost-cutting inventory reduction policies. However, the incidence of factories deliberately unwinding their stock holdings of finished goods due to destocking policies has fallen sharply since peaking back in March to hint that the drag on production from the inventory cycle may turn soon.Worries about recession risks and the impact of higher-for-longer interest rates were key factors denting optimism about production in the coming year. Future output expectations remained well below their long-run average in September despite picking up slightly in August, led by improved expectations in the US. The data suggest companies are not anticipating any imminent overall improvement in the global manufacturing situation, though we continue to watch the inventory cycle for signs that production may see some support from this area as we head into 2024.",0,2023-10-03T04:17:00.000-04:00

Welcome to the Halliburton Company, Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.Hello! And thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2023 conference call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call.Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements.These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.ThankLet's jump right into the highlights. Total company revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while operating income grew 23%. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all geographic markets.North America revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Our completion and production division grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while margins expanded 280 basis points, margins expanded 105 basis points sequentially driven by international operations, while North American C&P margins remained approximately flat the last quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division grew revenue 4% year-over-year, while margins expanded 168 basis points.Finally, we generated $874 million of cash from operations, $511 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock and $150 million of debt during the quarter.To our over 45,000 employees globally. Thank you for another outstanding quarter, you executed our strategy and delivered excellent financial results. I'll begin with what I see in the macro environment.Reliable and affordable energy remains at the very center of global economic growth and security. The most recent world oil outlook from OPEC expects 10 million barrels of oil demand growth before the end of the decade and further demand growth through 2045.Maintaining production while adding incremental supply requires meaningful long-term investment in both short and long cycle barrels to meet demand. This challenge is reflected in our customers' activity levels and future development plans. Consistent with this outlook, we expect continued demand growth for oilfield services in 2024 and beyond.Everything I see today strengthens my conviction in the long duration of this upcycle. Against this backdrop, I believe the execution of our strategy will deliver strong free cash flow, growing margins and more cash return to shareholders.Starting with North America, Halliburton performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our North America business has changed. Despite the U.S. rig count decreasing around 20% since Q4 of 2022, Halliburton delivered strong revenue and margin performance during this period. That's quite a different result from what Halliburton would have delivered in prior cycles.Since 2015, we changed our strategy. We changed our operating model, and the market structure changed. Our strategy in North America is to maximize value. Executing this strategy made many of our decisions over the last few years crystal clear, including our decision to invest in differentiated and value-added technologies, such as our Zeus electric fleets, automation, and our fiber optic downhole fracturing diagnostics. We know that in a competitive market to capture value, you must first create value.Our decision to derisk returns and maximize free cash flow by only building fracturing equipment under long-term contracts. And finally, our decision to retire old equipment when returns are not sufficient rather than to pursue market share. Maximizing value means just that, do the things that improve returns and stop doing the things that lower them.Next, we fundamentally changed our operating model. We removed $1 billion of fixed costs from our business in 2020. Those cost reductions were structural and remain in place today. As a result, today, our cost structure is more variable and less fixed. And it's one of the reasons we have the flexibility to pursue returns rather than market share.Our commitment to continuous improvement drove significant changes in the way we work, which delivered efficiency improvements in our operations. This resulted in a 68% improvement in hours pumped per crew in just the last four years.Finally, the E&P and services markets fundamentally changed. Today the market is more consolidated, more focused on returns, and more focused on free cash flow generation. We see the benefits of this change. Customers assign value to technology and efficiency, and the service industry is rewarded for returns rather than growth.Never before as the success of our North America business been better aligned with the success of our customers who make significant long-term investments in the region. I expect the combination of our value proposition and strategy will deliver a more profitable business that generates more free cash flow for years to come.Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's revenue grew 17% compared to the same quarter of last year. In the third quarter, we saw activity increase in both divisions, though particularly in our completions and production division. Our results clearly demonstrate Halliburton strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth.We execute our profitable growth strategy through our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach with customers, all of which build on our foundation as a leader in service quality and execution.I expect the market for oilfield services will further tighten as asset intensive offshore activity increases. More importantly, I expect that pricing returns will serve as the mechanism to allocate scarce equipment. This is a great market for Halliburton to execute its strategy for profitable international growth.I'm excited about our international business and we're on track to deliver high teens year-on-year growth in 2023. Looking ahead, 2024 is coming into view and I expect to see international activity again directionally higher, with market growth in the double-digit range.I'd like to take a few minutes and talk more about our global offshore business. Let me start with some color. Offshore represents more than 50% of our business outside of North America land. About 25% of our C&P revenue is generated offshore. More than 40% of our D&E revenue is generated offshore.All of our regions contribute materially to our offshore revenue. All of our product lines operate offshore and Halliburton leads in many well construction product lines key to offshore development. Customers choose Halliburton because we collaborate and deliver impactful results. The combination of our leading product lines, and our collaboration from design through well delivery is what drives superior results for our customers.One example is in Norway, where according to IHS Rushmore data, the Aker BP Alliance where Halliburton provides well construction services consistently represents the top quartile of drilling performance. This performance matters even more in a market where offshore rig rates and spread costs are rising.With our customers, we deliver some of the most technically complex wells in our industry. We provide leading solutions in many areas including high pressure, deepwater completions, complex multilateral junctions, ultra deep reading LWD tools, narrow margin drilling fluids and tailored lightweight cement.These solutions enable our customers to efficiently and reliably develop their offshore reserves and maximize the value of their assets. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business underpinned by efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to compete in all parts of the offshore business including exploration, development and intervention has never been better.Let me close with this. I'm both excited and confident in the outlook for our business, the duration of this upcycle the clarity and depth of our strategy and the strength of our execution.Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?Thank you, Jeff, and good morning.Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.79. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $1 billion a sequential increase of 3%. Operating margin for the company was 17.9% in Q3, a 207 basis point increase over Q3 2022.Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.5 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $746 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 21%. These results were primarily due to increased stimulation activity internationally, higher cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, and improved completion tool sales globally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping services in North America.In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.3 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $378 million, which was also flat from Q2. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%, an increase of 168 basis points over Q3 last year. Sequential changes were driven by higher fluid services in Middle East Asia, and Latin America, and increased wireline activity in Latin America and Europe/Africa. These were offset by decreased drilling related services, lower project management activity and software sales in Mexico.Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services, and drilling fluids in Argentina, improved completion tool sales in Brazil, and higher project management and drilling related services in Colombia and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were lower software sales, decreased project management and lower well construction services in Mexico.Europe/Africa revenue in Q3 was $734 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by improved well construction services, higher completion tool sales and improved wireline activity in Norway, and higher completion tool sales in the Caspian area. These were partially offset by lower activity in Africa across multiple product service lines.Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.4 billion, which was flat from q2. These results were driven by higher well construction in Iraq, increased drilling related services and completion tool sales in Qatar, and higher pressure pumping and fluid services in Asia. These were offset by decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, and India and lower drilling, testing and well intervention services in Asia.In North America, revenue in Q3 was $2.6 billion, a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land, and lower well intervention services in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases was improved completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico.Moving on to other items, in Q3, our corporate and other expenses were $64 million. For Q4, we expect our corporate expense to increase by about $5 million as a result of timing and special items. In Q3, we spent $23 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect these expenses to be approximately $14 million, which makes our spent approximately $50 million for 2023 as planned. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, which was flat from the prior quarter. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.Other net expense for Q3 was $28 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 21%, based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to remain approximately flat. Capital expenditure for Q3 were $409 million, we anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $874 million, and free cash flow was $511 million. We expect to generate over $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2023.Finally, consistent with our capital return policy of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock during Q3. Additionally, during Q3, we repurchased $150 million of debt.Now turning to our near-term outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see Q4 unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate revenue to decrease by 3% to 5% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to decrease 25 to 75 basis points as a result of lower North America land activity due to holidays and lower winter month efficiencies, partially offset by higher year-end completion tool sales.In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate revenue to grow by 4% to 6% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to increase 75 to 125 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher global activity.I will now turn the call back to Jeff.Thanks, Eric.Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I'm pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Our North America business performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America.Our international results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, and our ability to compete in all parts of the business has never been better.And now let's open it up for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.So Jeff, the duration story internationally is very compelling with the capacity expansion in Middle East, offshore FIDs and offshore work that you were talking about. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how that translates into the cadence of international growth over the next 12 to 24 months. International sale looks a little sluggish this quarter, MENA was flat. I know Kuwait's been a bit slow, but I'm just wondering, should we start to see the region accelerate in 2024?Yes. Thank you, Dave. And look, I expect that it will. And I've talked about growth for 2024 double digits. But to frame that, our strategy is profitable international growth. And we've grown 20% in '22, high teens this year, double digits next year. So I'm comfortable with the growth and expect we will continue to see strong growth, certainly above market growth. But we're doing that while improving margins and expanding margins. And so I think that our strategy is crystal clear around what we're going about. There's plenty of market there to do that and expect we will continue to do that in '24 and beyond.And if I could just shift over to kind of one of the big topics out there is M&A, Chevron, Exxon, [indiscernible] EPs in North America. Can you talk a bit about what this means to Halliburton. On the one hand, I'm thinking this should provide you really significant visibility on your development programs. On the other hand, perhaps your pricing levers might be a bit compromised if you only have a handful of large customers. Could you just kind of big picture, talk about what's leading to your business, please?Yes. Big picture, good for Halliburton. I think it does a couple of things what we're seeing. Certainly, it demonstrates the long-term importance of oil and gas and more specifically, worldwide and more importantly, the long-term importance of North America. I mean what we're seeing are big players that take a really long view, and these are the kind of customers that clearly work through cycles. And so I think we'll see a much more stable North America I really like our position with our customer mix today is clearly biased. Most of our work is with very large privates and publics. And so I like our position there.And then more importantly, these are customers that care about the kinds of things we work on at Halliburton. So when we work on, I think important things like productivity, efficiency and recovery. And we talk about all 3 of those in our business. And I think we're unique in the way that we approach those. So I think it will be good for Halliburton.And what this accelerated adoption of e-frac, you think, with both of those two customers?Look, I think that's exactly the kind of tool that customers like this want to have in their hands, and we're seeing pretty good adoption. I would say north of 60% of our business today are repeat customers. So these aren't science projects. This is things that are being baked into workflows.It comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.One of the notable things about the quarter was the return of capital, the $200 million of share repurchases. Maybe you could just frame out for the market, how you're thinking about your share repurchase strategy and setting us up for your framework as we go into 2024?Yes. Good morning, Neil. So look, dividends and it's clearly part of our return strategy. But directionally nothing has changed in our overall policy of returning about 50% or over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I mean right now, we like the flexibility that buybacks give us, and we're thinking similarly as we get into next year. If we look at what we've done this year, we've returned $1 billion already to shareholders so far this year. As our business continues to grow and our margins continue to improve as well. I would expect that these overall returns would be higher as we get into 2024.Okay. That's helpful. And we appreciated a little bit of color on 4Q, but I was wondering if you could kind of unpack some of that guidance a little bit more, talk about what you're thinking about from a regional perspective? And any comments that we need to keep in mind as we think about the next quarter sequentially.Yes. I think, Neil, we're typically giving guidance on a division basis, which is the way we report numbers, and I think we will leave it at that.Well, maybe just a little bit of color around North America, we're going to see some seasonality as we've described it in the last few years. We've had really strong tailwinds into Q4. I would expect this year, we'll see what I would describe as more normal seasonality. And then, clearly, there will be completion tools and other sales in there that help internationally, we'll probably see software sales in Q4, probably Q1 and more activity and more pricing. And hopefully, that's helpful color.And it comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.If I could, I'd love, Jeff, as you would talk a little bit about the competitive environment that you see in front of you now. It seems to me that we've had a big change in the overall market over the last decade or so with one competitor kind of dropping back, one moving into other non-oil and gas businesses and so kind of leaving the oil and gas side is somewhat about a duopoly for yourself and your main competitor but both of you are focused on returns. And so it's not a pricing fight or a market share fight, it's kind of, hey, we're in the same game, let's generate cash, let's generate free cash flow to get back to shareholders. Let's get pricing up for returns. Is that kind of how you see '24, '25, '26 unfolding or am I mistaken in my view, we've got a different competitive environment.Well, James, it's highly competitive in the marketplace. And we are absolutely focused on our strategy at Halliburton and I've been really clear about that. And so independent of what anyone does in the marketplace from a Halliburton standpoint, we are maximizing value in North America. We are growing profitably internationally and driving capital efficiency. And I think some of the cash flows that you see and improving cash flow that you see is driven out of our fundamental strategy to develop R&D that is more capital efficient. And so this has been a strategy underway for probably 5 or 6 years, maybe longer. And today, we're seeing the fruits of that. But from a competitive perspective, highly competitive marketplace and we're always continuing to lower total cost of ownership for our customers and also drive the three things. And the outcome of that is clearly better free cash flow, more cash flow return to customers, but it starts with that basic strategy.Right. Got it. Okay. And then, if we think about North America as this cash machine, as I think about it for you guys, with some seasonality here in the fourth quarter, do you anticipate pricing degradation? Or do you think that everything kind of holds up here and we're in just kind of this continued harvesting period.Well, look, I think that North America, as we look forward into '24, the consolidation activity that we've seen is clearly a demonstration of how important North America is. In the kind of environment that we're in today, it's hard for me to imagine operators who want to be smaller rather than bigger given the $85, $90 commodity price. So I think that will drive certain amount of activity up from here.From our perspective, we see largely a steady market from as you described it, just partly because we are focused on retiring diesel fleets and transitioning to electric. We've got a very clear strategy around North America. And we believe that our service quality performance and technology, those get better every day, and they drive margins. So this is an important component. They drive margins.And I think our customers understand the level of investment required in order to deliver service quality, performance and technology. So we've seen what this market looks like when we burn up equipment at very low returns that don't allow for that reinvestment, probably we've seen that, that's not a good outcome certainly not for service companies, but it's also not a good outcome for operators. So I think that's what gives me confidence in sort of the stability of this. And to that point, we're mostly I'd say, mostly contracted for 2024.And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.Yes. Good morning. Probably just to follow up on a couple of the questions already been asked, maybe slightly differently. As you think about the outlook here for the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of '24, I was just curious where you feel like you're being properly cautious, maybe slightly overly cautious and where you think things actually need to come through to sort of hit the numbers, right? I'm just sort of looking for some guidelines maybe of what to pay attention to as the quarter unfolds.Look, I think the guidance we've given you is fairly clear, and we've got a lot of confidence in the way we looked at the market. And as I described, seasonality in North America, it's something we've certainly seen before and we know what that looks like. I expect our international business continues to do, continues to grow, and we've already sort of laid out what we expect this year to look like. So I feel confident in our outlook. And then, as we go into the first half of next year, I think that we're going to clearly see North America up from here. Maybe that's the color that wasn't clear when I answered the last question. But in terms of sort of where the commodity price is and also not as dependent on that, but really what we're seeing in terms of customers' plans.And also, just the decline rates in North America. So the reality is you have to do more work in order to stay flat. And so I suspect that we'll see some of that as well. As the rest of next year plays out, it's too early to call that. We don't have budget numbers from customers but the customers operating in North America today are the kinds of folks that execute their plans and so those plans will be executed. I hope that's helpful.Yes, it is. My follow-up question is a little bit different tack. But it gets back to some of your opening comments about adjusting your cost structure and less fixed, more variable, we've typically thought of the way to measure performance with service companies in Halliburton, off the incremental margins. But if the fixed costs are becoming more variable, then maybe we don't see quite the same change in the incremental margin, but we'd still pay attention to the absolute margin. So maybe just as a way to ask about where you think the absolute margin can go relative to what we've seen over the last several quarters, any expectations there. I mean, is it -- these margins with revenue growth or margin expansion from here?Well, look, I tend to always think more about margin expansion just because it's sort of core to how we're operating the business. But I think that the cost reductions have been super important. And I think a lot of what we've seen has been off the back of that but that's critical to how we run the business. And as I've said, maximizing value in North America is our fundamental strategy, and that will translate into strong incrementals, which we've seen. And I don't expect those have gone away, but that's partly because of the type of equipment we're putting in the market as much as anything.And so as we continue to pivot from diesel to electric, I would expect to see over time as those go into the marketplace, stronger incrementals. I would also say the same about what we're doing sort of quietly but equally important with drilling tools in North America. So we have been able to put together much better capital efficiency around our drilling business, and it's gaining traction. So those are the kind of things that drive incrementals even off of a fairly low fixed cost base.And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed.Yes. Good morning. Jeff, the trends in the U.S. certainly seem positive for Halliburton. So my question is, if we experience just a half recovery in market activities, so let's just say we get back about 50% of the rigs that we lost in the U.S. In that scenario, can Halliburton get back close to operating your peak frac fleet count from earlier this year. Can you get back close to peak numbers in that scenario?Yes. Thanks. So I mean, look, we've got a really good position in North America. And I think as we look at '24, a couple of things, even beyond activity is, I view we have asymmetric sort of opportunity in North America. So I've said, I expect activity to be up, not down as we go into '24, just given where we are and as you described it. But the opportunity is around demand we see for [indiscernible]. So that's an opportunity that is largely unique to us in terms of the way we're approaching that. And certainly, our drilling business is equally an asymmetric opportunity for Halliburton just given the fundamental change in technology and the ability to put that to work in North America. And I think that will benefit on its own just from the technology, but equally so, maybe from any growth in rig count will only accelerate the uptake on that technology.Got it. And another unique opportunity for Halliburton has been on the production side of the business, particularly outside of the U.S. as you take in the [indiscernible] business internationally and build the chemical facility in the Middle East. Can you just update us on the outlook for continued share gains within production outside of the U.S. in 2024?Yes, thanks. The lift business continues to grow. I mean, this is a fantastic technology. And the reason it's leading in North America is because of its execution and its technology. And those are the same reasons that we're seeing the growth internationally. And so also an initial really solid contract in Kuwait that has continued to expand in the Middle East with trials and opportunities and actually getting meaningful traction.Similarly, in Latin America, where we had quite a bit of success in a variety of countries, including Ecuador and others. And look, lift is becoming -- our ESPs are becoming more resilient, the technology continues to improve. The summit team is at the leading edge of that. And so look, very high expectations for where they go and expect that, that is, again, another unique international growth opportunity for Halliburton, very resilient in the North America sort of independence of activity rig count activity. And then, the chemical business is it continues to get traction. We're on pace, we're on plan, I would say, with the plant in the Middle East. So it's doing what we had expected it to do. And so pleased with where we are.And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.Jeff, you talked last quarter about a record number of these fleets that you signed in 2Q. I wanted to see if you could give us a qualitative update on incremental these fleets maybe interest from customers and how you see your, this program shaping up for 24? And then, if you could provide any commentary on conventional equipment displacements, that would be helpful, too.Look, we've continued on the track we were on. We've continued to see very strong demand. Yes, we've signed up new fleets. This quarter, we put a couple of work. I believe that trajectory is unchanged. And so very pleased with the trajectory that we see around e-fleets and they're performing very, very well. So that continues to sort of build up the confidence of the market and that technology. I think that the fact that they are lower TCO than existing equipment is a big part of why they are successful. From a displacement standpoint, we've described as we bring out electric equipment, we would retire diesel equipment. And I've always said, it's not a perfect science of 1:1. But we've had an opportunity this year to retire diesel fleets, which we've described. And by doing that has effectively accelerated the marketplace. And what we're really pleased to see a repeat customer. And I think that's an important component of confidence in the technology, customers come back for a second one.And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed.Two things for me. The first, when you think -- you mentioned this I think a little bit earlier, Jeff, but when you think about U.S. production levels, where do you think frac fleet activity needs to be. Are we around that level, do you think to keep production flat under or over.Look, I think that's going to be unique to different and certainly the different operators and levels of efficiency and many other things. Look, I think that we'll know a lot more as we go into next year and start to see where production levels are. Clearly, this year saw a lot of broad activity by a lot of operators early in the year, and I suspect North America is getting the benefit of that right now. The private market was super busy the first part of the year 2023. You saw that group not really drill wells as we got into the late summer, which is the time they normally would. And so I think that will weigh on probably production as we go into '24.That said, we've got a commodity market that is probably quite supportive. And so it'd be hard to imagine less, not more. But in terms of production going into 2024, it would seem that a big chunk of what was added in '23 is not repeating right now with good weigh on production. That said, as I've said before, I think we'll see activity up, not down from here for those reasons.Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question was around sort of the maybe lesser Tier 1 acreage out there and sort of the impact that you think it has on how's business from both the pressure pumping but also across C&P in North America as far as, does it help, do you think efficiencies are slowing on the completion side. So how does that phenomena play into sort of demand and service intensity of sort of on a per production or per well basis.Look, it drives service intensity up without question. And that's good for Halliburton. It also drives technology in terms of things like our downhole diagnostics, which we call SmartFleet. But I mean I think addressing productivity per foot which comes in the form of efficiency, and placement, reconciling all of those things between well design and production, having the tools to do that, and that's precisely what we introduced to the marketplace in the form of SmartFleet, which is a critical building block in my view, solving for that. And I think that's why we're seeing uptake on that technology.So I think that never bet against this industry ever. I mean our customers in North America are very smart, very good, very competitive. And the history of this industry broadly is improving recovery factors, whether it's through process and methodology or automation or in many cases, just physics and science. And I think that what that does do is it drives more reps for Halliburton. It will drive more sand in wells that will do a lot of things. But I also expect, as we've done for so many years, that we'll see the actual breakeven cost or the cost of producing oil and gas in North America continue to come down on the back of technology.It comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed.Thank you. I wanted to ask about the C&P performance here in the third quarter and the outlook for fourth quarter. If I look at sort of the original guidance for third quarter, it was for margins to be flat, but they ended up growing by 100 basis points. And then as we look to fourth quarter, the decline is kind of guided to 100 basis points. Was there a pull forward of some completion tool sales that would usually occur in the fourth quarter? Is that explaining it? Or are there some other elements that we should be thinking about as we bridge from where we were in the second quarter?Look, I expect to see strong performance from C&P, Q4 and beyond. Look, I think that I've described some seasonality. But I think what you're really seeing is the quantity and the quality of the development work that's happening around the world. I mean, you saw equipment is clearly tight moving up. We've got a leadership position. And several things in C&P whether it's production enhancement, which is very important internationally as well, cementing and completion tools. And then, certainly, it helps that North America executed very well. So we've seen flat margins despite the rig count being down.Okay. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had was on kind of the international growth. So if I look at your Middle East and Africa, it was flat this quarter. I'm curious how you're thinking about that region and maybe the other regions if we're going to get to sort of a low double digits for the year. are any regions leading that or would you expect them all to grow at a similar type rate?Well look, as I said, I expect we finished this year at high double digits, not low double digits. And so look, expect to see growth, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean, growth can be lumpy at different times. It depends on what's happening in a particular region on any given day or set of quarters. But I would say this quarter, we've grown 17% overall and would expect to see solid growth in '24. And so that will be in bright region, but I am not concerned at all about quarter-to-quarter where growth happens to be. We've seen very strong in Middle East earlier this year, and we'll probably see growth for the full year. So I think that quarter-to-quarter, trying to measure that is not as impactful as sort of year-on-year. And I think we take a set of assets and we put them to work where we see the best returns on them. And some of those C&P margins that you're seeing are at the root of that.It comes from the line of Jim Rollyson with Raymond James. Please proceed.Jeff, I just had one question. On the pricing front, you've talked about this, obviously, over the past few quarters. And my recollection historically is international pricing kind of takes a longer cycle to roll over. I'm kind of curious what you think -- what inning you think we're in from a pricing perspective if we're truly in this longer duration cycle and just how you think about that impact from here on margins since your margins are pretty strong relative to historical cycles already.Look, I think that continue to strengthen. [Technical Difficulty]. We expect margins to continue to strengthen. The asset feedback, let's see. We expect margins to continue to strengthen internationally because they tend to move 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. However, what's important is, we're also seeing growth in offshore at the same time. And so we've got a tightening of capacity that sort of comes at a higher rate from offshore work just because it requires more capital offshore than it does onshore. And so the type of activity that we're seeing is continuing to tighten the market. At the same time, so that's driving pricing to a large degree. And I think the type of activity that we see planned that is either underway or being tendered or just being planned that clearly extends well into the decade is going to serve to drive our pricing.And it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed.I'm kind of curious here, Jeff, right, you given mentioned a number of different positive factors, right, that are driving your business, both internationally and domestically. And on the domestic front, right, your fleet mix, technology, service quality, et cetera. So with that dynamic and with that kind of mix, right, are you confident or comfortable enough to suggest that you think your North America revenue could grow in 2024, even if overall activity is flat or down?Yes. Yes. I mean, again, I think we've got some unique opportunity. Asymmetric sort of positioning with Halliburton in terms of electric fleets that we're able to do that the market wants and that we can produce that is unique to Halliburton. And also, as I've described, our drilling technology as that grows in North America that will be, again, an opportunity for growth for Halliburton that probably won't be consistent across the broader piece of that. So yes, I am confident that Halliburton has the ability and will grow.Okay. Good. Great. Now I have a follow-up. I think in your prior conversations, I understood this correctly that when you're being approached by customers to talk about e-fleet opportunities. You guys are kind of looking at contractual commitments that maybe could be as long as 3 years. Is that still the case?Yes. Look, it's a very good technology. We've talked about maximizing value in North America. That is what we're doing. And part of maximizing value in North America is building technology that customers want and creates value for customers. And for that, this is a fairly low risk decision by an operator realistically. The operators that we're talking to about e-fleets are the kind of operators that will always have equipment working.The reality is the first question is describe a scenario where you won't be fracking at all and the answer to that is there is no scenario where a large operator will not be fracking. Then it becomes, why wouldn't you want that one fleet at least to be your lowest cost operating fleet because it's burning natural gas, it's emitting less and it's working at the highest performance.At that point, this becomes a much easier discussion because it is the lowest cost operating fleet. It is extremely high efficiency and it lowers their overall cost. And so all of a sudden, that type of commitment isn't a huge hurdle to get over for customers that are committed to the long term in this business and that's been our experience. And I think that new capital should earn a return as part of maximizing value and we've got something that creates value for customers.Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A answer period. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Miller.Thank you, Carmen. Before we close out, Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. And our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction and the long duration of this up cycle. So I look forward to speaking with you next quarter, Carmen will close out the call.Thank you. And with that, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-24T12:54:10.000-04:00
Jack in the Box: Limited Margin Of Safety At Current Levels,"Just over a year ago, I  (), noting that while the stock was becoming more reasonably valued, it was still hard to justify paying up for the stock at $75.00 given the difficult macroJack in the Box released its fiscal Q3 results in mid-August, reporting quarterly revenue of $396.9 million that was down marginally year-over-year despite ~8% menu pricing across its system. The weaker sales figures were related to re-franchising of a portion of its Del Taco system with company restaurant sales down over 7% year-over-year, offset by an ~8% increase in franchise-related revenue. Meanwhile, although Jack in the Box saw decent same-store sales growth of 7.9%, this was offset by underwhelming same-store sales growth at Del Taco of 1.7%, especially considering the 8.1% pricing in the period. In addition, Del Taco reported a $5.4 impairment charge in Q3, with the company noting this was attributed to underperforming restaurants in Oklahoma and Atlanta.Digging into the results a little closer, Jack in the Box saw 7.9% same-store sales growth (higher check and traffic at company-owned restaurants) and 8.0% system-wide sales growth, and noted that it saw a blowout opening for its new Salt Lake City restaurant with it representing a record-breaking opening for the company. This is certainly a positive development if other restaurants in this market can perform similarly, with 9 restaurants expected to be added in this market over the next five quarters. In addition, the company also shared that it continues to see improvements from a speed of service standpoint (12 second improvement), with its 4th consecutive quarter of lower wait times. Finally, the company's collaboration with Snoop Dogg was a hit and helped boost its late-night day part, with the increase in operating hours/staffing progress were able to support the successful execution of this promotion.Unfortunately, the results weren't nearly as strong at Del Taco, with the company limping out of the quarter with a disappointing 1.7% same-store sales figure (5.2% two-year stacked) despite pricing of 8.1%. Meanwhile, restaurant-level margins slipped to 17.4% with commodity, wage, and utility inflation, and as noted, the company recorded an impairment in the quarter related to the brand. Second, wage inflation remained elevated at 4.8%, with labor costs as a percentage of sales increasing to 34.0%. On a positive note, loyalty members were up ~200,000 to ~1.5 million, and the company has seen success in its re-franchising initiatives to create a more asset-light model, with 50 stores re-franchised (~8.5% of its system), with another 23 additional restaurants re-franchised at quarter-end, with ~66% of the total system now franchised (~54% previously).Although these results were acceptable with decent performance at Jack in the Box offset by softer results at Del Taco, the company did note that it will have to lap significant price from last year (Q3 2022 pricing was ~9% to 11%) as it heads into fiscal Q4 (set to be reported in November), and this is occurring when industry-wide traffic is taking a beating. And on capital allocation and development, the company is seeing progress for franchisee interest for its flagship Jack in the Box concept, and Del Taco re-franchises have been guided up to 90-120 for FY2023. As for capital allocation, these proceeds will be re-directed to share repurchases, with the company planning to execute ""at least"" $80 million in share repurchases this year (up from $70 million previously).Although the better margin improvement at Jack in the Box was a positive, as was its Salt Lake City performance and its confidence around up to $55,000 in savings per restaurant related to equipment, simplification/optimization, and supply chain synergies, the top-line is an area of concern for the fiscal Q4 results and potentially fiscal Q1 as well. This is because industry-wide traffic has decelerated meaningfully since July, with August and September traffic down sharply industry-wide, and October traffic off to a slow start as well, at least according to Seated Diners from OpenTable. And more importantly for Jack in the Box, quick-service traffic also fell sharply in September logging its worst month year-to-date, suggesting that even trade-down beneficiaries like quick-service and fast-casual are seeing negative traffic, which was previously a sanctuary among a period of slowing casual dining sales.The one silver lining for Jack in the Box is that its barbell menu could help to insulate it a little from this pullback. However, a more competitive environment due to increased promotional activity, more competition around late-night with Pizza Hut recently extending late-night hours to capture incremental sales in this day-part, and these brands fighting for fewer dollars as some consumers get squeezed by higher gas prices (in addition to already present headwinds from higher grocery, utility, and rent/mortgage costs), I think it's tough to be optimistic about Jack in the Box beating its top-line or bottom-line estimates ($373 million sales, $1.15 in EPS) for fiscal Q4 2023, and I don't see any reason to be overly optimistic about fiscal (CYQ4-23). And while this tougher setup might be worth ignoring if this was already priced into the stock, I don't see this as the case currently. Let's take a look at the valuation below:Based on ~20.5 million shares and a share price of $66.00, Jack in the Box trades at a market cap of ~$1.35 billion and an enterprise value of ~$4.45 billion. And while this is a significant departure from its peak market cap of ~$2.6 billion in 2021, the company still doesn't look all that undervalued, trading at ~13x FY2024 EV/EBITDA estimates, slightly above its 10-year average EV/EBITDA multiple of ~12.2x. And while this valuation might be more than justified for a high-growth name in the restaurant space with over 95% of its system being franchised with iconic brands, it's hard to argue that this is a steep undervaluation for a low-growth company with ~85% of its system franchised with two satisfactory brands.Using what I believe to be a fair multiple of 13.5x forward EV/EBITDA to account for the multiple compression we've seen across the market, I see a fair value for JACK of $74.00 per share, pointing to a 26% upside a total return basis (including dividends). However, I am looking for a minimum 30% discount to fair value for starting new positions in small-cap names to ensure a margin of safety, and ideally closer to 35% for names carrying higher levels of debt. Plus, as noted earlier, the company is in the less favorable position of having over 45% of its system in California (940+ restaurants), a state where we continue to see  that could continue to affect restaurant profitability.After applying a 30% discount to its estimated fair value of $80.00, JACK's ideal buy zone comes in at $52.00 or lower, suggesting the stock is still not in a low-risk buy zone despite its share price being nearly cut in half since its 2021 highs. This area would line up with a previous area of support for the stock from July 2022 in the $54.00 area, and a pullback to these levels would offer a better reward/risk from a technical standpoint. Obviously, I could be wrong, and it's certainly possible the stock bottoms out here after what's been a brutal correction. However, I prefer to buy at the right price or pass entirely, and with poor industry-wide traffic trends that suggest the potential for an underwhelming Q3/Q4 for most restaurants stocks and continued pressure on wages, I don't see any reason to pay up for the stock above $66.00.Jack in the Box's acquisition of Del Taco may have been accretive given that it cost no shares to significantly increase its store count and annual revenue, but it increased the company's exposure to California and could contribute to competition between the two brands due to the similarity in their markets. In addition, revenue has underperformed my expectations following the deal because of selling off company-owned stores, and FY2024 annual EPS is still expected to come in below FY2021 levels despite the growth from the Del Taco acquisition. Assuming the stock were trading below $54.00 and closer to 12x FY2024 EV/EBITDA, there might be more of an investment case here, where JACK would trade at a steeper discount to franchised peers. To summarize, while I think the valuation has become more reasonable after a ~50% correction, I don't see any margin of safety yet.

Today, I will be facilitating our Q&A session at the end of the presentation. To ask a question, simply type into the bottom of the screen. You can also ask your questions live by the operator on the phone line. [Operator Instructions]Joining us on the call are Udo Lange, CEO of Stolt-Nielsen; and Jens Gruner-Hegge, CFO.So, over to you, Udo.Thanks, Alex and good day to everyone on our Q3 earnings call. Before I talk about our positive outlook and our strong quarter, the second best EBITDA quarter in our company's history. I would like to thank our more than 7,000 employees for their excellent work and outstanding commitment to keeping us safe and delivering a superior customer experience in liquid logistics and aquaculture.I'd also like to thank our thousands of loyal customers. Without their trust in us to safely handle the business, we would not be able to achieve the results that we have seen so far this year. Since joining to Stolt-Nielsen just over a month ago, I already haveI've been equally delighted with my first customer interactions, during which they told me that we're delivering a strong customer experience centered around our perfect blendIt is a fantastic company with leading market positions, and exceptional leadership team that is implementing robust strategies that are delivering historically high financial performance in an overall attractive market environment. I am honored to join our wonderful company as the first non-family CEO after more than 60 years. I am enjoying working with Niels and his role as Chairman of Stolt-Nielsen and appreciate the trust that he and the Board have placed in me. I also look forward to working with Sam and the whole of the Stolt-Nielsen Board.Today I will begin with a short introduction about myself so that you can get to know a little bit more about my background. We will follow this with a presentation of our Group and divisional highlights. Jens will then cover the financial highlights before handing back to me for some closing remarks. Alex will then facilitate our Q&A session.As you can tell from my accent, I'm originally from Germany, but I've also spent 15 years working in the U.S. After studying economics and engineering, I completed a Ph.D. on the strategy and organization of logistics providers. Since then, I've worked in the logistics industry for more than 25 years, covering multiple aspects of supply chains. Overall, my career can be divided into two chapters. For the first 15 years, I held strategy, operational excellence, and customer experience roles on a country, regional and global level.More recently, over the past decade, I've led large global businesses ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion in revenue, a COO, President or Divisional CEO. During this time, I was able to drive significant improvements in shareholder value, employee engagement and customer experience, as well as leading several digital transformations.Most recently, I was also a member of the Senior Management Committee at FedEx, which allowed me to experience first-hand how to successfully run an iconic global company. This bottom experience, together with my recent graduation from the Harvard Advanced Management Program has prepared me perfectly for my new role here at Stolt-Nielsen.When I was approached about the role at Stolt-Nielsen, I fell in love with this opportunity, because the company and my experience, capability and passion are a perfect match. Stolt-Nielsen operates a truly global business with excellent growth potential. We have exceptional market positions in all our businesses and are delivering leading financial results within the logistics industry. This is possible because the company has a very strong people-led culture with outstanding leadership.Stolt-Nielsen fits perfectly with my previous experience and my passion for logistics and food. I believe that exceptional shareholder value is a result of a culture that has both its people and customers at its center (ph), which Stolt-Nielsen clearly has. Finally, my unwavering focus on strategy paired with straightforward execution is a perfect match to lead the next chapter of our company.I am delighted to share with you some key reasons for why I am so excited about this business and what I saw in 2022 when I was doing my research during the hiring process. In my opinion, when I look at logistics stocks, Stolt-Nielsen currently has significant shareholder value upside. We have delivered and will continue to deliver a very robust financial performance in an ongoing supportive market environment. You will hear more about this in the segment highlights. Of course, this is subject to any sudden, significant or unexpected economic or geopolitical changes.Compared to our logistics peers, we are delivering an industry-leading performance that is in my opinion not at all reflected in our comparably low PE or our stock price. With an EBITDA margin of 25.8% and ROCE of 10.4%, we are among the highest performing logistics companies. Our conversion ratio, which is defined as a percentage of gross profit that we convert to operating profit was 70%. This is a benchmark for the whole industry. It clearly illustrates the high productivity of all our businesses in supportive ongoing markets.In contrast to many other logistics companies, we are performing on a significantly elevated financial plateau compared to where we were pre-COVID. This all means that I see a very bright future ahead. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses with leading market positions, serving significant end-user markets of global chemical logistics and aquaculture. We are operating in large markets, each of which I believe has attractive growth fundamentals.I am also proud that our teams are providing customers with services and products that they generally in value as demonstrated by the many awards we received from them and the long-standing customer relationships that we have. I'm equally pleased to see that ESG plays a very important part of our strategy and safety is our top priority. At Stolt-Nielsen, we have a shared commitment to protect both people and the planet.To support this, we have a very clear goal which is to achieve zero harm across all our operations. We are signatory of the UN Global Compact and are working to reduce our environmental impact in line with the UN's sustainable development goals, responsible consumption and production, climate action and life below water. As you will have seen before, we also have clear ambitions about the impact of each of our businesses on our planet.Now to the main event of the day, the Group highlights for the quarter. I am extremely proud of what our people have accomplished this quarter. Amid an uncertain macro backdrop, we have delivered strong underlying performance compared to last quarter and Q3 last year. EBITDA came in at a very strong $201 million, a reduction compared to the record second quarter, mainly due to lower spot rates in Stolt Tankers and lower margin in Stolt Tank Containers.And if you compare the third quarter to the same period last year, we improved 9.1%. And you can clearly see our focus on execution is supported by solid market fundamentals. Thanks to the strong cash generation from our businesses and lower CapEx in the quarter. I am also very pleased to see our profitability translate to free cash flow, which increased year-on-year to $207 million from $116 million. Our focus on cash flow generation has helped us to deleverage the balance sheet, improve the net debt to EBITDA ratio, and we have managed our balance sheet by extending debt maturities.Moving on, we present a comparison of the main performance drivers year-to-date compared to this time last year. First up, Stolt Tankers. This business has continued to deliver strong results as demonstrated by the significant increase of 3.8% in sales and revenue [Technical Difficulty] compared to 2022. This is underpinned by solid fundamentals in the chemical market.Turning to Stolthaven. The utilization of our terminals has remained at high levels, close to full capacity, while we continue to focus on a strong commercial effort to secure better rates and contracts across our customer portfolio. Stolt Tank Containers had a remarkable performance in 2022 due to tight capacity from port congestion and supply chain disruptions. In 2023, we are experiencing margin pressure, but Stolt Tank Containers’ global reach gives us a competitive advantage that enables us to drive shipment volumes and gain market share.Finally, Stolt Sea Farm is executing its strategy, achieving another record quarter with EBITDA of $9.1 million. This was driven by both strong sales and production volumes supported by good prices for both turbot and sole. Ultimately, the long-term fundamentals are looking good for our businesses. On the demand side, we previously expressed uncertainty on the demand for the chemical logistics moving into the second half. We have seen in fact, summer volumes remain at robust level versus 2022.I also spent last week at a Global Chemical Industry Conference speaking to many of our customers and I believe that we should expect demand to grow slowly into 2024. On the supply side, the new building order book remains historically low, with some analysts predicting a reduce in global fleet in 2024, ‘25, depending on scrapping levels.We see a shortage of yard capacity across shipping segments with lead times well beyond what we have seen over the past decade. Placing a new build order today means that you would expect to get a vessel delivered late 2026, early 2027, so this effectively puts a cap on new stainless steel tonnage for the next two to three years.In adjacent markets, MR rates remain healthy and above recent historic levels, which continues to be supportive for swing tonnage continuing to focus on the CPP market. To summarize, on the demand side, we remain optimistic heading into winter and we continue to see favorable supply dynamics in our markets.Now, let's dive a little deeper into the performance of each of our businesses. First, we'll take a look at Stolt Tankers. I would like to start by thanking Lucas and his team for continuing to perform at a very high level. During the third quarter, we saw a softening of the chemical tanker's rates, which resulted in lower operating revenue versus last quarter.We saw Deepsea freight rates going down on average by 5.6%, although, this was partially offset by the 3.9% increase in volumes. Stolt Tankers’ regional fleets also continued to deliver strong results. Breaking the Deepsea revenue down further, quarter-on-quarter we saw spot rates fall by 14.3%. This was partially offset by a significant increase of 14.8% in spot volumes. Meanwhile, COA rates increased by 4.8%, offset by 6.9% lower volumes.Despite spot rates declining quarter-on-quarter, they remained above COA rates where we achieved an impressive sales and revenue per operating day of $28,429 during the quarter. In terms of volume mix, COA volumes represented 45% while spot was 55%. The third quarter was quite light on COA renewals, but the rates for contracts that we renewed were up 11.9 on average.EBITDA decreased quarter-on-quarter, explained by lower STJS trading results and JV income impacting up by approximately $40 million. We also saw some higher trading expenses and the higher cost of travel through the Panama Canal due to lower water levels.Moving to sailed-in rates, we have talked about softer chemical tanker spot rates during Q3 and how this has impacted our results. Sailed-in revenues were $28,429 per operating day. This was a decrease of 7.7% versus last quarter.To comment on rate development, there are three key takeaways from this slide. First, as you can see by the Clarkson Chemical Index, there has been a pick-up in spot rates moving into September. Second, whilst the sailed-in revenue is down quarter-on-quarter, the tight supply demand balance has resulted in approximately 50% higher rates this year versus the five-year average rate prior to 2023.And finally, based on the rates we have secured this quarter and our market outlook, we would indicate that the sailed-in rate for the first (ph) quarter will be up somewhere in the region of 1% to 3%. When looking at this graph, it's worth noting that a $1,000 day increase in sailed-in revenue equates to around a $6 million change in net income per quarter.In conclusion, Stolt Tankers has faced a softer market in Q3 than in Q2, but we saw a significant improvement towards the end of the quarter and are confident that our as spot market stabilize and with a strong MR market, we will continue to deliver strong results.Moving on to Stolthaven Terminals. The Terminals business continued to deliver consistent revenue growth during the quarter. Revenue was $74.7 million flat versus last quarter and up from $70.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. The improvement in revenue was mostly due to tight storage markets in the U.S. and Brazil, which enabled higher storage rates.Our wholly-owned terminals maintained a high utilization rate of 96.8%. The third quarter operating profit of $26 million decreased from the previous quarter's $27.8 million. This was mainly due to higher operating expenses and lower equity income from our joint ventures. However, when you look back to the third quarter of 2022, operating profit is up by 25% and EBITDA margin and profitability are improving quarter-on-quarter as the team works hard to fully utilize the tanks and deliver rate increases across the portfolio. Our focus is on continuing this trend. So steady as she goes for Stolthaven. Thanks to Guy and the team for the focus on commercial excellence, customer portfolio optimization and cost control.Now I'll take a closer look at Stolt Tank Containers. The team under Hans leadership have put in a great performance this quarter, despite experiencing some significant headwinds. Following an exceptional performance in 2022, the market has since returned to a more usual operating environment. During the third quarter, we saw growth in shipments, but a deterioration in margins.As anticipated in previous earnings calls, lower container rates and competition in oil markets has led to margin pressure, which impacts the revenue generated from transportation. This port congestion has eased and there have been fewer disruptions in the supply chain, we've also experienced a decrease in demurrage revenue, as customers are no longer holding on to tanks for extended periods. These factors together have led to a decline of 12.1% in operating revenue, down from $189.3 million in Q2 2023 to $166.4 million this quarter.Looking at operating costs, ocean and land freight expenses have decreased from last year's levels and our procurement teams are working diligently to secure favorable deals and freight space at competitive rates with our key vendors. Looking forward, based on our shipment and quote trackers, we believe that the transportation rates are stabilizing across most regions and currently close to the five-year average.So we do expect some softer demurrage revenues coming into Q4, owing to customers returning tanks sooner. The competitiveness of the market has clearly impacted margin, therefore we will continue to focus on expanding our market share. We will also invest in the digitalization of the business, improving our platform to better serve our customers and reduce cost.Finally, I give an update on Stolt Sea Farm, our sustainable aquaculture business. We saw strong demand for our products across all markets during the seasonally strong summer period. Volume sold were up by 6.2% quarter-to-quarter and 3% up year-to-date compared to 2022. Revenue for the third quarter was $31 million, a significant increase from $25.3 million in the same period last year. This growth was supported by an increase in sales volumes and higher prices for turbot and sole.Turbot saw prices increase of 2.9% compared to last quarter and strong demand for our sole saw average prices up 10.9% in the quarter. Our sole RAS facilities are performing exceptionally well with production levels continuing above expectations. Higher production levels have enabled us to spread costs, increases such as energy and feed costs, helping us to maintain margins.As a result, our EBITDA excluding fair value adjustment was a record $9.1 million up from $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 and up from $6.8 million last quarter. Congratulations to Jordi and the rest of the business on this impressive feat. I expect Stolt Sea Farm to continue to drive growth and profitability as they follow the strategy of increasing production capacity and focusing on expanding our sales channels and geographic reach. That's all for me on our performance for the quarter.So now, I'll hand over to Jens to take you through the financial highlights.Thank you very much, Udo. Good afternoon, everyone, and good morning to those of you listening in from the U.S. Just as a reminder, our third quarter runs from June 1 through August 31. So as Udo talked you through most of the numbers, I'll touch just on a few and I'll focus a bit more on the cash flow and how this relates to our debt levels and debt covenants. But first, just to remind you what Udo said, revenue was down due to the lower rates in STC and recently also lower spot rates in tankers, offset by improved prices and volume in Stolt Sea Farm.Operating expenses were down on the back of falling ocean freight and trucking costs and as a result, gross profit for the quarter was $256 million, down 7% from the prior quarter, but up 7% from the same quarter last year. As previously reported, in the second quarter, we recorded a loss provision of $155 million related to the MSC Flaminia lawsuit. This provision is in excess of claims covered by insurance.The net profit impact was $105 million after adjusting for an estimated tax credit of approximately $40 million and a reduction in profit share accruals of $10 million. Hence, you can see that the administrative and general expenses were very low in the second quarter reflecting this profit share reduction and that we're now back at a more regular run rate of just under $70 million per quarter.During the third quarter, we sold the Stolt- Kittiwake for a gain of $3 million and operating profit subsequently came in at $127.5 million for the quarter, down from $155.1 million in the second quarter before the Flaminia provision, but up 14% from the same quarter last year.Interest expense was down as debt levels were reduced countering the increase in interest rates. At the bottom right, you can see that our debt reduced by about $300 million over the last four quarters, while average interest rate on our debt have increased by about 1% to 5.73%.Income tax expense was $12.7 million in the quarter compared with a credit of $28.7 million in the second quarter driven by the Flaminia loss provision. In the third quarter, we also received $3.7 million in dividends on our investment in Odfjell and Golar shares. And net profit for the quarter therefore ended up at a strong $90 million with EBITDA of $201 million.Year-to-date CapEx through the third quarter was $165 million and remaining for the fourth quarter is $131 million. I expect a significant portion of this will roll over to 2024. And if you look at the 2024 amount, the SDC CapEx of $49 million is mostly related to the acquisition of new tanks. Of the CapEx scheduled for 2024, the bulk of the Stolthaven CapEx relates to the expansion of our Houston and New Orleans terminals, while the Stolt Sea Farm CapEx relates to the growth of our sole farms in Spain.As Udo mentioned, we had a strong cash flow generation during the quarter. Strong operating results drove a growing operating cash flow, together with a favorable working capital move, relative to the second quarter. The higher interest payments reflect our loans with semi-annual interest payments, after which we generated net operating cash flow of $214.1 million in the third quarter, up from $176.9 million in the second quarter.Capital expenditures during the quarter was limited as mentioned and including dry-docking payments, we ended up spending $47.6 million. During the quarter, we issued new debts secured by the Singapore terminal of just over $200 million, as well as a loan secured by our new innovative shallow draft barge Stolt Ludwigshafen.Tied to this was the retirement of the old loan on the Singapore terminal and the repayment of a bond SNI08, with $132 million. Also during the quarter, we saw a further net reduction in debt and leases of $60.3 million. This left us with a net cash flow of $97.2 million, leaving us with cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter of $212.9 million.As you can see at the bottom right, we have therefore had a total liquidity available at the end of the quarter of over $500 million when including the availability of our revolving credit lines. The continuous strong performance of the company has translated into a good performance on our various KPIs. The top two are bank covenants. The top left is showing our debt to tangible net worth, which has been on a steadily improving trend and ended the third quarter at 1.01, as the strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our debt levels.At the top right, you can see the improvement in our EBITDA to interest expense. This has been driven by the reduction in debt levels offsetting the increase in interest rates, as mentioned earlier, while the improving EBITDA has seen this ratio climb to 5.7 times. At the bottom right is our EBITDA, and in the third quarter, we produced our second highest EBITDA to date as Udo mentioned. At the bottom left, you can see that this strong EBITDA has translated into a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.65 resuming the downward trend.And with this, I would like to hand it back to you, Udo.Thank you, Jens. Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to leave you with a few concluding remarks. As you have heard today, our third quarter results reflect the strong standing of our company and the strengths of our diverse portfolio of businesses. We are pleased to report our second best EBITDA quarter in the history of our company.We believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on what seems to be positive markets for all our businesses and we remain optimistic on the winter renewal period for Stolt Tankers. Niels has previously talked about the need for both a supportive tanker market and the IPO market to be available for Stolt Tankers’ listing. Whilst we have started to see some activity in IPOs, we still view the IPO market as too soft.In addition, we want to see the IPO market appropriately valuing the tankers business. Whilst we’re continuing to monitor markets closely, as of today, we see the strong cash flows of Stolt Tankers supporting the dividends of Stolt-Nielsen rather than an IPO for the foreseeable future. During this call, I've outlined the positive outlook we have for our markets. And while it's not without some risk, we believe our businesses have unique positions in both liquid logistics and aquaculture.We have clear strategies in place, an exceptional leadership team, and are focused on executing our strategies as the best way to deliver value for our shareholders. One of the challenges that I saw before joining the company is that in my opinion, we are not rewarded for being a diversified company in attractive markets. Too often we are viewed as a shipping company only and therefore compared only to other tanker companies. This prevents Stolt-Nielsen from being valued for our quality of net profit and our position as a leader in logistics and aquaculture, which consistently pays out dividends.Two ways, I want to have the investment community to understand the true value of our company is to provide full year guidance for 2024 and invite you to our Capital Markets Day where we can deep dive into our businesses, reaffirm our strategy and explain our approach to capital allocation. We will provide more details of our Capital Market Day plans during our Q4 results.Now, I'd like to thank you for your attention and pass you back to Alex, as we open up for questions.Thank you, Udo. That completes our presentation. And now we begin the Q&A. First, I'll go to those submitted in the chat, and then we get to questions on the phone line. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.Okay. Our first questions from the online chat. One for you Udo, from Paul [indiscernible]. What do you think are the key KPIs that would decide the returns, which SNI can deliver over the next three to seven years?I think you pretty much saw that on the page that I showed as the key drivers for the business. So if you think about Stolt Tankers, of course, you're looking at the sales and revenue that we have for the business. When you think about our Sea Farm business, of course, it's the prices and the tonnage that we're achieving there. If you think about our Terminals business, of course, you want to have a high utilization at a nice price level. And finally, our Tank Container business is really a network business. So you're looking at volume growth and high asset utilization.And what I'm really excited, I joined the company, and if there's one thing which is happening at Stolt-Nielsen, it's detailed KPI management across all businesses. We have BI management dashboards in each area and each business leader and each operator down in the field has on their fingertips at any point in time, what are the key success drivers in the business and I was so excited to see this Alex. It's just a wonderful company which has embraced digitalization to drive performance.Thank you, Udo. Next question goes to [indiscernible].Hi. The 11.9% higher COA rates. How does that compare to Q2 2023 or Q3 2022?As we go on, you will have this measure of COA increases. It's always back to the same quarter that was 12 months ago. So as we continue to renew our contracts, you will expect that the COA increases will decline. That being said, in the second quarter, the COA increase was 55% and in the first quarter of 2023, we're at 53%. If you go back to the third quarter of 2022, I seem to recall we were in the region of about 10%.Thank you, Jens. Thank you. Congrats for the numbers. Okay. So next question is to Udo, from [indiscernible]. Can you elaborate on your record low COA ratio? Is there any level that you deem too low?Hi, Ivan. Thank you so much for that question. I think we need to think about the COA and spot quotes a little bit differently. The COA to spot quote ratio is really a mirror, how you are executing a strategy in the market and what is the market allowing you to do. So I think the team is picking right now the right strategy because you have a high volume of spot quotes, which are coming in at nice price levels. And on the other hand the COA level in pricing has not yet fully picked up. We are seeing increases now and I expect we continue to see increases in the winter season as part of the renewals.But we need to have that rate level on COA increase, so that it overall shifts more back. So there's really not this -- oh this is the optimal mix. It's the optimal mix in the market environment that you are in and I have confidence that Lucas and the team are executing that in a perfect way. And yeah, it appears low and we expect to increase COA going forward, but it's really our customers, who also decide if they want to pay the higher spot quote prices, while maybe it is prudent to agree to higher COA rates at this point in time.Very good. Thank you. And then the next question we have comes from David [indiscernible] and it relates to Avenir. The question he has is that the gas market is good, but what do you see the prospects for Avenir going forward?Thank you so much, David. Of course, with our commitment to ESG, we are really excited that we have a business like Avenir in our portfolio. And Peter Mackey and his team are doing excellent work in bringing our business forward in this space. So, of course, at the end, this is a question of how is the LNG price developing versus what is happening on fossil fuels. But if you see, how many dual fuel ships are coming into the market in the coming years, I think there's a very bright future ahead for LNG. And we are the center of this bright future with our Avenir business.Very good. Thank you very much. So that concludes the Q&A. I'll pass it back to you.Yeah. Thank you so much for joining us today. I look forward to talking to you again in the new year when we present our fourth quarter. Again, thank you and wish you all a good day.",0,2023-10-05T13:00:05.000-04:00

It clearly illustrates the high productivity of all our businesses in supportive ongoing markets.In contrast to many other logistics companies, we are performing on a significantly elevated financial plateau compared to where we were pre-COVID. This all means that I see a very bright future ahead. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses with leading market positions, serving significant end-user markets of global chemical logistics and aquaculture. We are operating in large markets, each of which I believe has attractive growth fundamentals.I am also proud that our teams are providing customers with services and products that they generally in value as demonstrated by the many awards we received from them and the long-standing customer relationships that we have. I'm equally pleased to see that ESG plays a very important part of our strategy and safety is our top priority. At Stolt-Nielsen, we have a shared commitment to protect both people and the planet.To support this, we have a very clear goal which is to achieve zero harm across all our operations. We are signatory of the UN Global Compact and are working to reduce our environmental impact in line with the UN's sustainable development goals, responsible consumption and production, climate action and life below water. As you will have seen before, we also have clear ambitions about the impact of each of our businesses on our planet.Now to the main event of the day, the Group highlights for the quarter. I am extremely proud of what our people have accomplished this quarter. Amid an uncertain macro backdrop, we have delivered strong underlying performance compared to last quarter and Q3 last year. EBITDA came in at a very strong $201 million, a reduction compared to the record second quarter, mainly due to lower spot rates in Stolt Tankers and lower margin in Stolt Tank Containers.And if you compare the third quarter to the same period last year, we improved 9.1%. And you can clearly see our focus on execution is supported by solid market fundamentals. Thanks to the strong cash generation from our businesses and lower CapEx in the quarter. I am also very pleased to see our profitability translate to free cash flow, which increased year-on-year to $207 million from $116 million. Our focus on cash flow generation has helped us to deleverage the balance sheet, improve the net debt to EBITDA ratio, and we have managed our balance sheet by extending debt maturities.Moving on, we present a comparison of the main performance drivers year-to-date compared to this time last year. First up, Stolt Tankers. This business has continued to deliver strong results as demonstrated by the significant increase of 3.8% in sales and revenue [Technical Difficulty] compared to 2022. This is underpinned by solid fundamentals in the chemical market.Turning to Stolthaven. The utilization of our terminals has remained at high levels, close to full capacity, while we continue to focus on a strong commercial effort to secure better rates and contracts across our customer portfolio. Stolt Tank Containers had a remarkable performance in 2022 due to tight capacity from port congestion and supply chain disruptions. In 2023, we are experiencing margin pressure, but Stolt Tank Containers’ global reach gives us a competitive advantage that enables us to drive shipment volumes and gain market share.Finally, Stolt Sea Farm is executing its strategy, achieving another record quarter with EBITDA of $9.1 million. This was driven by both strong sales and production volumes supported by good prices for both turbot and sole. Ultimately, the long-term fundamentals are looking good for our businesses. On the demand side, we previously expressed uncertainty on the demand for the chemical logistics moving into the second half. We have seen in fact, summer volumes remain at robust level versus 2022.I also spent last week at a Global Chemical Industry Conference speaking to many of our customers and I believe that we should expect demand to grow slowly into 2024. On the supply side, the new building order book remains historically low, with some analysts predicting a reduce in global fleet in 2024, ‘25, depending on scrapping levels.We see a shortage of yard capacity across shipping segments with lead times well beyond what we have seen over the past decade. Placing a new build order today means that you would expect to get a vessel delivered late 2026, early 2027, so this effectively puts a cap on new stainless steel tonnage for the next two to three years.In adjacent markets, MR rates remain healthy and above recent historic levels, which continues to be supportive for swing tonnage continuing to focus on the CPP market. To summarize, on the demand side, we remain optimistic heading into winter and we continue to see favorable supply dynamics in our markets.Now, let's dive a little deeper into the performance of each of our businesses. First, we'll take a look at Stolt Tankers. I would like to start by thanking Lucas and his team for continuing to perform at a very high level. During the third quarter, we saw a softening of the chemical tanker's rates, which resulted in lower operating revenue versus last quarter.We saw Deepsea freight rates going down on average by 5.6%, although, this was partially offset by the 3.9% increase in volumes. Stolt Tankers’ regional fleets also continued to deliver strong results. Breaking the Deepsea revenue down further, quarter-on-quarter we saw spot rates fall by 14.3%. This was partially offset by a significant increase of 14.8% in spot volumes. Meanwhile, COA rates increased by 4.8%, offset by 6.9% lower volumes.Despite spot rates declining quarter-on-quarter, they remained above COA rates where we achieved an impressive sales and revenue per operating day of $28,429 during the quarter. In terms of volume mix, COA volumes represented 45% while spot was 55%. The third quarter was quite light on COA renewals, but the rates for contracts that we renewed were up 11.9 on average.EBITDA decreased quarter-on-quarter, explained by lower STJS trading results and JV income impacting up by approximately $40 million. We also saw some higher trading expenses and the higher cost of travel through the Panama Canal due to lower water levels.Moving to sailed-in rates, we have talked about softer chemical tanker spot rates during Q3 and how this has impacted our results. Sailed-in revenues were $28,429 per operating day. This was a decrease of 7.7% versus last quarter.To comment on rate development, there are three key takeaways from this slide. First, as you can see by the Clarkson Chemical Index, there has been a pick-up in spot rates moving into September. Second, whilst the sailed-in revenue is down quarter-on-quarter, the tight supply demand balance has resulted in approximately 50% higher rates this year versus the five-year average rate prior to 2023.And finally, based on the rates we have secured this quarter and our market outlook, we would indicate that the sailed-in rate for the first (ph) quarter will be up somewhere in the region of 1% to 3%. When looking at this graph, it's worth noting that a $1,000 day increase in sailed-in revenue equates to around a $6 million change in net income per quarter.In conclusion, Stolt Tankers has faced a softer market in Q3 than in Q2, but we saw a significant improvement towards the end of the quarter and are confident that our as spot market stabilize and with a strong MR market, we will continue to deliver strong results.Moving on to Stolthaven Terminals. The Terminals business continued to deliver consistent revenue growth during the quarter. Revenue was $74.7 million flat versus last quarter and up from $70.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. The improvement in revenue was mostly due to tight storage markets in the U.S. and Brazil, which enabled higher storage rates.Our wholly-owned terminals maintained a high utilization rate of 96.8%. The third quarter operating profit of $26 million decreased from the previous quarter's $27.8 million. This was mainly due to higher operating expenses and lower equity income from our joint ventures. However, when you look back to the third quarter of 2022, operating profit is up by 25% and EBITDA margin and profitability are improving quarter-on-quarter as the team works hard to fully utilize the tanks and deliver rate increases across the portfolio. Our focus is on continuing this trend. So steady as she goes for Stolthaven. Thanks to Guy and the team for the focus on commercial excellence, customer portfolio optimization and cost control.Now I'll take a closer look at Stolt Tank Containers. The team under Hans leadership have put in a great performance this quarter, despite experiencing some significant headwinds. Following an exceptional performance in 2022, the market has since returned to a more usual operating environment. During the third quarter, we saw growth in shipments, but a deterioration in margins.As anticipated in previous earnings calls, lower container rates and competition in oil markets has led to margin pressure, which impacts the revenue generated from transportation. This port congestion has eased and there have been fewer disruptions in the supply chain, we've also experienced a decrease in demurrage revenue, as customers are no longer holding on to tanks for extended periods. These factors together have led to a decline of 12.1% in operating revenue, down from $189.3 million in Q2 2023 to $166.4 million this quarter.Looking at operating costs, ocean and land freight expenses have decreased from last year's levels and our procurement teams are working diligently to secure favorable deals and freight space at competitive rates with our key vendors. Looking forward, based on our shipment and quote trackers, we believe that the transportation rates are stabilizing across most regions and currently close to the five-year average.So we do expect some softer demurrage revenues coming into Q4, owing to customers returning tanks sooner. The competitiveness of the market has clearly impacted margin, therefore we will continue to focus on expanding our market share. We will also invest in the digitalization of the business, improving our platform to better serve our customers and reduce cost.Finally, I give an update on Stolt Sea Farm, our sustainable aquaculture business. We saw strong demand for our products across all markets during the seasonally strong summer period. Volume sold were up by 6.2% quarter-to-quarter and 3% up year-to-date compared to 2022. Revenue for the third quarter was $31 million, a significant increase from $25.3 million in the same period last year. This growth was supported by an increase in sales volumes and higher prices for turbot and sole.Turbot saw prices increase of 2.9% compared to last quarter and strong demand for our sole saw average prices up 10.9% in the quarter. Our sole RAS facilities are performing exceptionally well with production levels continuing above expectations. Higher production levels have enabled us to spread costs, increases such as energy and feed costs, helping us to maintain margins.As a result, our EBITDA excluding fair value adjustment was a record $9.1 million up from $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 and up from $6.8 million last quarter. Congratulations to Jordi and the rest of the business on this impressive feat. I expect Stolt Sea Farm to continue to drive growth and profitability as they follow the strategy of increasing production capacity and focusing on expanding our sales channels and geographic reach. That's all for me on our performance for the quarter.So now, I'll hand over to Jens to take you through the financial highlights.Thank you very much, Udo. Good afternoon, everyone, and good morning to those of you listening in from the U.S. Just as a reminder, our third quarter runs from June 1 through August 31. So as Udo talked you through most of the numbers, I'll touch just on a few and I'll focus a bit more on the cash flow and how this relates to our debt levels and debt covenants. But first, just to remind you what Udo said, revenue was down due to the lower rates in STC and recently also lower spot rates in tankers, offset by improved prices and volume in Stolt Sea Farm.Operating expenses were down on the back of falling ocean freight and trucking costs and as a result, gross profit for the quarter was $256 million, down 7% from the prior quarter, but up 7% from the same quarter last year. As previously reported, in the second quarter, we recorded a loss provision of $155 million related to the MSC Flaminia lawsuit. This provision is in excess of claims covered by insurance.The net profit impact was $105 million after adjusting for an estimated tax credit of approximately $40 million and a reduction in profit share accruals of $10 million. Hence, you can see that the administrative and general expenses were very low in the second quarter reflecting this profit share reduction and that we're now back at a more regular run rate of just under $70 million per quarter.During the third quarter, we sold the Stolt- Kittiwake for a gain of $3 million and operating profit subsequently came in at $127.5 million for the quarter, down from $155.1 million in the second quarter before the Flaminia provision, but up 14% from the same quarter last year.Interest expense was down as debt levels were reduced countering the increase in interest rates. At the bottom right, you can see that our debt reduced by about $300 million over the last four quarters, while average interest rate on our debt have increased by about 1% to 5.73%.Income tax expense was $12.7 million in the quarter compared with a credit of $28.7 million in the second quarter driven by the Flaminia loss provision. In the third quarter, we also received $3.7 million in dividends on our investment in Odfjell and Golar shares. And net profit for the quarter therefore ended up at a strong $90 million with EBITDA of $201 million.Year-to-date CapEx through the third quarter was $165 million and remaining for the fourth quarter is $131 million. I expect a significant portion of this will roll over to 2024. And if you look at the 2024 amount, the SDC CapEx of $49 million is mostly related to the acquisition of new tanks. Of the CapEx scheduled for 2024, the bulk of the Stolthaven CapEx relates to the expansion of our Houston and New Orleans terminals, while the Stolt Sea Farm CapEx relates to the growth of our sole farms in Spain.As Udo mentioned, we had a strong cash flow generation during the quarter. Strong operating results drove a growing operating cash flow, together with a favorable working capital move, relative to the second quarter. The higher interest payments reflect our loans with semi-annual interest payments, after which we generated net operating cash flow of $214.1 million in the third quarter, up from $176.9 million in the second quarter.Capital expenditures during the quarter was limited as mentioned and including dry-docking payments, we ended up spending $47.6 million. During the quarter, we issued new debts secured by the Singapore terminal of just over $200 million, as well as a loan secured by our new innovative shallow draft barge Stolt Ludwigshafen.Tied to this was the retirement of the old loan on the Singapore terminal and the repayment of a bond SNI08, with $132 million. Also during the quarter, we saw a further net reduction in debt and leases of $60.3 million. This left us with a net cash flow of $97.2 million, leaving us with cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter of $212.9 million.As you can see at the bottom right, we have therefore had a total liquidity available at the end of the quarter of over $500 million when including the availability of our revolving credit lines. The continuous strong performance of the company has translated into a good performance on our various KPIs. The top two are bank covenants. The top left is showing our debt to tangible net worth, which has been on a steadily improving trend and ended the third quarter at 1.01, as the strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our debt levels.At the top right, you can see the improvement in our EBITDA to interest expense. This has been driven by the reduction in debt levels offsetting the increase in interest rates, as mentioned earlier, while the improving EBITDA has seen this ratio climb to 5.7 times. At the bottom right is our EBITDA, and in the third quarter, we produced our second highest EBITDA to date as Udo mentioned. At the bottom left, you can see that this strong EBITDA has translated into a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.65 resuming the downward trend.And with this, I would like to hand it back to you, Udo.Thank you, Jens. Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to leave you with a few concluding remarks. As you have heard today, our third quarter results reflect the strong standing of our company and the strengths of our diverse portfolio of businesses. We are pleased to report our second best EBITDA quarter in the history of our company.We believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on what seems to be positive markets for all our businesses and we remain optimistic on the winter renewal period for Stolt Tankers. Niels has previously talked about the need for both a supportive tanker market and the IPO market to be available for Stolt Tankers’ listing. Whilst we have started to see some activity in IPOs, we still view the IPO market as too soft.In addition, we want to see the IPO market appropriately valuing the tankers business. Whilst we’re continuing to monitor markets closely, as of today, we see the strong cash flows of Stolt Tankers supporting the dividends of Stolt-Nielsen rather than an IPO for the foreseeable future. During this call, I've outlined the positive outlook we have for our markets. And while it's not without some risk, we believe our businesses have unique positions in both liquid logistics and aquaculture.We have clear strategies in place, an exceptional leadership team, and are focused on executing our strategies as the best way to deliver value for our shareholders. One of the challenges that I saw before joining the company is that in my opinion, we are not rewarded for being a diversified company in attractive markets. Too often we are viewed as a shipping company only and therefore compared only to other tanker companies. This prevents Stolt-Nielsen from being valued for our quality of net profit and our position as a leader in logistics and aquaculture, which consistently pays out dividends.Two ways, I want to have the investment community to understand the true value of our company is to provide full year guidance for 2024 and invite you to our Capital Markets Day where we can deep dive into our businesses, reaffirm our strategy and explain our approach to capital allocation. We will provide more details of our Capital Market Day plans during our Q4 results.Now, I'd like to thank you for your attention and pass you back to Alex, as we open up for questions.Thank you, Udo. That completes our presentation. And now we begin the Q&A. First, I'll go to those submitted in the chat, and then we get to questions on the phone line. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.Okay. Our first questions from the online chat. One for you Udo, from Paul [indiscernible]. What do you think are the key KPIs that would decide the returns, which SNI can deliver over the next three to seven years?I think you pretty much saw that on the page that I showed as the key drivers for the business. So if you think about Stolt Tankers, of course, you're looking at the sales and revenue that we have for the business. When you think about our Sea Farm business, of course, it's the prices and the tonnage that we're achieving there. If you think about our Terminals business, of course, you want to have a high utilization at a nice price level. And finally, our Tank Container business is really a network business. So you're looking at volume growth and high asset utilization.And what I'm really excited, I joined the company, and if there's one thing which is happening at Stolt-Nielsen, it's detailed KPI management across all businesses. We have BI management dashboards in each area and each business leader and each operator down in the field has on their fingertips at any point in time, what are the key success drivers in the business and I was so excited to see this Alex. It's just a wonderful company which has embraced digitalization to drive performance.Thank you, Udo. Next question goes to [indiscernible].Hi. The 11.9% higher COA rates. How does that compare to Q2 2023 or Q3 2022?As we go on, you will have this measure of COA increases. It's always back to the same quarter that was 12 months ago. So as we continue to renew our contracts, you will expect that the COA increases will decline. That being said, in the second quarter, the COA increase was 55% and in the first quarter of 2023, we're at 53%. If you go back to the third quarter of 2022, I seem to recall we were in the region of about 10%.Thank you, Jens. Thank you. Congrats for the numbers. Okay. So next question is to Udo, from [indiscernible]. Can you elaborate on your record low COA ratio? Is there any level that you deem too low?Hi, Ivan. Thank you so much for that question. I think we need to think about the COA and spot quotes a little bit differently. The COA to spot quote ratio is really a mirror, how you are executing a strategy in the market and what is the market allowing you to do. So I think the team is picking right now the right strategy because you have a high volume of spot quotes, which are coming in at nice price levels. And on the other hand the COA level in pricing has not yet fully picked up. We are seeing increases now and I expect we continue to see increases in the winter season as part of the renewals.But we need to have that rate level on COA increase, so that it overall shifts more back. So there's really not this -- oh this is the optimal mix. It's the optimal mix in the market environment that you are in and I have confidence that Lucas and the team are executing that in a perfect way. And yeah, it appears low and we expect to increase COA going forward, but it's really our customers, who also decide if they want to pay the higher spot quote prices, while maybe it is prudent to agree to higher COA rates at this point in time.Very good. Thank you. And then the next question we have comes from David [indiscernible] and it relates to Avenir. The question he has is that the gas market is good, but what do you see the prospects for Avenir going forward?Thank you so much, David. Of course, with our commitment to ESG, we are really excited that we have a business like Avenir in our portfolio. And Peter Mackey and his team are doing excellent work in bringing our business forward in this space. So, of course, at the end, this is a question of how is the LNG price developing versus what is happening on fossil fuels. But if you see, how many dual fuel ships are coming into the market in the coming years, I think there's a very bright future ahead for LNG. And we are the center of this bright future with our Avenir business.Very good. Thank you very much. So that concludes the Q&A. I'll pass it back to you.Yeah. Thank you so much for joining us today. I look forward to talking to you again in the new year when we present our fourth quarter. Again, thank you and wish you all a good day.",0,2023-10-05T13:00:05.000-04:00
ConocoPhillips: A Value-Rich Energy Operator,"The energy sector is increasingly complex as a result of the expansion of sources and categories of production. The advent of energy sources has split the space into traditional, fossil fuels (non-renewables) and the renewable entrants, including electric, wind and solar.This shifting environment also impacts investors’ considerations and investment choices. Energy companies that are linked to fossil fuel production must pass a higher bar in the current environment. We already see companies turning to activities such as carbon conversion to adjust to a renewables-focused future.A traditional operator such as ConocoPhillips () must factor these macro trends in its thinking. COP has worked on increasing efficiency to maximize future revenues and profits. It clearly believes that non-renewable energy will remain in strong demand for years to come.ConocoPhillips (COP) is a fairly COP owns a relatively low-cost portfolio but with inherent flexibility to exploit tactical opportunities. Company leadership has demonstrated that it can and will deploy fiscal strength smartly if the right scenario arises.ConocoPhillips has implemented a strategic 10-year plan that rests on multiple pillars: Restrained investment, steady growth, better returns and returning cash consistently to shareholders.The company intends to maintain capital spending at about $11 billion per year while returning 30% of operating cash flow to shareholders. It seeks to accomplish this combination of prudent spending and healthy shareholder returns via: 1) Share buybacks 2) an ordinary annual dividend and 3) a variable component. In my view, the variable component is where investments tied to rising energy price environments come into play through mechanisms such as agreements.* is an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer's upcoming goods.Another aspect of COP’s business plan includes an emphasis on - specifically in the Permian Basin, its largest resource position via the purchase of Concho Resources and shale assets from Shell’s Permian holdings.*Companies may obtain conventional energy by  such as extracting from oil shale, shale gas and deepwater oil.Outside of the Permian, COP holds steady production levels from Bakken and Eagle Ford holdings. Eagle Ford, while less than 30% of the approximately 700,000 acres in the Permian under the COP flag, features high-return oil and liquids. The Bakken includes 560,000 acres.  than the Permian sources.COP also owns significant Alaska and Canada acreage that offer real promise - it expects significant growth in Alaska. In addition, COP is involved in Qatar LNG expansion work and producing LNG in Texas (Port Arthur). A large Australian LNG resource is APLNG, or The Qatar LNG is first-quality, while the Australian LNG production is appealing for its projected ability to drive massive sales to Asian customers for many years. Together, the two sources should drive COP LNG production close to 300 mboe/d by decade’s end. means one thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.COP has improved its portfolio through cost reductions and sales of assets and through low-cost, non-conventional product growth. Adding Permian resources bumped up the high-quality side of the COP portfolio. While production has been flat for the past nine years, divesting natural gas and shifting the emphasis to higher-margin crude (up to 53% from 39) enhances profits.Add in off-take agreements such as the Saguaro site in western Mexico, and a picture of diverse production emerges within the strategic plan.A combination of strategic planning, cost-consciousness and resource/field diversity create an attractive, compelling business case for potential investors.On Aug. 3, COP Chairman and  to discuss the company’s second quarter earnings. The report was generally positive and the crop of analysts on the call asked a number of relevant and challenging questions of Mr. Lance and his team.Ryan Lance began by referring to the strategic 10-year plan, which had its official kickoff this past April, and noted how the plan guided COP decisions even quarter-by-quarter:Having a long-term plan as a reference for a bevy of current actions and decisions is, in my view, a great advantage for COP. Lance then delved into specific company moves in regards to resource holdings, specifically Surmont in Alberta, Canada:Ryan Lance also addressed the role of global LNG in COP’s operations, which shows resource diversification and how its commercialization should impact ConocoPhillips and its bottom line:This statement demonstrates the scope of COP’s LNG expansion as well as its use of joint ventures and off-take deals that brighten the palette of LNG revenue sources.The CEO addressed second quarter performance, including a raise in full-year production guidance based on capital efficiency improvements. Lance emphasized focus on return-focused value and distribution of $5.8 billion through dividends and buybacks year-to-date .The company’s Executive V-P and CFO, William Bullock highlighted cost cutting in a step-down in capex for 2023:Guidance also was conservative:As with any useful earnings report call, the most compelling portion is often the Q & A that provides give-and-take between Wall Street analysts and company leaders. Analysts asked about , ,and .Executive V-P Dominic Macklon addressed :Macklon was asked whether COP would be increasing its dividend in the wake of the enormous cash flow benefit ($1 billion) from the Surmont property. The answer was ""no"" with consideration of a dividend raise in the future.He also handled a query about  in the energy sector. Macklon confirmed that production costs in the Lower 48 had fallen:Questions about LNG strategy and expansion, clearly a recent focus, fell mostly to CFO Bullock.COP mixes expansion of properties in the Permian with cost-efficient production in static (in terms of size) Bakken and Eagle Ford. It invests in fields from Canada to Qatar to Australia, combining high-quality production (Qatar) with lower quality fields (Australia) whose primary advantage is proximity to ""thirsty"" Asian markets. The company also is nimble enough to apply its balance sheet resources to deals like the off-take agreement with the Saguaro facility in Mexico.Company leadership is direct and no-nonsense. I detect an absence of hype along with pragmatic execution of an intelligent long-term strategy.Let’s first consider  for COP:Doubling shares in this period of time is solid performance. Current company improvements suggest a strong possibility of enhanced returns over the next several years.Next, we will look at revenues and earnings per share, both historic and near-term-future projections:Lumpiness exists for both measures, with the revenue levels varying considerably. Yet 2023 and 2024 full-year projections are positive and above those of most previous years (save 2022).For EPS, the chart displays a much shorter time (as against five years for revenues). The projections are modestly encouraging for ’23-’24.A combined look at some standard metrics follows:Valuation falls into the mediocre range for energy companies. Growth, including levered FCS, has disappointed and casts some doubt on earnings call statements.is exceptional, earning the rare Seeking Alpha A+. Share price momentum gets a B- and exceeds the S&P 500 average momentum (3x for the past year).Finally, let’s take a look at the ConocoPhillips :Combined metric categories produce a nice 7 of 10 for COP.The useful packaged in the Altman Z-score and Beneish M-score are reassuring to those with lower risk appetites.On the profitability side, gross margins are somewhat anemic compared to industry rivals; remaining metrics are good and green.ConocoPhillips risk factors include:I see COP strategy as quite sound, diversified and conservative. Issues with production or revenues tied to specific resources should be minor in nature. Target markets seem well understood, and fluctuations in demand should be minimized by smart logistical implementations such as ""partnering"" specific assets with markets. The best example may be Australian LNG at high production rates able to be delivered swiftly to Asian customers.Energy prices may remain high into the foreseeable future. Just as relevantly, ConocoPhillips emphasis on strategic low-cost production will mitigate any macro price declines.The risk of COP suffering from the ongoing transition to renewable energy sources accelerates is real. Nonetheless, I see a continued strong demand for traditional (even if unpopular) sources of energy for years to come.The 10-year plan is a strong one. It's diversified and provides an umbrella or within which flexible tactical decisions may occur. COP has already shown how it takes cash flows and deploys them in off-take agreements as with Saguaro in Mexico.I do not expect significant C-suite changes any time soon. Based on the content of the Q2 earnings call, company leadership appears well-rounded, determined and hard-nosed.When I thought about a rating for ConocoPhillips before researching the company, I would have guessed a would emerge.My look into COP, its structure, strategic planning and execution, leadership and philosophy changed that. I would recommend COP as a for investors willing to hold shares for three-to-five years.While I do not own any COP personally, I am considering adding shares to my personal portfolio.

Our Contract Logistics Group navigated late-quarter market disruption with outstanding performance, while headwinds continue to hamper our intermodal and brokerage segment. Our Truckload segment outperformed expectations with a strong showing from its specialized services group. I am extremely proud of our employees, contractors and agents who continue to provide superior customer service to our diversified customer base. While individual segments of ULH are facing various challenges, our experienced management team has been able to adjust and shine the light on best practices with the path forward for our associates and customers.We continue to make headway inOur Transportation & Logistics segment performance looked very similar to Q2 with Transportation continuing to experience the adverse impact of inventory destocking as customer demand for goods remains tempered. Falling in line with demand, transportation pricing also remains under pressure with our transactional business still bumping what we hope is at or near the bottom of the cycle.Our Contract Logistics segment has continued to see a good flow of new opportunity and have not experienced the same level of rate compression that our brokerage, intermodal and truckload groups that have experience. Leadership remains focused on evaluating and supplying our customers with the best pricing while keeping a keen eye on continued quality commitments in an inflationary environment. Our diversified operating footprint continues to produce balanced operating results. Contract Logistics and the variable cost agent-based truckload model delivered great results.We remain confident in the foundation of our intermodal and brokerage segment. We are pulling levers while searching for additional cost containment and savings under the current market conditions. Our pipeline of new customer prospects remains robust as well as the cross-selling initiatives with current customers. Our sales team has worked extremely hard identifying these customers and introducing new services. We are extremely pleased with the synergies we have found by linking services.Universal remains committed to providing our bad customers with superior service across multiple platforms helping them gain better control of their supply chain. The outlook for autos and Class 8 trucks remains optimistic. While there is some near-term uncertainty with labor and pressure from rising interest rates, production forecast remains stable. Diversification continues to be a theme for all of our operating sectors as it will provide additional balance and new growth opportunities. We remain committed to climb out of the freight recession as import numbers remain muted and domestic freight volumes are restricted. Discipline and execution are critical over the next several quarters.Now for the quarter. In yesterday’s release, Universal reported 2023 third quarter earnings of $0.88 per share on total operating revenue of $421.3 million. Both operating margin and revenue were in line with our Q3 forecast. Q3 2022 offered tough comparison as it was Universal’s best operating margin and EPS ever.Now for some color on each of our service lines. In our Contract Logistics segment, the number of active value-added programs continued to increase and finish the quarter at 73 programs. Interest in our customer-centric value-added programs continues to grow across a variety of industry verticals. We are confident and eager to display our existing solutions and processes to new customers who are looking for operational efficiencies, tech solutions and cost base. Other than a few strike restricted facilities, auto production remained consistent through Q3, but with a sporadic 6-day work week. We did experience some loss of volume at the end of the quarter due to our operations matching up with the auto facilities that are on strike. We are actively watching and remain nimble to any developments affecting production. The SAR remained elevated over the same quarter last year.The outcome of Q4 production will be influenced by the resolution of the ongoing strike at the three American auto manufacturers. 2023 Class 8 production levels continue to exceed 2022 volumes, with a forecasted production strength for the remainder of the year. 2023 Class 8 production should be in the neighborhood of 336,000 units versus 315,000 units in 2022. While there are some disruptions due to part shortages, production volumes at the plants we service surpassed Q3 2022 production volume. We are closely monitoring the ongoing negotiations between Mack Mobile and the UAW.We are excited about our pipeline that continues to remain full of opportunities in various industry verticals. We have remained busy launching several new pieces of business in Q3 and had several more launching in Q4. An October launch will support operations for an automotive manufacturer in mid-Mexico. Universal remains focused on the opportunities that Mexico presents. Nearshoring trends have now elevated Mexico as United States’ largest import trading partner.The Dedicated Transportation Group continues to onboard new business and execute taking advantage of a high-volume platform to satisfy complex and demanding inbound material environment. We continue to highlight our velocity model, which is a fabulous entry into additional opportunities for existing customers and a great case study for new customers looking for the next level of execution and service.Revenue for the quarter was up slightly, but same facility sales were down as a result of softer revenue in the automotive space. a lack of 6-day service and a few part disruptions were to blame for the reduced revenue. Offsetting this were a few new business wins. Dedicated also spent the latter half of the third quarter, preparing for a major launch in Mexico at the beginning of October. We are extremely excited about adding to our density in mid Mexico. We were successful in obtaining new trucks and trailers to support the customer and expect this to be entry into additional business in the region. The program will layer in over a 5-week period and be supported by 40 drivers and 60 trailers. At full run rate, this new business is expected to generate approximately $6 million in annual revenue.This opportunity is a great example of multiple universal service lines working together to create additional value for our customers. The dedicated group will round out Q4 with a major launch in the Southeastern U.S. for a manufacturer of agricultural equipment. Preparation is underway to support the facility housing over 20 drivers and a large pool of trailing equipment. We expect to be launched and at full run rate in Q1 of 2024. Our intermodal drayage group continues to navigate a restricted import environment. We did see a slight seasonal bump in the quarter, but nothing that could be considered peak. U.S. import volumes remain muted at most major ports as shippers continue their inventory destocking cycle.The narrative among many shippers remains the same. They are very hesitant to predict the next two quarters as they continue to dive in on the customers’ appetite to spend. We’ve had conversations with some major discount retailers who expect a slight uptick in volume with many industrial customers expecting flat to orders being down. The sluggish import environment continued to restrict overall load volumes in the quarter, which fell 11.8% and contribute to a 43.9% and decline in top line revenue over the same period of 2022.Accessorial charges continued their steep decrease as ocean volumes remained in a deficit and supply chains were fluid. Accessorial charges declined over 68% or $21.4 million. The average revenue per load ex fuel was down 24.7% to $547 per load as the market remained extremely competitive.Intermodal’s California operations continue to be a drag on the segment’s overall financial results. While non-California operations operate profitably, albeit at reduced margins. California load volumes remained depressed, down 13.6% over the same period in 2022, and while revenue per load was down 35.6%, which contributed to a 57% decrease in operating revenue. While we are confident in our continued effort to rightsize and optimize the fleet, freight volumes and pricing will play a part in that equation. Losses in Southern California affected our overall EPS by $0.19 per share.We remain optimistic about our growing intermodal pipeline, while there is an abundant amount of opportunity, the pricing is extremely competitive. Q3 proved to be a successful quarter for launching new business. We had 10 new projects with various customers. onboarded and launched in Q3 and expect positive impacts of load count in the coming months. The group will continue streamlining of operations and evaluating cost control initiatives while focusing on servicing our customer base. And preparing for the climb when volumes increase.Van and flatbed headwinds continued in Q3 for our Trucking segment, but wind transportation experienced a 15.6% uptick in loads for the quarter. Metals, industrial, retail and consumer goods volumes were down – were all down year-over-year. Overall, load count was down 13.1% and but the rise in wind volumes led to a 13.3% increase in revenue per load. Our agent-based brokerage experienced a significant drop off in brokerage load which were down over 25.6% compared to 2022. Top line revenue of $97.1 million was down 2.5% for the quarter while operating income increased $1.8 million to $6.6 million compared to $4.8 million last year. While core flatbed and van volumes remain a challenge, the variable cost structure model provided consistent returns.Our truckload model continues to provide agents with tools and leadership to grow the business. We’re excited about the prospects in our pipeline and are eager to continue to launch talent into the system. We remain diligent on finding and onboarding new agents and customers. Company-managed brokerage saw top line revenue dropped 30.8% in the quarter to $28.1 million as sluggish freight market influenced by inflation and customer – consumer spending continued to drive down pricing.The group is experiencing many potential opportunities that has remained disciplined with pricing. Many opportunities are at or below breakeven from a profit standpoint. We continue to align our pricing and selection of freight to give the operations team the best opportunity to make money on everything we do. We are not interested in pricing freight to increase volume at a substantial loss. Depressed pricing, coupled with increased carrier operational costs has made the model very difficult to reach gross margin expectations. However, you are beginning to see some of the fallout in the space because of margin compression. Operating revenue per load decreased 11.1% to $1,475 per load, and the load count was down 12.3%. Gross margin increased over Q2 2023, but was well below Q3 of 2022. The third-party capacity is available, but it is coming at a higher cost because of inflation.We continue to remain extremely optimistic about our future. while near-term inventory and inflation issues have created some obstacles, our road map to diversification and growth is measurable. Our sales pipeline across all segments is healthy, our contract logistics offerings continue to show well and spark enthusiasm with potential and existing customers. Adding value to our customer supply chain is our number one priority.Finally, I would like to reiterate my appreciation to all of Universal’s hardworking associates. Your commitment to training, learning and servicing the customer truly makes a difference. I’m pleased with our overall Q3 performance driven by our diversified portfolio of services, which continue to provide value to our customers, shareholders and associates.I would now like to turn the call over to Jude for a detailed view of our financial performance. Jude?Thanks Tim. Good morning everyone. Yesterday, Universal Logistics Holdings reported consolidated net income of $23 million or $0.88 per share on total operating revenues of $421.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. This compares to net income of $48.5 million or $1.84 per share on total operating revenues of $505.7 million during the same period last year. For comparison purposes, please note the third quarter of 2022 was the peak of the trucking cycle for Universal and reflected the highest ever reported results in our history.Consolidated income from operations was $36.8 million for the quarter compared to $69.8 million 1 year earlier. EBITDA decreased $27.6 million to $56.7 million, which compares to $84.4 million during the same period last year. Our operating margin and EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2023 are 8.7% and 13.5% of total operating revenue. These metrics compare to 13.8% and 16.7%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022.Looking at our segment performance for the third quarter of 2023, in our Contract Logistics segment, which includes our value-add and dedicated transportation businesses, income from operations decreased $300,000 to $35.1 million on $208.1 million of total operating revenues. This compares to operating income of $35.4 million on $209.5 million of total operating revenue in the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins for the quarter were 16.9%, matching last year’s margin, which was also a record in our Contract Logistics segment.On to our Intermodal segment, operating revenues decreased $67.8 million to $86.6 million compared to $154.4 million in the same period last year. And income from operations decreased $32.5 million to an operating loss of $4.3 million. This compares to operating income of $28.1 million in the third quarter of 2022. Operating ratios for the quarter were 105% versus 81.8% last year. As mentioned in Tim’s comments, our Intermodal segment’s operating results were negatively impacted by operating losses in our West Coast operation. For the quarter, California drayage operations lost $6.5 million impacting segment margins by 750 basis points and consolidated results by $0.19 per share.In our Trucking segment, operating revenues for the quarter decreased $2.5 million to $97.1 million compared to $99.6 million in the same quarter last year, while income from operations increased $1.8 million to $6.6 million. This compares to operating income of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins for the quarter were 6.8% versus 4.8% last year, supported by the strong performance from our wind energy business.In our Company-Managed Brokerage segment, operating revenues for the quarter decreased $12.5 million to $28.1 million compared to $40.6 million in the same quarter last year. And income from operations decreased $2.1 million to an operating loss of $1.1 million. This compares to operating income of $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins for the quarter were negative 3.8% versus a positive 2.7% last year.On our balance sheet, we held cash and cash equivalents totaling $16.8 million and $10.5 million of marketable securities. Outstanding interest-bearing debt net of $4.8 million of debt issuance costs totaled $387.2 million at the end of the period. Excluding lease liabilities related to ASC 842, our net interest-bearing debt to reported trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.63x. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $112.3 million, including $80 million for the acquisition of a strategic terminal in California. For 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the $235 million range and interest expense to be between $20 million to $25 million.Based on the current operating environment, for the fourth quarter of 2023, we are expecting top line revenues between $350 million and $375 million and operating margins in the 7% to 9% range. If the UAW strike continues longer than anticipated or expands to additional operations we support, we will update our guidance during the quarter. Finally, Wednesday, our Board of Directors declared Universal’s $0.105 per share regular quarterly dividend. This quarter’s dividend is payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4, 2023 and is expected to be paid on January 2, 2024.With that, Nick, we are ready to take some questions.[Operator Instructions] First question will be from Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning team. This is Matt Milask on for Bruce. Just wanted to – I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you saw some volume attrition resulting from UAW late in the quarter. I just wanted to know if you could provide any more color as to what’s going on there and if you think the rate of disruption might change meaningfully going into next quarter. Thanks.Yes. Matt, this is Tim. Yes, we did see some disruption coming out of the third quarter as individual plants went down week-after-week. I think they made a difference tailing out of the quarter in the operating results, and we will carry some of that into the beginning of the fourth quarter. It is our hope because we are not in the negotiations that there would be a near-term resolution to it. And you saw one of those of the big three come out with this week, and we are hoping that the others follow suit. So, I think that was taken into consideration also as we looked at what we thought our fourth quarter performance was going to be.Okay. Fair enough. Secondly, could you provide just sort of your maybe general outlook for the industrial economy moving into next year?Yes. The general outlook from what we know and what we have heard from our customer base, if I start on the over the road or the truckload transportation group, we know that in steel and some of the industrial equipment that we traditionally move on, flatbed did take a dive in the third quarter. We expect that to remain kind of the picture or the roadmap at least in the fourth quarter heading into Q1. If I look beyond just the domestic transportation, from an international standpoint, we definitely saw a slowdown in some of the industrial type of products that we import. Well, we move that is imported into the country. So, I expect that kind of aligns with it from our customer base that the industrial space will continue to see a slower type environment. I can’t predict next year exactly, but I would think that Q4 and Q1 will experience some headwinds.Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. And lastly, would you be able provide sort of the new normalized earnings power bogey for the company at this point? Thanks.Hey. This is Jude. So historically, we have talked that in a normal operating environment, we should be around $1 a share a quarter. But obviously, we don’t have a normal operating environment, right, in the middle of a freight recession and of course, the headwinds that we are now experiencing with UAW. But you kind of saw last year, I mean we had peak earnings of over $6 a share. So, that would probably be the ultimate earnings power of the company at this point for our scale at the current size that we are. But I mean $1 a share, we think is kind of a baseline in a normal operating environment with upside from there.Great. Thanks a lot.Thank you.[Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer section. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Phillips for closing remarks.Thank you, Nick. The current landscape presents some challenges, but with disruptions will come opportunity. Universal will be positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. I appreciate everyone calling in and I look forward to talking to you again for the Q4 earnings call in February of 2024. Thank you and have a great day.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-27T13:47:06.000-04:00
NOV: Riding The Wave Of International Drilling Growth,"Within the intricate tapestry of the oilfield services and equipment sector, a distinct pattern is emerging. As I've highlighted in past articles ( and ), we're observing a dichotomy: on one side, a lull in the US drillingRecently, NOV  what I think were impressive results for the second quarter, demonstrating both earnings growth and enhanced margins. The company posted revenues totaling $2.09 billion, marking a 21% increase from the same quarter of the previous year and a 7% uptick from the preceding quarter. Each of its three business divisions - Wellbore Technologies (WT), Completion & Production Solutions (C&P), and Rig Technologies (RT) - played a significant role in the sequential and year-over-year growth.The company's adjusted EBITDA witnessed a significant leap of 63% year-over-year and 25.6% quarter-over-quarter, culminating in $245 million. This increase was fueled by comprehensive earnings growth across the three segments, notably on a year-over-year basis. WT and C&P showcased robust double-digit increase in earnings both sequentially and year-over-year. On the other hand, RT displayed a 73% annual and an approximately 3% quarter-on-quarter earnings growth.The adjusted EBITDA margin also underwent a positive shift, reaching 11.7% in Q2 2023, up from 8.7% in Q2 2022 and 9.9% in Q1 2023. This operational excellence translated into a net profit of $0.39 per share, a significant rise from the $0.18 reported the previous year and the $0.32 from the prior quarter.However, I think it's essential to highlight one area of concern: NOV's operating cash flow was reported at a negative $72 million. This setback was primarily propelled by a working capital adjustment to the tune of $300 million. This particular aspect of working capital has been an ongoing financial challenge for the company. Yet, when one excludes the impact of these working capital changes, NOV's operational cash flow stands at a positive $157 million. After accounting for capital expenditures, which amounted to $76 million, the company's adjusted free cash flow settles at $81 million, based on this analysis.In sum, NOV's pronounced growth in both revenue and profits, accompanied by margin expansion, stands in stark relief against its domestic business climate. This is in contrast to the business environment at home, especially in the onshore market, which remains challenging.The sector of oilfield services and equipment has been navigating through challenging waters, largely attributed to the reduced drilling momentum in North America. The most recent weekly rig count  from Baker Hughes () showed another dip in the US's active oil and gas rigs, bringing the count down to 659 for the week ending on August 4, a decrease from the 664 rigs observed the week prior. This pivotal indicator, often employed to assess the drilling activity, has observed declines 13 times over the recent 14-week span. Year-over-year analysis reveals that drillers have decommissioned 105 rigs, translating to a 14% decrease in the rig count.The decline in drilling activity is  to imprint on the crude oil and condensate production levels in the Lower 48 states where the production remained relatively stable in May compared to April. However, this might be a potential precursor to a production downturn, a shift that usually mirrors the drilling activity trajectory but with a delay of a few months.This lull in the US onshore market paints a contrasting picture when juxtaposed with the strength observed in the international and offshore markets. It's noteworthy that while the drilling rig count has fallen sharply on a YoY basis in the US, it has gone up in the international markets. Major players in the international domain, encompassing national giants like Saudi Aramco () and a slew of international oil corporations and independents, have added 128 new oil and gas rigs over the past year, as per data from Baker Hughes. Consequently, regions such as the Middle East and Asia are witnessing a surge in the demand for oilfield services and equipment.The offshore drilling landscape is undergoing a resurgence, with heightened activity spotted across markets like the North Sea, Brazil, and the Middle East. This revitalization is propelled by a confluence of factors: robust oil price trends, the urgency of energy security, and the growing significance of regionalization. This rise in drilling activity in the international and offshore markets has been  multiple times by Schlumberger (), a behemoth in the industry with a stronghold in these territories. This thriving offshore and international drilling activity is the driving force behind NOV's upward trajectory, compensating for the sluggishness observed domestically.NOV typically  of its revenues from international markets, which puts it in a great position to benefit from the increase in drilling activity outside of North America. To put things into perspective, in the initial quarter, a notable 60% of NOV's revenue was generated from international engagements. This is further bolstered by NOV's significant footprint in the offshore arena.In fact, the earnings growth reported by NOV in all of its segments was driven entirely by the strength in the international land and offshore markets, which offset the negative impact of the softness in the US. For instance, the company's WT segment experienced an upswing in demand, particularly from regions like the Middle East and Africa, and from international and national oil conglomerates venturing into deep-water drilling pursuits. Concurrently, while the C&P arm grappled with a dampened demand in North America, the rise in international and offshore demand ensured NOV's margin expansion and earnings growth.The international and national oil companies are ramping up drilling activities across regions such as the Middle East, Asia, West and North Africa, North Sea, Guyana, Brazil, and offshore Mexico. These oil and gas moguls have charted aggressive roadmaps for the upcoming years, a prospect that augurs well for NOV. Such a favorable demand climate has instilled confidence in NOV, hinting at potential price increases that could meaningfully enhance margins.Additionally, it's essential to spotlight NOV's ongoing cost-optimization strategy. This is anticipated to yield annual savings to the tune of $75 million in the next 12 months. Compounding this positive trajectory, NOV is set to transition from previously inked low-margin contracts-borne out of less favorable business climates-to ones promising higher margins. I believe all of this promises a substantive margin escalation in the forthcoming quarters.However, NOV's cash flow dynamics experienced turbulence, predominantly due to the pandemic's ripple effects that led to many foundries ceasing operations. This compelled the company to recalibrate its supply chain and maintain elevated inventory levels, which subsequently impacted its free cash flows. But the silver lining is evident: a transition towards stabilization. As noted in their recent conference call, NOV's management  to the normalization of supplies. While complete rectification of supply chain intricacies might still be on the horizon, the current trajectory suggests an optimistic shift. This alignment is already reflecting positively on NOV's sales growth and profit margins. Moving forward, this trend will continue and I expect the company to start delivering free cash flows from the near term, possibly from 2024.In my opinion, NOV's foothold in international and offshore markets poises it for continued revenue and earnings growth. Coupled with its ongoing cost cutting efforts, the outlook for margin enhancement remains positive. However, the shadow of supply chain disruptions continues to linger, albeit with expectations of progressive improvement. A fully optimized NOV could soon become a reality, and I expect this to have a positive impact on the company's shares which should move higher.NOV stock, however, isn't looking attractive from a valuation perspective. The company holds a valuation  of D+ on Seeking Alpha. The company's shares are trading 14x forward earnings estimates, which shows a 29% premium over the sector median. Due to its weak cash flows which might take some time to improve, its shares are priced 20.4x forward cash flows, a whopping 306% premium over the sector median. I suggest that investors to wait for a dip before buying this stock.Note that NOV's investment proposition isn't devoid of risk. Predominant concerns revolve around the deteriorating US market conditions. Should this downtrend persist or intensify, NOV could witness its robust growth narratives - in revenues, earnings, and margins - coming under pressure. This could not only impede its financial performance but also hurt its stock. Additionally, if cash flow issues persist beyond current projections, it might cast a shadow over its financial health.

Iron ore moves to month's best levels as China stimulus boosts sentiment,"Iron ore futures rose Monday following the most recent stimulus moves by China's government, outweighing downward pressure from production cuts among some steel mills due to shrinking margins.According to Reuters, the most-traded January iron ore () on China'sRio Tinto () , Vale ()  and BHP ()  pre-market; other potentially relevant stocks include Fortescue (), Glencore () () and Anglo American () ().China's central bank added liquidity support to the banking system by conducting medium-term lending facility operations worth 789B yuan, and iron ore inventories fell for the fifth consecutive week to 105.2 million tons as of October 13, the lowest since June 2020, according to data from the Steelhome consultancy.But the continued crisis in China's property sector, the world's largest steel consumer, likely will keep demand restrained despite further stimulus, ANZ bank said.",0,2023-10-16T07:17:33.000-04:00
Epiroc AB (publ) (EPOKY) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Epiroc AB (publ) () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2023 7:00 AM ETKarin Larsson - Head of IR and MediaHelena Hedblom - CEOHakan Folin - CFOJohn Kim - Deutsche BankKlas Bergelind - CitiMax Yates - Morgan StanleyBenjamin Heelan - Bank of AmericaGustaf Schwerin - HandelsbankenChristian Hinderaker - Goldman SachsAndreas Koski - BNP Paribas ExaneAnders Roslund - Pareto SecuritiesAnders Idborg - ABG Sundal CollierHello, and a warm welcome to the Epiroc Q3 Results Presentation. My name is Karin Larsson, Head of Investor and Media Relations here at Epiroc. As always, when we present the results, I have the pleasure to stand here with Helena Hedblom, our CEO, and Hakan Folin, our CFO. They will briefly present the results before we host a shorter Q&A session.Helena, please, the stage is yours.So thank you, Karin. So hello, and a warm welcome from my side as well.So, let me jump straight into the quarter. As anticipated, the demand in the third quarter was seasonally weaker than in the previous quarter. The demand and activity level remained high within mining and several large mining equipment, orders were won. Construction customers, on the other hand, remained hesitant and tentative.So within mining, it was a particularly strong demand for automation and connectivity solutions, both for acquired solutions as well as for our own solutions. So in total, our orders increased 17% year-on-year to SEK14.4 billion.In September, we announced our largest ever order, SEK700 million, to provide Kamoa Copper in Democratic Republic of the Congo with underground equipment. So after several years, with local presence and highly skilled and committed service technicians on site, the collaboration between Epiroc and Kamoa Copper has deepened into aAnd it's especially exciting to contribute to the success of the Kamoa-Kakula Copper Mining Complex, as it is projected to be among the world's lowest greenhouse gas emitting copper mines per unit of metal produced. Our revenues increased 17% to SEK15 billion, drivenAnd our operating margin, EBIT, increased sequentially versus last quarter, but decreased year-on-year. It was supported by currency, but acquisitions, under-absorption, investments in R&D and marketing as well as product mix impacted negatively. And Hakan will elaborate more on the margin later, but I can assure you that we are taking measures where needed, while continuing to invest to remain a technology leader also in the future.So with more advanced technology, automation, digitalization and electrification, it is more likely that we at Epiroc will also perform the service on the equipment, and this drives both revenues and profit. But the increasing number of service technicians in the field, comes with a great responsibility. We must continue to make sure all our employees always act with safety in mind.And several actions have been taken to reduce injuries, and we have a positive trend in the development of our safety indicators. But that said, I'm very sad to share that we have lost a service employee in a fatal accident in the quarter. Safety is our top priority, and it is crucial that all Epiroc employees come home safe and sound, after the working day.In my next slide, I would like to speak about that partnership is the new leadership. So this is something that I truly believe in. And the order I just mentioned from Kamoa Copper, is one good example. But there are more good examples, like our partnership with Newcrest, one of the world's largest gold mining companies. In 2021, we announced that we created a semiautonomous production level in their Cadia mine.And this project with mixed fleet equipment is developing well. And in this quarter, we now take our collaboration even further. So we will now take a holistic approach towards the entire mining processes at several of Newcrest mines, supported by Epiroc's leading portfolio of automation, digitalization, and electrification solutions. So in short, it means that we share a vision on how to make the whole mining process more efficient and we will together invest, to finding the best solutions to do so.Another collaboration we are engaged in is with Boliden and Algoryx and Orebro University, and the project includes the creation of a digital twin of a mine, a simulated testing environment for artificial machine learning, which greatly reduces the need for physical testing.And speaking of reducing the need for physical interaction, do remember our Automatic Bit Changer, which enables hand-free bit changes and enhances productivity and safety, by eliminating human interaction with a drill string. So following the very positive customer feedback, we have now extended this solution to include a wider fleet of Pit Vipers. So please let me share a short video on the Automatic Bit Changer.[Video Presentation]So as a short refresher, I would like to remind you of our strategy. So we focus on attractive niches and outperformance, and the way forward is defined by innovation, aftermarket, and operational excellence, all of which rely on a foundation of a strong company culture and sustainability mindset. So innovation is to a large extent already covered today when I spoke about us being a productivity and sustainability partner to our customers.And now I would like to cover the aftermarket, another very important part of our business. So it represents roughly 70% of our revenues in the quarter and includes service and tools and attachments. And within service, we see continued high activity, especially in mining. With an aging fleet around eight and a half years on average, we also see a strong demand for parts and for rebuilds.For tools and attachment, the demand picture is more mixed. The largest portion of the revenues in tools and attachment, is rock drilling tools used both in mining and construction applications. And the demand there is good. The smaller, but more profitable revenue stream, is the hydraulic attachment, and here we see good demand for infrastructure projects, while the construction demand within housing and aggregates is lower.Q1 and Q2 that are normally strong quarters for construction work, were weaker this year, and we see that the demand is still at low levels, and we anticipate that the construction demand will remain weak.And this brings me to the next topic within our strategy, operational excellence. So, we are adjusting operations to remain agile and resilient, and we have taken actions and we will take more actions to improve our performance. So within production, we are adjusting to reduce under-absorption.We're also improving our manufacturing footprint, for example, moving production of low-profile machines from Orebro, Sweden to Johannesburg in South Africa. On the admin side, we continue with the rollout of our regional centers of excellence for finance and HR to improve processes, efficiency, and quality.So coming then over to sustainability, as I said, always safety first. And as I said in the beginning of the presentation today, I'm very sad to report a service employee fatality in Kazakhstan in the quarter, and we are working with the customers and local authorities to investigate the circumstances around the accident. On the safety metrics, we do, however, see improvements and we have taken several actions, to reduce injuries even further.On headcounts, we are still growing. We are now a little bit more than 18,000 employees in our Epiroc family and we have continued, to increase the proportion of women employees and women managers. We also have 1,800 additional employees that are also contributing to our progress.On the emissions, we have managed to lower the CO2e emission from our operations for comparable units during the last 12 months with 26%, thanks to several initiatives including installations of solar panels and a higher share of renewable electricity. And the CO2e emissions from transport has however increased somewhat, which is explained by higher volumes delivered.But as you all know, the emissions from us is mainly related to Scope 3, the use of products. So let me share an example of what our solutions can bring. In February this year, we finalized the acquisition of CR, and that has widened our portfolio to also include GET system. And GET is short for ground engagement tools. So with the right Cast Lip and GET system, customers can enjoy 10% more productivity while saving both energy and carbon emissions. So one bucket like you see in this example can reduce emissions by over 350 tons.So with this, Hakan, over to you to cover the financials.Okay. Thank you very much, Helena.So I will start with the key financials, and sequentially, our orders were down, which was anticipated, as Q3 is normally a seasonally weaker quarter. But year-on-year, our orders received increased by 70% to SEK14.4 billion, supported by acquisitions, they contributed with 7%, and also by currency with 1%. The organic increase was 9%, but if we add back the removal of the Russian order book in Q3 2022, which was SEK1 billion, we had a flat organic development.Customer activity remained high in mining. Several large equipment orders were won. Revenues also increased by 17% to SEK15 billion, and here we had an organic growth of 7%. Acquisitions contributed strongly by 9%.Then a few words on our cash flow before discussing the margin on the next page. Our operating cash flow increased to SEK1.9 billion, and if we compare to the same period in previous year, it was supported by higher operating profit, however, negatively impacted from net financial items and also higher taxes paid.Our operating profit EBIT increased by 12% to SEK3.3 billion, so it's up from SEK2.9 billion last year, and I would argue that this is a meaningful increase. Items affecting comparability in this quarter were negative SEK12 million, consisting mainly of the change in provision for our share-based long-term incentive program. The comparable period in previous year included a provision of SEK150 million related to Russia.Looking at the adjusted operating margin, excluding then items affecting comparability, it came in at 21.8%, down from 23.9% last year, supported by currency, while acquisition, investment in R&D and marketing impacted negatively, and also product mix and underabsorption in Tools & Attachment had an impact.And looking at acquisitions more specifically, the dilution from them was 1.0 percentage point. As Helena said, we have taken and we will continue to take measures where needed within the organization to improve our profitability.If we then go into the segments and we start with Equipment & Service. Orders received increased by 16% to SEK11.3 billion, with an organic increase of 9%. And if we adjust for Russia again, orders were down 1% organically. For equipment specifically, the orders received amounted to SEK4.5 billion, which corresponds to an organic increase of 14%, but if we adjust for Russia, in equipment, orders were down 5% organically.Having said that, we still feel that investment sentiment among our customers continued to be strong in the quarter, and we won several large orders. In total, we won large orders of SEK1.1 billion, including the two announced orders from Kamoa in DRC and also Byrnecut in Australia. Last year in Q3, we had around SEK1 billion in large orders. So we are more or less on the same level this year as we were last year.For our service business, orders received increased by 12% to SEK6.8 billion with a strong contribution from acquisitions. The organic growth was 5%, reflecting then a continued high activity level as well as a continued good demand for the large rebuilds that we do. And for service, if we adjust for Russia, service orders were up 3% organically. So our service business continues to perform strongly with a steady and solid organic growth.Operating profit for Equipment & Service was up 16% to SEK2.9 billion, and here, higher revenues, currency, and acquisition contributed to the development. The operating margin was 24.5%, almost flat compared to last year, but then again last year, the margin was impacted by provisions related to Russia and for this segment, it was SEK138 million.If we look at the adjusted operating margin, it was 24.4%, down from last year 25.9%, supported by currency. However, acquisitions impacted margin negatively, so did also the higher investment we're doing in R&D and sales activities. And within this segment, the dilution from acquisitions was 1.1 percentage point. And as you can see, the adjusted margin is slightly lower than the reported one. That is due to release from an M&A provision in previous year of SEK7 million.If we then move on to Tools & Attachment, here orders increased 17% to SEK2.9 billion, up 2% organically, and acquisitions, and this is mainly CR, which Helena presented previously contributed with 15% while currency was flat. And if we adjust for Russia, orders here were down 1% organically.As we said before, the demand from the mining customer was good, but the demand from construction customers continued to be weak, and this impacts mainly the hydraulic attachment business negatively. Important markets such as Europe and U.S., they have a weaker housing and aggregates market. On the other hand, we see that infrastructure is holding up rather well.On the revenue side, they increased by 18% to SEK3.2 billion, down 2% organically. Acquisition contributed with 19% and currency added another 1%.For Tools & Attachment, the operating profit was down 6% to SEK481 million. The adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, down from 19.4%, negatively impacted by lower revenues and underabsorption, mainly in the hydraulic attachment business, and this in turn also impact the product mix negatively for this segment.Currency contributed positively to the margin, while structure had a small negative impact on the margin. However, if you look in absolute terms, structure, which include acquisitions then, had a large positive impact. And in this segment particularly, we have already taken some actions and we will continue to focus on working smarter and more efficient going forward.Then moving on to the next slide, which is on costs, net financials and tax. As said, we invest in our customer activities we invest in R&D in order to generate business and develop state-of-the-art solutions for our customers. Having said that, cost control is for us equally important. And here I believe that we can be more efficient on the costs side onwards, while we at the same time, continue to invest in our business.Net financial items were SEK331 million, negatively affected by the exchange rate difference and also the net interest was up. It was SEK146 million, which is significantly higher than last year when it was only SEK23 million, which is explained by our higher debt and also by the overall higher interest rates. On average, our rate has increased from 2.5% and we are now north of 4%, and that makes a rather big difference. Income tax expense was SEK685 million and the effective tax rate increased to 23.4% from 22% last year. However, this is still within the guided range we have of 22% to 24%.Moving on to operating cash flow, which has improved both sequentially, but also year-on-year. On the positive side, we have a higher profit and we also have less working capital buildup than last year, but we have a negative impact from higher financial items, taxes paid, and also investment. The cash conversion rate, which is calculated here on a rolling 12-month basis, was 55%, which is an improvement compared to the last quarter. I think we can do better here and we do expect better cash flow and better cash conversion onwards.And let's elaborate a bit on the working capital side. Compared to last year, the net working capital have increased 29%, and is now at SEK23 billion. If we exclude the effect of acquisitions and currency, it has increased by 25%. And the increase, I would say, is mainly explained by a long period of strong growth both in equipment and in service with corresponding higher level of inventories and receivable. And actually, a fairly meaningful portion of our inventory is equipment, either in transit or at our workshop, at our customer centers, on the way to be delivered to our customers. And I mentioned the so-called RORO capacity, roll-on/roll-off, within shipping. This is still an issue for us, and it limits our ability to get our equipment delivered to our customers.Our implementation of the regional distribution centers is ongoing. This ties up a meaningful portion of our spare part. It continues, but we are seeing an improvement in our ways of working here. And you can rest assured that inventory management is a very prioritized topic for us. When we look at the total average net working capital in relation to revenues and also here on a rolling 12-month basis, it was up to 34.8%.So finally from me, before I hand back to you, Helena, a few words on our working capital efficiency. We have a net debt position of SEK7.6 billion. Last year at this point, we were actually cash positive. So it's quite a big difference, and the main explanation is the acquisitions that we have made.If we look on the return on capital employed, we have been rather stable around 28%, if you compare to last year. But if you compare to two years ago, we were at 25%, so quite a strong improvement since then.Okay. Over to you, Helena.Thank you.So before speaking about the future then, I will briefly summarize this quarter. So safety is on the top of the agenda always, and we will continue to educate and work on improving safety, both for us and for our customers. We had continued high demand in mining in the quarter, and we landed several large orders, which is the result of good long-term collaboration with customers. I truly believe that partnership is the new leadership. Construction was weak in the quarter, while infrastructure had a stable development.We delivered strong revenues, up 17% year-on-year, including a good performance from our acquisitions. And onwards, we will continue to focus on operational excellence while protecting and gaining customer share. The operating cash flow improved both year-on-year and sequentially.And finally then, a few words on the near term. So we expect that the underlying mining demand, both for equipment and aftermarket, will remain at a high level, and that the demand from construction customers is expected to be soft. And I would like to emphasize that this statement is referring to underlying demand trends and not absolute order levels for us at Epiroc.So thank you, and over to you, Karin.Thank you, Helena. Thank you, Hakan.So before starting the Q&A, I would just like to highlight the important dates for the next year, and especially, I would like all of you to mark your calendars for September 24 as we will host our CMD in Las Vegas in conjunction with the MINExpo, and that's the largest mine fair in the world.So operator, you may now open the line for questions. Thank you.[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from John Kim from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Hi. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for the opportunity. Two questions, if I may. If we think about the near term, call it the next two to three years, how should we think about production levels and visibility, given issues in key end markets like Chinese construction and perhaps electric vehicles? A more pointed question for the shorter term, can you speak about what you're seeing in underlying demand dynamics within hydraulic attachments? Thank you.I think if we start with the second one there, so on hydraulic attachment, we see solid demand for the portion of the products that goes into mining as well as infrastructure projects, while say, subsegments that is more related to housing and aggregates, that's where we see lower demand. And if I look on it from a regional perspective, it's the same trend in U.S., the same trend in Europe, as well as India, which are our main markets. I think on the - did I understand you correctly that when you asked about the, let's say, the activity levels, it was more related to construction also in China for the coming years? Was that the question?And perhaps a little bit different. I mean, bulk of your business is driven by mining and copper is a key exposure. You've had good orders recently. But when you look at kind of key end markets for copper consumption, you could argue construction and perhaps China is a key use, and that looks to be trending negative. I'm just wondering if you're seeing that feed through - part of the value chain?Yes. I would say on copper, yes, you know, I see what you are looking at there, but I think at the same time on copper, there are this supply demand gap that is also - will be there in the coming years, leading to that expansion projects will have to happen; also greenfield will have to happen to safeguard production output in the coming years.So, I think that should also be taken into consideration, when looking at the overall demand as well as lower grades. I think copper, is also the commodity where we see that the grades are going down.That's fair. Does that give you material advantage on pricing or utilization levels, the declining copper grade?Yes. And more complex, you need to go deeper. It's more complex ore bodies and that is good for us, because that - it's more advanced equipment needed, more safety aspects that you need to take into consideration, with depth et cetera. So, I think there are the overall - the underlying trends, are making it more difficult to bring up the same amount of metals in the coming years. And here, of course, also our technology solutions, helps our customers, to do the business at more difficult levels and more difficult environment.Okay. Helpful. Thank you.The next question comes from Klas Bergelind from Citi. Please go ahead.Thank you. Hi, Karin and Hakan. Klas at Citi. So, my first one is on the underlying orders, actually SEK1.1 billion in large orders. The decline quarter-on-quarter ex-currency and M&A appears bigger than normal seasonality. And you say that the mining outlook is still solid, Helena, and you have indeed received obviously big orders, but just on the underlying side, are these sort of near-term push-outs of order decisions, because of higher funding costs, or are we having sort of construction exposure also within E&S, not only within T&A, that is sort of driving down orders a bit? If you could comment there, that would be very useful?Yes, I would say that that is the case. You are spot on. So we - of course, we also have equipment for construction applications and we see tunneling going strong. But at the same time, related more - the more, smaller machines going towards housing and demolition and quarries. There we see a softer demand, not only on the attachment side, but also on equipment. But when I look at the underlying activity levels, when I look at the age of the fleet, when I look on the pipeline, it's still holding up well in mining.Good to hear. And when it comes to then, one for you, Hakan, the drop-through in Equipment & Service, the organic drop-through is now negative on high single-digit sales, which is a bit unusual. You talk about R&D, SG&A, under-absorption, but I'm trying to understand, what kind of drop-through we should model going forward, here next couple of quarters. You're talking about potentially taking out cost here, to improve the leverage. Is this a short-term fix, or do you think that this is sort of the level, we should model here in the near term? Thank you.No, I mean, we have, since I started at least, almost every quarter, showed a fairly good solid flow-through, and now this quarter was an exception. And this is an area where we think, that we can definitely do better. So no, we don't want you to model in that, we're going to have negative flow-through in the years going forward. That's something we are - we are not happy with that performance and we aim to do it better going forward.Then we're not going to guide you on a specific level of exactly, what the flow-through will be. That was a difficult word to say, but we definitely think that we can do better than we did this quarter.And just to - from my side as well, we are not happy with our efficiency in the quarter, and we have already taken measures, to improve and we will continue to do so.And then Okay, thank you. My final one for you, Helena, on the service side, 3% growth in orders ex the Russia comp. I guess you still have pricing in that. So volumes are perhaps down a bit. We've seen miners struggling with production with some pent-up production demand having like - couple of quarters. But I'm curious here on the rebuilds, in the same way as we see the equipment push-outs, maybe not for you, but across the whole suppliers. Do you think there is a risk here that this can happen as well on the rebuilds or are you still seeing rebuilds being relatively solid?I would say rebuilds are solid. So I would say - I think I said the same last quarter, but with a big portion also - or big portion, but a bigger portion of our service revenues coming from these service products and rebuilds, and it can be variation between the quarters. But when I look at how much we're landing when it comes to rebuilds, it's a very solid level.And I don't expect that to be - to come down even if, there would be push-outs in decision for equipment moving forward. I don't expect rebuilds to - that will not follow the same logic, because that's an operational decision. So very often, we have seen that you do lodge your rebuilds actually, when the activity levels are lower in mining, because that's also when you can do it in an efficient way.Thank you.The next question comes from Max Yates from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Hi, good afternoon. Could I just start on the Tools & Attachments margin and the changes that you're making? I think if I look back at sort of Q1, when you were last doing a 23% margin at group level, you were doing around 17% in the Tools & Attachments business. I guess my question is, how quickly would you expect, assuming we're not getting a kind of big top line recovery anytime soon in Tools & Attachments. How quickly, do you think the changes that you're making, will get margins kind of back up to what, I guess, we would consider, or maybe you would consider, a more normalized level? Is that something that happens in a quarter, or is that something that happens sort of going into 2024?I wouldn't say in a quarter, but in a couple of quarters. Then, of course, this is - it is a mix effect. So of course, to adjust operations is one thing, but there's also a product mix effect here. We have higher margins on our attachment business, than on the traditional consumables business. So, there will still be a mix effect, but I think the inefficiency that we have in the -- in our, let's say, operations in this quarter, due to the lower volumes, that of course, we're addressing and addressing quickly.Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. Could you help us a little bit with the actual sort of revenue split of your Tools & Attachments business? And I guess you talked about kind of the rock drilling tools was good, hydraulic attachments was a little bit weaker in construction. And the other business I was curious about, given Sandvik's comments, they talked about their business sort of ground support, so sort of steel bars holding up mines, was seeing some quite negative price impacts. How big would that business be for you? As I kind of had a look, and it does look like you have some exposure here. And are you also seeing sort of similar pricing trends where Sandvik talks about their pricing being down about 10% in that business?So if we start with the first question, we have not shared, we'll say, the exact split, but if I look on the total, the consumables business is the largest portion of TLD and the attachment business is the smaller one. So - but we have not shared, let's say, the split between them. When it comes to rock reinforcements that is a small piece.And I don't see the same things happening on the pricing side. I think for - we are very focused on deep mines, with seismic activities where you have special solutions and where you can sell value, when it comes to rock reinforcement. So that's the, let's say, the offering we have towards rock reinforcement and that subsegment.And if I may add, Helena, we also now have the fourth type of business within Tools & Attachment of the acquisition of CR, so the ground engagement tools as well.And maybe just a really quick housekeeping question. I mean, just when you show that admin marketing and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales, and I look at it sort of year-over-year, it was 16% of sales in Q3 '22. It was 16.1% in Q2 '23, and it's 16.1% this year, this quarter. I guess that's not really much of a change. So should we sort of infer from that the actual size of the extra kind of investments on margin was maybe 10 basis points and actually it was the other issues that were bigger? Or is there some investments that maybe aren't in this line? Could you help us size what the kind of impact was from that extra investment?But I would say rather that with the growth we have, we expect to have efficiency in admin. That's part of our operational excellence initiative. We always strive for more efficiency on admin. So then, of course, we need that also to be able to continue to invest in product development and our presence. So for me, it's more that, okay, we - with the increase in revenue, of course, we expect admin efficiency, and we have not seen that to the level that we expected.Okay. Thank you very much.The next question comes from Ben Heelan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.Yes, thank you. It's Ben from BofA. I wanted to come back on the order points because you talked about hesitation, and the orders do look as though they're slowing on the OE side, and we'd heard some comments from some of the big miners about the current interest rate environment. So to your answer of the question a few questions ago, are you saying that on the mining side, you're just not really seeing any impact at all from the higher rate environment on investments in the sector and it's all about construction, or are you seeing that and it's just been benefited by some of these large orders? I'm a little bit confused about the commentary on the mining side of things. And then secondly, if I can, around pricing in general, are there any big changes that you're seeing from a pricing perspective across the business? Thank you.So we don't see hesitations among our mining customers. And I think what we landed several large orders, as Hakan said, in the quarter as well above a billion, which is - that's a big chunk of large orders. And when I look at the pipeline as well, and I think this is - but also, we need to remember that there's also constantly a need for replacement, and the fleet every year now has grown older. So of course, you come closer also to that replacement need. So I don't see that hesitation from the mining customers, but we see it on construction. So that's why we comment like this.On pricing, I have not - we don't see any difference. We work with pricing always, and it's always tied to our innovation and the value that we can create. So I wouldn't say that we see any - we don't behave in a different way than we normally do.Where we have seen a hesitation, but that we mentioned already, I think already in Q1, but definitely in Q2, is on the exploration side, and then especially more for the junior exploration companies there, we saw - when interest rates started to go up, we started to see more hesitation.Okay, great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on that. You said that Q3 was seasonally one of your smaller quarters. Should we assume there then that Q4 sequentially should see an improvement from an orders perspective? Is that how we should be thinking about the end of the year?I think as always, it's - it all depends on large orders, as always, which is always lumpy. So it's very difficult to predict when the large orders will come into the - into our books. So I would - when we comment, we comment on, we'll say, the underlying activity levels. We cannot predict the large orders.Okay. Very clear. Thank you.The next question comes from Gustaf Schwerin from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.Yes, hello. Thank you. Gustaf, Handelsbanken. I have a follow-up question on the leverage in Equipment & Service. So you have a similar share of service as a year ago. You're mentioning the higher SG&A, R&D. Then I look at, for example, Q1 this year where you have a quite similar mix as in Q3, quite similar organic growth, even though a bit higher on the service side, at the same time, you have a larger increase in the cost year-over-year, but Equipment & Service is posting 35% leverage in like quarter, so I mean, I struggle a bit to understand why we are at such a low level now. Is it only the higher cost base year-over-year and lower growth versus Q1? Or is there actually some kind of negative mix effect within service or anything else? Thank you.No, I wouldn't really say there's a negative mix impact. I think coming back to what we talked a little bit about before, is that we think that there are things also in Equipment & Service that we can do better than we did in this quarter, so not a really big mix impact. If you compare though to Q3 last year, a large portion of the change in the adjusted operating profit is coming from the dilution of acquisitions where we have made a few acquisitions within this segment and also they are growing quite nicely, as we showed, with 9% contribution to the revenue. But most of them, I would argue then, with a smaller, lower margin and thereby diluting the overall profit, but no real mix impact within the service part.All right. Thank you. And then I mean, just secondly, on the equipment deliveries, I mean, they look a bit low. Is this only outbound logistics? Because I got the impression before that we will not have much of a seasonal effect on deliveries for Q3. So it's outbound capacity?It's outbound, the RORO capacity, but on top of that, we also have, we'll say, bottlenecks right now in our local modification in our service centers doing the local modifications. And one example is Australia, for example. So we do the loss modification from safety aspect in - according to local legislation, and there we have bottlenecks that we are addressing right now. But that has put - we'll say, that has caused a problem when it comes to actually bringing because we are not happy with the output on equipment in the quarter. And if you - output from factories, yes, but not the output in the loss stage there. So that we are addressing as we speak as well.Just follow-up on that, because has that worsened quarter-on-quarter? Because I assume RORO capacity is probably a bit better in Q3 versus Q2.So this is more related to that these local modifications are competing with the same resources that we do rebuilds for - in the service. So it's the same service workshops. So it's - we have it in our own hands, and of course, it's more assemblers that is needed. So this is pure capacity within our own organization, not really related to the challenges we have had previously on - of course, there's still challenge with the RORO capacity on the outbound.Let's say, a big portion of why we have not really managed the output on the equipment in the quarter is that we have a bottleneck internally in our workshops out in the different customer centers, and specifically I would say in Australia.Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.The next question comes from Christian Hinderaker from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Yes. Good afternoon, Helena, Hakan and Karin. I just wanted to ask firstly on the margin headwinds, but maybe ask a little differently. You've cited marketing spend as one of the headwinds. I think that's been a little more than SEK1 billion in the past two quarters, up around 28% year-on-year on sales growth of a similar number at around 30% this quarter. I'd assume that would have been from the return of travel spend and costs like that coming back after COVID, but then if you look back to pre-COVID, the average was more in the mid-600 million levels in krona terms. I guess not dissimilar actually as a percent of sales though, looks a little bit shy of 7%. So just interested in what is driving that sequential and year-on-year pickup in marketing expense. How should we think about modeling that relative to sales? Should there be some efficiency as you expand the top line? I'll start there.Yes. So I would say that it's mainly initiatives to improve, and of course, to - it's both presence, it's to capture the future growth, but I think when - for this quarter now, we are not in line with from an efficiency standpoint. So there is clearly things we can do to improve efficiency in marketing as well, and that we have already initiated that work.So it's - I would say it's the traditional marketing and feet on the street, but also some larger projects that we have ongoing to understand and develop, let's say, how to capture the future opportunities as well in certain parts of the world.Thanks, Helena. Can I come back on inventories then? And specifically on the consumables side, I just wonder how we should think about your distribution model here. We know that you're moving to regional hubs. Can I ask what proportion of your customers are leaning on your balance sheet to hold their spare parts and requiring sort of 24/7 deliveries relative to the proportion that might opt for vendor managed inventory? And then what is your outlook for channel inventories in terms of consumables in mining? Could there be destocking? We've heard a mixed picture in that sense from the supplier peers this week. So I'd be interested in your thoughts.So the setup we have is that we have created these regional distribution centers in the different parts of region - in the different parts of the world with then - and we have structured that network so that we can deliver both parts and consumables within 24 hours to the customers in that region.On top of that, of course, when we have larger service contracts, we have consignment stock on the sites. So that's very much the model, and that's how we are operating both within parts and service and consumables.When it comes to destocking, we see destocking happening within the infrastructure side. So I think a part of the lower demand there, it's lower activity, but it's partly also destocking. We don't see destocking in the mining space. That's not really the - let's say, we have not seen anything like that within mining, but within construction and - because there also we use indirect channels and with indirect channels, that challenge can be there over time.Thank you. And thirdly, maybe on the CR acquisition, you made that in the fourth quarter last year and it was a focus of the case study, but also a driver of some of the acquisition dilution to the margin. Just wonder how that integration is progressing. What are your broader strategic ambitions here as well in terms of growing out the ground engaging tools product family? Is that organic only or inclusive of M&A? And how should we think about the vertical integration of this business? Because if I'm not mistaken, I think you have your own foundry that you've acquired now, whereas the majority of the group is not vertically integrated to the same extent. Thank you.Yes. So we are very happy with the progress on the integration as well as on the synergies. So I think this was very good fit with Epiroc. When we look at the CR business or ground engagement tool business, it's very much the same as Tools & Attachments. It's a productivity offering, long contracts in the same way you sell it on TCO, and you create contracts, three-year, up to five-year contracts with our customers, which are very similar to the consumables business.So of course, our ambition now is to grow this organically, I would say, mainly. And on top of that also, there is a nice suite of digital products that came with the CR acquisition that also now we can incorporate in the overall digital solution offering that we have at Epiroc. So very pleased with that acquisition.When it comes to integration or vertical integration, yes, CR had one foundry, but that is a small portion of the actual total flow of these type of raw material into their business. Majority of the flow comes from external parts - parties, and that's - I think it's a very good model. An own foundry is crucial to be able to develop new steel grades and to make sure that you have the right quality, but also that you can lead from an innovation standpoint.But we don't have any, let's say, further ambition when it comes to vertical integration. We believe in this asset-light model, and I think the setup with CR, it's a good fit from an asset-light perspective with one foundry and not more than that.Thank you, Helena.The next question comes from Andreas Koski from BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.Thank you very much and good afternoon. Three quick questions. Firstly on your outlook, you are saying that you expect construction demand to be soft, but does that mean that you expect it to weaken further from the third quarter, or did you consider the underlying demand in Q3, to be soft and we are going to see the same kind of, underlying demand in the fourth quarter?It's correct. So when we say soft, we already see it as soft, so not the same level as we have seen in Q3.Okay. And then two questions just on the margin; firstly, on the FX impact. At current currency rates, do you see the same year-over-year margin support from FX in Q4, or was the margin support in Q3 sort of a one-off effect?If I can answer that, in terms of FX, as you know, it depends both on the translation part, but also on the transaction part while - where the transaction part can be a bit more lumpy in terms of its revaluation of especially AP and AR on the actually balance day. And in Q2, we had a quite negative margin impact.Now, in Q3, we had a positive impact. If you look - if you take year-to-date, it's actually - it's a rather small impact. Looking into - and now in this quarter, it was more on the transaction side, rather than on the translation side. And again, the transaction side is more difficult, to estimate what it's going to be on the actual balance day.But in terms of the translation part, as I mentioned, I believe when I started presenting, since the corona has been fairly weak for a long time now, if there are no major changes, the translation part, we would expect to be fairly limited in Q4. Then the transaction part that might vary more.Okay. And then on the 250 basis points organic margin dilution, how much would you say come from mix and under-absorption, and how much come from R&D and marketing? The reason for asking is, because I guess, it's easier to adjust R&D and marketing, than mix and under-absorption?I think you can look at the two segments here and - because if you look on group level, yes, we have a -- we have lower margin, and we have this negative organic. The main portion of that comes from the Tools & Attachment segments where, as we mentioned before, there we both have the product mix and also, we have the product mix, given the lower sales of hydraulic attachment.And also the under-absorption, given that we have produced less. And I would add also its under-absorption not only, because the sales volumes are lower, but it's also an effect that we are trying to reduce the inventory. So, we have also adjusted production from that point of view. So the majority of that, you can actually see in that segment. I think that hopefully explains.Okay. Thank you very much.The next question comes from Vlad Sergievskiy from Barclays. Please go ahead. Vlad Sergievskiy, Barclays, your line is now unmuted. Please go ahead.The next question comes from Anders Roslund from Pareto Securities. Please go ahead.Yes, hello. I had just one question regarding the bottlenecks you mentioned here in production. It seems that you hardly grew at all volume wise in the equipment area, given a 5% increase. And if you take away some price, it seems that there must be some bottlenecks, and that means also that you have higher inventory levels. How quick could you sort of address those issues? Could we see a better outflow in the fourth quarter and a better cash flow? Or is it a gradual process?Yes. So it's - the bottleneck is not really in the production line - lines that we have. The bottlenecks are out in the customer centers in the workshops, where we do the final modifications, which means then that the machines are already in Australia or in Chile, which, of course, so you don't have the lead time. And that, of course, helps when we sort of manage to open up these bottlenecks, revenue will happen quicker. So it's not in the factories any longer.The challenge is out in the customer centers in certain markets. But I expect improvements in the coming two quarters, I would say. I cannot promise that we manage, to do everything in one quarter, but over the coming two quarters, I think this one will be sorted out. So, I would say it's a timing issue, but you're correctly, this - correct, this is also, of course, leading to that we're tying more inventory than we want.Okay. Thank you.The next question comes from Anders Idborg from ABG Sundal Collier. Please go ahead.Yes. Good afternoon. Just love to hear your thoughts, I mean, it seems to be the same way for all the mining equipment companies now; orders for equipment are okay in Q3, but not at all at the same level as in Q1 and Q2. I mean, with the hindsight that we have now, do you think there - given that lead times are coming down. Do you think there was a bit of over-ordering still inflating the first half orders, to something that was just not sustainable? Or do you think that sort of the step down now, is more sort of junior miners et cetera are having issues with funding cost et cetera, or a combination of the two? I mean, what would be your thoughts on that?I don't really - on the equipment side, we seldom see customers do speculation orders. I wouldn't say that that is - maybe towards construction, that could happen, because there the contractors don't - they don't know if they will win or if they will lose something. And there they can of course gamble with an order. Within mining, I wouldn't say that - we very seldom see speculation orders like that. We know our customers very well, and it's either replacements or it is expansion.And again, when we look at the orders received, also in Q3, roughly half of the orders for equipment relates to replacement orders and roughly half relates to expansion orders, and mainly then brownfield expansions. So, I wouldn't say that there is, I would say, an impact of - that we saw pre-ordering earlier. I think it's more timing issues and that will always be the case, when it comes to equipment, when they press the button to actually do the investment.Right. So maybe the equipment orders that we saw in the first half, I mean, those could very well be repeated once the market normalizes et cetera.Yes.Okay. Just secondly, I'm not sure if you mentioned it. Just an update on sort of the uptake of electric, uptake of battery-as-a-service, all of that. What kind of proportion you have now of order intake as electrified, that'd be useful? Thank you.So, we have not yet shared the, let's say, the amount, not per quarter at least. We shared it in - when we had the Capital Markets Day, but I would say that it's steadily improving. At the same time, it's fair to say that the large orders, the customers that are - that want to go fully electric [technical difficulty] won't be there another quarter. I think what is maybe more interesting is this, customers doing repeat orders, putting more orders in for one, two, three machines, et cetera.Because that proves that they have tested it and they are convinced. It's lower numbers in total. We don't see these fantastic orders and we had - none of the large orders in the quarter were BEVs, but I'm more focused on these repetitive and smaller ones. Because I think that will be how you transform the industry, not just trusting these large orders and greenfield operations to go green.That's fair. Thank you for your time.So already due to end this call. Thank you, Hakan, Helena. I know we have a few analysts still on the line. We have your names, and we will reach out to you after this call to make sure you get your questions answered. But for now, we say thank you very much, everyone, for taking the time today. And as always, we wish all of you successful investments. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you very much.",0,2023-10-27T12:19:04.000-04:00
Chesapeake Energy: Now A Pure Play Natural Gas Producer,"Chesapeake Energy () has sold off all its Eagle Ford assets, so it will be a natural gas (only) producer focused on the Marcellus and Haynesville going forward. Chesapeake will still report a bit of residual production of oil and NGLsChesapeake's Eagle Ford divestiture proceeds were largely in line with my expectations, although it should be noted that some of the proceeds will be received in installments and purchase price adjustments are reducing the actual amounts Chesapeake has been receiving upon deal close.I believe that Chesapeake is roughly fairly valued for a long-term $3.75 NYMEX gas scenario currently.Chesapeake Energy has now sold off all its Eagle Ford assets in three separate transactions for a total of $3.525I had initially valued Chesapeake's Eagle Ford assets at approximately $3 billion (in October 2022), but then increased the estimated value to  based on the metrics from the .The combined value of Chesapeake's Eagle Ford divestitures is thus in line with my expectations, although there are a couple of things to note about the transactions.The transactions included combined payments at closing of $3.025 billion, subject to closing adjustments. Another $500 million is to be paid in installments, with $166.25 million paid in the first year after closing (the closing dates vary by transaction), $116.25 million paid in years two and three and $101.25 million paid four years after closing. As well, the SilverBow transaction included up to $50 million in contingent payments depending on WTI prices during the year after the transaction closes.The various transactions also have effective dates that were well before the deal closing dates. The WildFire Energy deal closed on March 20, 2023, and had an effective date of October 1, 2022. The INEOS Energy deal closed on April 28, 2023, and also had an effective date of October 1, 2022. The SilverBow deal is expected to close by the end of 2023 and had an effective date of February 1, 2023.The large amount of time between the effective date and closing date has resulted in significant purchase price adjustments upon the closing of the deals.Chesapeake reported receiving $1.963 billion in proceeds from property divestitures in the first half of 2023, while it was scheduled to receive $2.375 billion in proceeds (subject to purchase price adjustments) in the first half of 2023 from its WildFire and INEOS deals.Chesapeake expects to average approximately 3,310 MMCF per day in natural gas production during the second half of 2023. Around 3,240 MMCF per day of this natural gas production comes from its Marcellus and Haynesville assets, while the remaining 2% of its natural gas production comes from the Eagle Ford assets which it recently sold to SilverBow.The SilverBow Eagle Ford assets may also average around 8,000 barrels per day in oil production and 9,500 barrels per day in production of NGLs during the second half of the year.This report assumes that the SilverBow deal closes at the end of 2023 for ease of calculation.The current natural gas strip for 2H 2023 is approximately $2.80. This leads to a projection that Chesapeake can generate $1.855 billion in revenues after hedges in the second half of the year.Chesapeake's 2H 2023 hedges have positive $277 million in estimated value at current strip. Its hedges cover approximately 70% of its projected Q4 2023 production, so Chesapeake is significantly protected against weak natural gas prices over the next few months.Chesapeake is now projected to generate $300 million in free cash flow in 2H 2023 before its investments in Momentum Sustainable Ventures. Including those investments reduces Chesapeake's projected 2H 2023 free cash flow to $90 million.At the end of Q2 2023, Chesapeake had $975 million in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash). It also has $1.95 billion in unsecured notes due between 2026 and 2029.Chesapeake's $0.575 per share quarterly base dividend may result in approximately $152 million in 2H 2023 dividend payments, based on its current share count. There probably won't be variable dividend payments for at least the next couple of quarters unless commodity prices improve, as Chesapeake is planning to invest over $200 million into Momentum Sustainable Ventures during the second half of the year.I've assumed that Chesapeake receives $550 million after purchase price adjustments from its SilverBow deal, with the price adjustments reducing the total received by $100 million due to the asset-level cash flow from February to the deal closing date.This results in a projection that Chesapeake ends up with $1.463 billion in cash at the end of 2023 before any share repurchases. Chesapeake is also due another $500 million in future (after 2023) installment payments from its Eagle Ford divestitures plus up to another $50 million in contingent payments.I now estimate Chesapeake's value at approximately $84 to $85 per share based on a scenario with long-term $3.75 NYMEX gas. This is based on a multiple of 4.5x EV to unhedged EBITDA and roughly 3,240 MMCF per day in production. This production level is the same as Chesapeake's projected production from its Haynesville and Marcellus assets.At that production level and a negative $0.50 differential, Chesapeake should be able to generate approximately $2.55 billion EBITDA. I've also included the value of Chesapeake's investment (at cost) in Momentum Sustainable Ventures and assumed that its roughly 13 million in outstanding warrants are exercised.Thus I believe that Chesapeake is roughly fairly valued at this time for a long-term $3.75 NYMEX gas scenario now that it has divested its Eagle Ford assets.Chesapeake Energy's Eagle Ford divestitures fetched it approximately $3.525 billion, although the actual cash receipts may be closer to $3.0 billion after purchase price adjustments. Chesapeake will also receive around $500 million of those proceeds in future years.The Eagle Ford asset sale prices were largely in line with my expectations and should result in Chesapeake having a slight amount of net cash at the end of 2023, including the installments it is still due to receive.As a pure natural gas producer now, I estimate Chesapeake's value at $84 to $85 per share at my long-term natural gas price estimate of $3.75. Thus I believe it is roughly fairly priced now.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brendan Krueger, Chief Financial Officer of Antero and Vice President of Finance.Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Antero's third quarter 2023 investor conference call. We'll spend a few minutes going through the financial and operating highlights, and then we'll open it up for Q&A. I would also like to direct you to the homepage of our website at www.anteroresources.com, where we have provided a separate earnings call presentation that will be reviewed during today's call.Today's call may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our earnings press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Joining me on the call today are Paul Rady, Chairman, CEO and President; Michael Kennedy, CFO; Dave Cannelongo, Senior Vice President of Liquids Marketing and Transportation; and Justin Fowler, Senior Vice PresidentI will now turn the call over to Paul.Thank you, Brendan. I'll start my comments on Slide number 3, titled drilling and completion efficiencies. After a record-breaking first half of 2023 operationally, we continued to build onThese cycle times reflects the total number of days it takes, on average, from first spudding a pad to turning that entire pad to sales. Since 2019, our cycle times have decreased by an impressive 65%, and averaged just 160 days through the first three quarters of 2023. In June, we had the fastest cycle times in our company history at 129 days, shorter cycle times means higher capital efficiency. Highlighting this point, we completed roughly 80% of our 2023 expected completion stages during the first nine months of 2023.Now let's turn to Slide number 4. Faster cycle times and improving well performance has led to two production guidance increases in 2023. This gain in capital efficiencies is highlighted by our 9% total production growth in the third quarter compared to the year-ago period. Our production growth was driven by an 18% liquids growth, while natural gas volumes increased 4% year-over-year. Looking at this on an annual basis, we now expect production this year to increase by 225 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 7%, from the exit rate in 2022 to the exit rate in 2023. Importantly, these capital efficiency gains also reduce our maintenance capital budget. We continue to expect materially lower D&C capital in 2024 driven by operational efficiency gains alone.Lastly, I'd like to discuss our multi-decade inventory position. Turning to Slide number 5 titled, AR has the lowest – the largest low-cost inventory. This chart compares inventory positions across our natural gas peer group based on data from a recent third-party report. Antero has the most sub $2.75 per Mcfe drilling inventory at 22 years. It's important to note that this inventory comparison is after our peers spent a combined $17 billion on acquisitions over the last two years. In contrast, we remain focused on our organic leasing efforts where we've invested some $340 million over that same time to acquire targeted drilling locations within our development footprint. On average, we have been able to add locations for approximately $1 million per location through this program. That is less than half of the over $2 million average cost per location for the peer acquisitions.Touching on the recent flurry of M&A headlines, in our opinion, drivers for M&A usually relate to either one, limited core inventory; two, a lack of pipeline capacity to move your production out of basin; or thee, balance sheet repair. With a peer-leading low-cost inventory position, the largest firm transportation portfolio in the E&P sector and low absolute debt and leverage, Antero can stay focused on improving operations which we believe drives ultimate shareholder value.Now to touch on the current liquids and NGL fundamentals, I'm going to turn it over to our Senior Vice President of Liquids Marketing and Transportation, Dave Cannelongo for his comments. Dave?Thanks, Paul. In the second half of 2023 we have seen an uptick in crude pricing as the macroeconomic concerns in the first half of the year have eased and new geopolitical concerns in the Middle East have increased the risk premium in the market. The most recent conflict has added volatility to global energy prices, particularly crude, with market fears of war spreading further in the Middle East.Turning to propane, while absolute propane inventories are high and prices as a percent of WTI lower than usual, fundamentals are painting a better picture in recent weeks. The U.S. recently set a new weekly record high for propane exports and printed two consecutive weeks above two million barrels per day. Overall, propane export demand has been consistently strong and has averaged 1.6 million barrels per day year-to-date, shown on Slide 6, about 250,000 barrels per day or 19% above the 2022 full year average.As we move into 2024, exports are expected to further increase causing potential tightness in U.S. Gulf Coast stock capacity. As a reminder, Antero exports over 50% of our C3+ production, skewed heavily towards propane in particular, directly out of the Marcus Hook terminal in Pennsylvania, and therefore, Antero's export volumes are not impacted by constraints at the Gulf Coast export docks. In fact, with tight capacity in the Gulf Coast and strong international pricing, Antero will be able to take advantage of its capacity out of Marcus Hook to capture these wide arbitrage opportunities.The growing call on propane exports has kept propane days of supply in line with historical levels. As seen on Slide 7, while total propane inventories sit just above the top of the five-year range, propane days of supply is currently just one day above the five-year average. Adding to the strong exports, seasonal demand will also start to increase in the fourth quarter as the market heads into the winter heating season. Strong heating demand this winter could quickly deplete the surplus that the mild 2022 to 2023 winter added to inventories last withdrawal season.Now let's turn to Slide 8 titled China PDH Buildout Continues. A major driver of strong propane exports this year has been growing demand from China, which has seen stronger year-over-year petrochemical demand despite some macroeconomic headwinds there. This year through August, 120,000 barrels a day of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity has been added in China. Industry estimates show that another 340,000 barrels a day of capacity is expected to come online between now and the end of 2024.Even with just one fourth of PDH capacity additions online that are expected over 2023 and 2024, the ramp in imports to China from the U.S. year-over-year has been substantial. For January through August this year, the amount of U.S. propane cargoes delivered to China increased by 44% year-over-year compared with a 19% increase year-over-year from the Middle East. This demonstrates that U.S. exports continue to make up the marginal increase required by Chinese propane demand.Meanwhile, on the U.S. supply side, rig counts continue to drop, now down 21% year-to-date as seen on Slide 9. This represents a drop of 163 rigs across both oil and gas directed rigs. Permian Basin rig counts are down 40 year-to-date and have accelerated decreases in recent weeks, falling to just above 300 total rigs, losing 20 rigs between the end of September and start of October.Additionally, key NGL-producing basins such as the Eagle Ford and Scoop Stack have seen their rig counts declined 35% and 45% year-to-date. Overall, we believe that with supportive fundamentals domestically and positive demand signals from China, there are signs of improvement for NGLs heading into 2024 and in particular, for producers like Antero with direct access to international markets.With that, I'll turn it over to our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Marketing, Justin Fowler, to discuss the natural gas market.Thanks, Dave. I will start on Slide number 10 titled Dramatic Reduction in Activity Will Limit Production Growth. Starting with the rig count chart at the top of the slide, we have seen the Appalachia plus Haynesville rig count declined by approximately 50 drilling rigs since the beginning of this year. This compares to the similar rig decline that we experienced back in 2019.As shown on the natural gas production chart at the bottom of the slide, it took over six months to materialize. However, U.S. natural gas production ultimately declined by as much as 10%. Further, it took almost two years to get back to the 2019 highs. Today, we are just about 6 months out from when rigs began to drop in a meaningful and sustained way. An important distinction this time around, however, is that over 70% of the rig declines this cycle have come from the higher decline in Haynesville Basin. A sharp contrast to 2019 when the majority of rig drops came from the lower decline in Appalachian Basin.In summary, we believe the sharp decline in rigs and completion crews will curb production growth in 2024, helping to balance the U.S. natural gas market. As a reminder, we sell substantially all of our natural gas out of basin, including approximately 75% to the LNG corridor, as shown on Slide number 11, titled Firm Transportation to the LNG Fairway.Our firm transportation portfolio provides us with direct exposure to growing LNG demand along the Gulf Coast and importantly, into Tier 1 pricing points along the Gulf Coast. Next, I'll turn to Slide number 12, titled Not All Firm Transportation to the Gulf Coast is Equal. This slide illustrates the significant benefit in selling your gas at Tier 1 Gulf Coast pricing. Based on the current strip, Tier 1 prices reflect increasing premiums to NYMEX in 2024 and 2025, including the TGP 500 line, where premiums have increased to $0.29 above NYMEX in 2026.Meanwhile, some peers claim they can move their gas to the Gulf Coast, but they're actually stuck in Tier 3, selling their gas at $0.24 back of NYMEX in both 2024 and 2025. The yellow stars on the map depict Antero sales points, which were strategically negotiated to bring our volumes directly to the LNG doorstep. As depicted in the pie chart on the top left of the slide, Antero sells 90% of its gas at Tier 1 pricing. This compares to the average of our peers, which sell 60% – 7% of their Gulf Coast directed volume into Tier 2 and 3 pricing.Looking ahead over the next two years as LNG export capacity increases by nearly 6 Bcf, we expect Antero sales points to be priced at even higher premiums to NYMEX as these LNG facilities compete for supply. A key competitive advantage between Antero versus our peers.With that, I will turn it over to Mike Kennedy, Antero's CFO.Thanks, Justin. First, I'd like to add some additional comments on how we view the outlook for natural gas. Slide number 13 examines the historical relationship between storage levels and natural gas prices. This chart illustrates the high correlation that storage and pricing have to each other. As you would expect, when storage levels are below or above the five-year average, natural gas prices are low. And when storage levels are below the five-year average, prices trend higher.Since 2020, which is essentially when the industry moved the maintenance production when storage levels are flat with the five-year level, natural gas prices averaged $4 per Mcf. Looking at 2023, storage levels rose to as high as 25% above the five-year average, resulting in negative sentiment and low gas prices. However, during the second half of 2023, record levels of power burn drove down this storage surplus, which sits at just 5% today. With production expected to moderate in the coming months and LNG exports hitting record highs, we anticipate storage levels will balance with the five-year average in 2024, thus providing support to natural gas prices.Expanding on this point, if you have today’s exact storage level, at this same time next year, your surplus would go from almost 200 Bcf over the five-year average today to a surplus of just 50 Bcf to next year’s five-year average.Next, I’d like to go a little deeper on the capital efficiency improvements that Paul touched on in his comments. The scatter plot on Slide number 14 illustrates the year-over-year change in production on the Y axis and the year-over-year change in drilling and completion capital on the X axis for the Appalachian E&Ps.While targeting a maintenance capital program Antero’s third quarter 2023 production actually grew 9% year-over-year. Conversely, while our peer group attempted to target a maintenance capital program, their volumes actually declined year-over-year. When you compare the production growth to the drilling and completion capital invested to deliver that growth, we have been far and away the most capital efficient operator in Appalachia.As a rule of thumb, internally, we view each $100 million change of capital to result in approximately $100 million day change in production both up and down. Exit rate 2022 to exit rate 2023, we expect production growth of $225 million per day, which implies that our capital efficiency gains and well performance have reduced true maintenance capital by roughly $225 million, all else equal. This implies a true maintenance capital budget to hold 2022 volumes of 3.2 Bcfe a day of approximately $650 million to $700 million.Looking ahead to 2024, our improved capital efficiency and well performance provides us with significant flexibility during our upcoming budgeting process to either hold our current third and fourth quarter volumes flat at capital approximately 10% lower than our 2023 capital or to hold our previously communicated maintenance volumes of 3.35 to 3.4 Bcfe a day at an even lower capital level. Either way, this lower capital outlook combined with a higher natural gas strip is expected to lead substantial free cash flow in 2024 and beyond.With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Bert Donnes of Truist. Please proceed with your question.Hi, good morning, guys. On the difference between the 10% lower capital program versus the meaningfully lower capital, you just addressed some of the questions, but what spurred the change in the messaging? Is it just the efficiencies you’re seeing? Is there some sort of investor feedback or are you looking at the strip and that changed your mind? Or was this always the plan? You just laid it out a little bit simpler for us the first time.Another change is our production is well ahead of expectations. We didn’t anticipate to be $225 million a day over exit rate to exit rate. We’ve now raised our guidance twice throughout the year. And we expect gross well head volumes in Q4 to be higher than Q3 as well. And so just the well performance, the capital efficiency, all those assumptions underlying those have improved. And so we have to figure out in this upcoming budget process, the assumptions that we use, how we risk those, we typically have some risking. That's why we always hit our numbers and go from there and see which levels we want to hit. We can dial in pretty much any production we want at any capital at the required capital level. So when you change those assumptions, it changes the capital. So 10% would be holding kind of the current run rate. We'd be 10% lower. But if we held the previously communicated guidance for maintenance capital, it'd be well below that 10%.That's great. And then my follow-up is kind of related. But say, the strip plays out, maybe we actually get a few cold winters. LNG demand doesn't get pushed out. You see an attractive growth environment, does Antero's kind of stable operations plan change? Or do you maybe stair step just up to a higher level and maybe hedge some of that risk away? I have a feeling some of your peers would probably try to respond to a bull and bear environment. But do you stay stable? Or with your new efficient program, maybe you could respond to the strip. That's all, thanks.No, we'd stay stable. We're trying to achieve maintenance capital. As we said, it just continues to improve. So ultimately, we'll get it to a level where the maintenance capital assumptions we have are equate to actuals. And so we'll stay at that maintenance capital program and then pay down the remainder of our debt and return capital to shareholders.Thanks so much.The next question comes from Umang Choudhary of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate all the details on the propane macro. I wanted to circle back on your thoughts around upside and both downside risk to propane prices heading into next year. Like you said, you are positive on propane demand for 2024 with the build out of PDH facility, but wanted to understand if you see any downside risk there. And also on the supply side, given healthy oil prices, do you see any risk of supply exceeding EIA expectations of around 50,000 barrels per day of growth next year?Yes. Good morning, Umang. On the propane side, I would say, the biggest risks we kind of highlighted in our comments on what could happen in the Gulf Coast with Mont-Bellevue pricing. If you see those docks really hit full utilization. We even saw here in the third quarter, three of the big four facilities had extended, planned or unplanned maintenance or I guess, third quarter into fourth quarter. That has driven some lower propane export numbers despite the records that we've reported.So I think we would have seen higher overall export numbers here in recent months and lower inventories than where we stand today had that not happened. But it points to the fact that those facilities are becoming increasingly higher utilized and that's really a big differentiator for Antero. If you go back to – I think, it was back in 2019, the first kind of full year we had Mariner East online, we had very high utilizations in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the arms were wide, they were $0.15, $0.20 to $0.25 a gallon. And you saw us capture that. And so that's ultimately something that we could see play out this year.Sorry for 2024, where you could have weaker Mont-Bellevue pricing like you've seen here in the third quarter, but strong arms in Antero. As we move into 2024, we do capture some of that value. Today, we have some contracts that are term deals that roll off before the end of the first quarter. And so beyond that, in 2024, we're fully uncontracted and able to capture that value. And so I think you'll see that reflected in our NGL realizations if that plays out like it's looking right now on the propane side. I think the other tailwind is just on the freight costs, you've seen freight costs stay elevated this year. We hit record levels a month or so ago and that's been driven by some delays getting through the Panama Canal, the well publicized low water levels that they have down there.And so that's again something temporary. And if you look at the futures curves for LPG freight costs, they're backwardated U.S. to Asia is about $0.12 per gallon lower by midsummer of 2024 versus now, and that's a pretty steady decline in those expected costs. So that'll also allow prices in the U.S. to rise as well as that freight cost declines.On the oil, nothing I think that we can provide specific to that. Obviously, there’s a lot of moving parts with geopolitical risks and OPEC. I do think we’re seeing, particularly on the GL side of supply responses, we’ve seen the rig count decline. You saw some very steep increases in U.S. propane inventories back in the spring, even though exports were strong. And as we moved through the back half of the year with similar levels on exports, you’ve seen those propane increases wane and we’ve come back into the five year range. So I think that to me, points to what we talked about with the ring counts where things are responding on the supply side here domestically as well. And we’ll have to see if that plays out on the oil side in 2024.Very helpful. Thank you so much for all the color. I guess the next question, which I had is I just wanted to follow-up on the operational momentum, which has been really strong here recently. Would love your initial thoughts on 2024 production and capital spending outlook and also if you can touch a little bit on deflation and what you’re expecting there too, which can probably add some upside to the 10% reduction number, which you were talking about from a capital spending perspective.Yes. We’re not baking in any deflation. My comments earlier were just addressing the operational efficiencies, capital program efficiencies and well performance that we’ve experienced this year. And assuming those type of efficiencies and performance will allow us to kind of dial in which capital we want, depending on whether we want to keep today’s production flat or what we communicated earlier, the kind of the annual average from last time of 3.35 to 3.4. So that’s what we’re in the process of doing this quarter. So we’ll go through our typical process and then come out with those. Generally, we come out with the budget with the February release, with the year-end release. So we’ll just work through that and continue to watch the market. But we’re not assuming any deflationary aspects in that capital budget. That would just be upside.That’s really helpful. Thank you.Thank you.The next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Yes. Mike, I wanted to get your thoughts on, so you said 10% lower CapEx next year, and that would be to keep the current production outlook, what you’re doing today relatively flat? And then if you drill down to 3.35 to 3.4, it would be more than 10%. Just wondering if you can clarify those comments.That’s correct. Yes.Okay. Got it. Got it. And then just I know it’s hard to estimate land spend because you’re opportunistic on that front. But if you’re recommending kind of a placeholder for land spend in 2024, any just broad thoughts on that?Yes. It was in the last comments we always target in a non – in a traditional year, unlike 2022, when we had a pretty big effort to increase that land position with the amount of free cash flow we had. But we typically always target $75 million to $100 million a year. That’s our traditional kind of customary commodity price environments. So that’s why you would assume this third quarter ratcheted down to $27 million, will be down in the fourth quarter from there, too. So that run rate is around we’re at like $100 million, but generally it’s $75 million to $100 million capital budget for land.Great. And just my follow-up, Mike is how do you think we should think about production costs next year? Obviously fuel costs, maybe some of the savings are transitory, but you got CPI inflators the AM escalator. But just give us a broad strokes around thinking about kind of production costs as we move into 2024?Yes, it’s really commodity price dependent. We pretty much have flat LOE next year. We do have an uptick of about $0.05 on production ad valorem taxes because that’s just commodity price, gas prices up $0.75, so that’s how you kind of get to that. And then similar on the GP and TUP a nickel as well just on the fuel cost. So assuming we have these increased a $3.50 type of commodity price next year, which is the strip, we’re up about a dime.A dime? What about the AM escalator?That’s baked into that dime.That’s baked into the dime. Okay. Thanks guys.The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Hey good morning. Thanks. I guess a couple of things I’d like to just dig into a little bit. As you think about the improvement you’ve shown in capital efficiencies without getting too granular on to the outlook, what is your expectation on how much further you can go with that?Well, that’s a good question. What improved from this year is, we are assuming coming into the year that we’d average about 8.7 stages per day in completions and then about six days to seven days per 10,000 in drilling, and we’ve improved two stages per day or more than that at 11 stages and completions and about a day improvement on the drilling. This time last year, I would have said that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve those improvements. So we’ll probably assume those same levels I just mentioned going into next year, but we’re always looking for continuous improvement.Paul mentioned the record completion of the 17 hours per day on the completion. It would be great to improve upon that, if you did, you can maybe get some out of the completion stages per day, but those are still probably industry-leading levels. So, I wouldn’t assume any improvement from there, but we’re always trying to achieve it.No, that’s fair. It’s certainly been a nice driver within the industry overall, but I’m glad to see you all at the top of the pack. The only other question I’ve got really is, is there anything we should think about as we look into, let’s just say, the next six months or so, that you would expect changes on realizations across your portfolio, meaning whether it’s the gas side or the NGL side? Or we should just basically look at kind of where we’ve been and think that’s the right way to look at things?No, we were wide in Q3 because of the maintenance on Cove Point, Tennessee pipe. So we sold about 15% to TCO, and that was wide in the third quarter. It’s always weak in the third and fourth quarters during the shoulder months going in the winter. That has improved quite a bit in Q4 those maintenance capital events have subsided. So we’ll sell a lot more in the Gulf Coast. And then when you look at the Gulf Coast going into the winter, those are actually at premium prices to Henry Hub, like Justin mentioned on his slide that interesting slide around the Tier 1 levels and goes right into the LNG corridor where there’s a lot of demand for the gas.We also have quite a bit going to Chicago during the winter, which may be up to $0.50 ahead of Henry Hub right now, and we’re bringing seven wells on in the Utica just in time to enjoy the Chicago gas prices filling our ex capacity. So I see realizations improving quite a bit in the fourth quarter and heading into 2024.All right. Thank you. I’ll leave it there.The next question is from David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Thanks for getting me on the call guys. Appreciate the time. Mike, you threw out some exciting numbers, I think, for the next year. The 650, I guess, true maintenance versus maybe an 800 to stay at that 3.5% level or so. Can you just talk about the variables that are influencing that decision? And I guess, as I think about it, is there a breakeven price? Is it $4 gas that would incentivize you to stay at a higher level. Are you being influenced by perhaps like some of the revolver balance that you have right now and wanting to accelerate max free cash in the beginning of the year. I guess, what would be the primary factors that you consider between those two variables?Yes, the 650 to 700 was what it would have been required to hold that 3.2 Bcfe a day flat. Total 3.35 to 3.4 would have been $100 million or so higher. As I mentioned, the rule of thumb is every $100 million a day of capital is $100 million a day of production. So higher than that to hold the 3.35, 3.4, but well below that 10%. It’s kind of how we think about it. It’s going to be somewhat commodity price dependent, David. We’re obviously heavily influenced by generating free cash flow and paying down all our debt and returning capital to shareholders. So that's ultimately the number one filter we use. We also want to be extremely capital efficient. So we do have kind of a two and a half rigs signed up for next year. So that's kind of the men case. And then we kind of have a floating, we have one completion crew and then a floating completion crew. So that's kind of how we manage capital. So we have the flexibility to do whichever program we choose or a variation in between. And that's something we'll have to consider as we go through this budgeting process and watch commodity prices over the next couple of months.It doesn't sound like as you think about like a multi-year progression, are you inherently more operationally efficient with sort of that three rig and two crew program?Yes, we're much more efficient that. And when you think about that, we have the drilling JV, so we really only have 85% of that. And this year's really a three rig program and a one and a half completion crew. Next year you're kind of looking at a two and a half rig and a one and a half completion crew, again, only having 85% and we can set that down the following year when the drilling JV ends. So we've just become remarkably efficient just with our continuous acreage position, having all the infrastructure in place, having all the transport, having all the processing, and then working on our operational efficiencies and having this much success. We've just continued to become more and more efficient drill terrific wells,Would you guys just mind updating us? It's all very helpful and just the shell cracker progression and some of the assumptions that we should thinking about your ethane volumes for next year?Yes. Nothing new to what they've guided publicly on. They're doing some work on one of the three downstream units that's expected to be wrapped up by the end of the year. So 2024, we expect to see significantly higher and more stable volumes from us going to that facility. And so you would expect to see that show up in our net production. We also have a handful of other customers that will be calling on us for more ethane on contracts that are ramping up in 2024 as well. So I think you'll see a combination of the shell cracker effect as well as others in the net production in 2024 on the ethane side.Yes. And then further to that, when it comes to the ethane cracker, we always risk that quite heavily. And that’s why you’ve seen with – even with the startup delays that we’ve had this year with the ethane cracker, we’re still well ahead of production guidance and we actually guided our ethane volumes down recently. So the production that we’re talking about levels will be risked for further kind of just startup – your typical startup issues. And then if the ethane cracker actually does perform a little bit better in the year, that’ll just be upside the volumes.Thanks, Mike. You answered my questions probably. I appreciate it, guys.Yes. Thanks.The next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. As you mentioned we’re seeing LPG export capacity tightness along the Gulf Coast. How much flexibility does Antero have to export more from the East Coast which I think has a little bit more spare capacity?Well. We do a pretty good job with that, in particular in the time of the year where you want to export as much as possible, which is the shoulder months, spring through summer and into the fall. There’s times of the year where we’re spending 85%, 90% of our propane to the international dock. So hard to really get much above that. But you want to leave some flexibility for domestic and for variations in production month to month, but we try and maximize that as much as we can during the non-heating season.Okay. That makes sense. And then you kind of touched on this on an earlier question, but your local gas realizations were a little bit lower due to maintenance at Cove Point in Tennessee. Was that kind of this perfect storm where it was also kind of poor basis because of the high storage and is that like a lot more maintenance than usual in the season? Or do you view it as just everything is more volatile now that everything’s quite full, that when there’s any maintenance event, it kind of blows out?Yes, that was a good way to put it. That was the perfect storm, the backup volumes from Cove Point and TECO [ph] and then the backup volumes from Tennessee and the TECO just led to really wide basis. It was historic. It was the high – whitespaces we’ve seen at TECO. So all of that is subsided though, going in the Q4 with Cove Point being back on in Tennessee flowing so.Great. That’s all for me. Thanks.Yes.The next question is from Jacob Roberts of Tudor, Pickering and Holt. Please proceed with your question.Good morning.Good morning.We appreciate the macro commentary and the detail you guys gave in the near to medium term. Just curious, and maybe a 2025 plus time frame, what you would need to see in the forward curve to potentially allocate more capital to dryer areas?Yes. I mean, good question. It's obviously always relative to liquids but liquids does have some constraints around processing. So you could envision a scenario if there is a call on gas, which we believe could have very much occur with the build-out of the LNG during that time frame you referenced that you would need more gas, and we have the ability to deliver more gas through our dry gas acreage inventory, you could see a scenario there.But right now, we just program in maintenance capital holding these levels flat and then enjoying the higher commodity prices and the free cash flow and paying down debt and buying back shares. But there is possibility if it goes quite high. We essentially have over 1,000 locations of premium dry gas inventory held by production over in our eastern half of the field. So we have that optionality, but right now, when you model it out, we'll just have maintenance capital.Appreciate it. That’s all for me.Yes.The next question is from Gregg Brody of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Good morning guys.Good morning, Gregg.Just on the volume decision, whether you keep 3Q, 4Q flat or what you originally thought you would be. How do you think about that and optimizing the Antero Midstream business? What's the – how you think through that.Yes. We don't really think about Antero Midstream. We think about Antero Resources and its free cash flow profile. Antero Midstream is just a beneficiary of the growth and capital efficiencies, and that all translates to them as well because they're getting much more production per well and it's very contiguous acreage, so very capital efficient. But we think from an AR perspective, how do we maximize free cash flow and the commodity price environment we're in.So if you have higher commodity prices that would and that's what the strip suggests, then that would lead most likely to try to maintain a higher production level; if you had lower commodity prices, more like 2023 type pricing on natural gas, you would probably favor a lower capital budget. So that's kind of what we look at. We definitely want to maximize free cash flow at AR and use it to pay down the debt and return capital.And just moving this consolidation, obviously, has been a big theme as of late. Obviously, you have a huge inventory that you can access. So there isn't necessarily a need to buy anything. But how are you thinking about that today? And then how does Antero Midstream fit into that discussion as well, if at all?Yes. Well, we're just focused on an organic leasing strategy. That's the best capital we can spend from an M&A perspective. And Antero Midstream gets all the acreage from AR dedicated. And when we acquired the acreage, we worked really hard and 99% of the time, it comes with free and clear from any midstream dedication. So it's immediately dedicated to Antero Midstream. So those acreage ads really benefit AM, and that's why they have over a 20-year life of inventory behind their midstream assets. So the acreage accrues to AM as well.But then just maybe bigger picture, just you're seeing a lot of peers get – there's discussions of peers getting bigger. I'm curious if that's making you think a little harder about M&A or status quo?No, we're focused on the operational efficiencies. I mean we've grown 9% year-over-year without doing M&A. So we are very operationally efficient. We've got no constraints. We've got all the acreage locations, the midstream, the processing, the firm transport to the LNG corridor, the balance sheet. So if you put that all together, there's really no need for M&A. And then when you look at our operational efficiencies, it's really hard for us think of any play that would compete for capital compared to our future programs. So that's why we're focused on the organic leasing.All makes sense and consistent with the past. And just one last one, something you said on the call, which I think it's consistent with what you've implied in the past. But I think you have this debt target near term, I believe it's about $1 billion. You made a comment about paying down the debt. Is there an actual goal to get debt at Antero Resources to zero? Or is $1 billion the right number?Yes, now again zero is the target.If you were to take a guess when that would happen by, when do you – is that just a function of paying down debt….Commodity prices – I would say that, like you mentioned, it's always been $1 billion is the goal. So the first – the free cash flow will go to that first. Then once you get to the $1 billion and below, that would get you out of the credit facility and the 2026 notes that are callable in January, then you look at it and say, well, maybe 50-50, probably a little bit more on the return of capital but it will just depend on commodity prices and where our bonds are priced.I mean our 2030s are 5.375 [ph]. So that's a good piece of paper, that's $600 million. So you may want to kind of keep that in the capital structure and buy back shares or return capital. But the other debt pieces are at pretty high interest rates that we'd like to take out.I appreciate the time guys and all the color. Thanks. Thanks.The next question is from Subash Chandra of Benchmark. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good morning. On the spot to sales improvement there over the years, I think a big element of that is just well sort of waiting on completion. So I guess my question is, can you describe sort of the path you took to reduce that time. And if you think that the program is going to maximize or I should say, minimize that variable going forward.Yes. We don't really have any waiting on completion. We try to plan all of our programs that it's just in time. So when you're done drilling the well, you're on that pad completing it as soon as possible. So that's how we do it. There may be a week here or there where there's some white – we call it white space in the schedule. But generally, we try to minimize that and be as efficient as possible and not have any DUCs because that's nonperforming capital.Yes. So I guess, several years back when it was 400 days plus, et cetera. What was different then?We can see our on that Slide 3, the pumping hours have almost – are up like 65%. That's an 86% increase in completion stages per day and then the drilling times to have a greatly improved. So it's a combination of both. But to go from 427 [ph] year-to-date, 160, it's over 60% reduction and that 160 is definitely sustainable.Got it. Okay. And just a clarification, I guess, on the debt reduction question. Zero, I guess, is the ultimate target, I guess, bank debt is there, I would assume, as a top priority to reduce the zero first? And is that sort of.Yes.Is that sort of a priority before there's meaningful share buybacks? Or how do you sort of balance the two?Yes. The goal is always, and we had zero bank debt essentially or near zero coming into the year. So that would be the first use of the free cash flow is paying down that credit facility, then after that, it would be over 50% to return to shareholders. But we also have the 2026 notes. There's less than $100 million on the callable in January. So I would kind of lump that together with the credit facility.Thanks Mike.Yes. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Brendan Krueger for closing remarks.Yes. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Please reach out with any further questions. Thank you.This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",4,2023-10-26T14:50:27.000-04:00
Hard Times Bring Big Income: Enterprise Products,"There's a famous saying that ""hard times make strong men and strong men bring good times."" I've never truly agreed with this viewpoint because, regardless of whether you're in good times or hard times, greatWhen it comes to day-to-day life, we often find that the products that present themselves as being the most reliable, are sometimes the ones that fall the hardest. I enjoy watchingAs the market continues to struggle under the heavy weight of high interest rates and the economy continues to falter as well, we're seeing that a number of companies that presented themselves as strong or capable and even had strong fundamental performance are starting to falter. Investors often judge a management team solely by recent share price action. When share prices are rising, they rave about how ""great"" management is. In reality, some management teams were making rash decisions to bolster near-term growth at the expense of long-term security.Rising interest rates put pressure on the prices of most investments, especially investments where the main attraction is yield. After all, investors who want yield have the option to invest in U.S. Treasuries at much higher yields than they had a few years ago. Additionally, the entire purpose of raising interest rates from the perspective of the Federal Reserve is to increase the cost of capital and discourage growth. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for companies to expand and provide an incentive for them to slow down.During this period, the prior decisions of management will be cast in a new light, and many companies are going to need to make tough decisions about how far they are willing to extend to maintain growth, or whether it is prudent to slow down even if it is unpopular among shareholders.Investors today should favor stable and steady over speed. Today, we are going to take a look at an MLP that has chosen the stable and steady route. With a conservative payout ratio and methodical growth, over short periods many peers have seen faster growth rates. Yet when tough times arrive, its stable and steady business model really shines and outperforms.Gas and oil have been the exception, as very strong fundamentals have overridden the negative headwinds created by rising interest rates.  (), yielding 7.3%, is an MLP (Master Limited Partnership) that is particularly well-positioned to thrive, even in a tight monetary environment. is a rare MLP in that it is fully self-funding. It does not rely on issuing equity or debt to fund growth capital expenditures. Instead, it is able to fully fund cap-ex, the dividend, and buybacks from CFFO (Cash Flow From Operations): (Additionally, with a diversified business model, EPD is not reliant on any one commodity - natural gas, NGLs, oil, petrochemicals, and refined products are all part of EPD's business.EPD's ""slow and steady"" approach to the MLP model has proven to be extremely beneficial to shareholders over the years. EPD could have raised its dividend more aggressively and kept distribution coverage in the 1.4x range. Instead, EPD opted to moderate growth and turn to a fully self-funded structure. This has meant slower growth of the distribution but also an increasingly safe distribution.Investors are really seeing the benefit of this conservative structure now; as many companies struggle with the cost of capital, EPD has the luxury of not needing to worry about the cost of debt.EPD's existing debt is locked into low interest rates, with an average rate of 4.6% and an average maturity of 19.7 years.EPD is a great option to enjoy a great dividend today, enjoy dividend growth, and have the confidence that it can ride out any turbulence the market has to offer.With EPD, we're able to unlock strong income from a company that has been around for decades. Unlike so many other companies that claim to have strength, EPD, through the decades, has proven that they are capable of providing strong returns to their unitholders when good times are here or when hard times are here. Interestingly, while being the grandfather of so many other MLPs as far as style and relevance, the attractiveness of EPD has come and gone in waves. At times, investors claim that many other investments are better; all the while, this company has continued to generate outstanding income that is growing for its unitholders. As hard times in the market return, companies like EPD are the ones that people are going to start returning to and looking at again with a new level of appreciation after having been turned by others claiming to be just as strong.As an income investor who loves to receive strong income, I need to note that look no further than a chart like the one above to know that EPD, whether it's attractive or not to others, will remain a staple in my portfolio. Currently, it offers a +7% yield, making it still more attractive than even common money market funds, on top of the fact that they're also going to be raising their distribution on a regular basis.You don't need to be chasing what is the new vogue thing or the latest fad investing. Currently, AI is all the buzz. Previously, we had the Blu-Ray versus HDDVD debate. Does anyone remember HDDs versus SSDs? Or maybe it was the Apple iPod versus the Microsoft Zune for you? So many battles or fads come and go. Yet, through all of those periods of time, we were able to enjoy strong income from holdings like EPD, which often falls into the background noise of the market. There are very few investors who don't know that EPD exists, but simultaneously, so many of them shrug it off as a boring investment that their grandfather held. Perhaps, just like that old axe or hammer that your grandfather still has, EPD is worth another consideration for its strength.At the end of the day, I want you to be able to enjoy your retirement, having an abundance of income pouring into your account quarter after quarter, month after month, year after year; so much income that you don't have to worry about selling your shares to afford your daily bread. Instead, I want you to have so much income that you are able to choose a charity of your choice to be able to donate to without wondering where you're going to need that money in the future. I want you to be able to pursue your passions without the worry of financial calamity on the horizon. I want you to have a dream retirement - you don't need to be rich to have that!

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.I would like now to turn the conference over to Deck Slone, Senior Vice President of Strategy. Please go ahead.Good morning from St. Louis, and thanks for joining us today. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this call, including statements relating to our expected future business and financial performance may be considered forward-looking statements according to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, address matters that are to different degrees uncertain. These uncertainties, which are described in more detail in the annual and quarterly reports that we file with the SEC may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.I’d also like to remind you that you can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we plan to discuss this morning at the end of our press release, a copy of which we have posted in the Investors section of our website atAlso participating on this morning’s call will be Paul Lang, our CEO; John Drexler, our COO; and Matt Giljum, our CFO. After our formal remarks, we’ll be happy to take questions.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul?Thanks Dick and goodI'm pleased to report that during the third quarter, the Arch team continued to drive forward with our simple, consistent and actionable plan for long term value creation and growth. During the quarter just ended, the Arch team achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $126.3 million, generated $86.5 million in discretionary cash flow, invested $28.2 million to repurchase nearly 216,000 shares, and finally declared a quarterly cash dividend of $21.6 million, or $1.13 per share. In short Q3 served to underscore yet again, the value driving of Arch's capital return program, which we view as the centerpiece of our value proposition. Since February 2022 we've deployed more than $1.2 billion through the program, including the reduction of the equivalent of 4.3 million shares in the form of common stock, and convertible note repurchases, plus the issuance of nearly $662 million in dividends, inclusive of the payment to be made to shareholders in December. When combined with phase one of the program during the 2017 through 2019 time period, we've now returned more than $2.1 billion to shareholders. To review the central tenet of the capital return program would be the commitment to effectively return 100% of our discretionary cash flow to shareholders, a commitment that is foundational to the program structure. In contrast, we view the program's capital allocation model, which is to say the precise manner in which the capital is returned to be flexible and dynamic. Indeed, the Board evaluates capital allocation model on a more or less continual basis as an endeavor to ensure that capital is returned to shareholders in the most optimal way. Recently, and as a function of that ongoing evaluation process, the Board concluded that an adjustment to the capital allocation model made sense at this time. As a result, the Board decided to ratchet down the relative weighting to dividend, while at the same time preserving a meaningful cash balance that can be diverted towards share repurchases during periods of market weakness. It's important to highlight here that the Board continues to view a significant dividend as the integral component of Arch's long term capital return strategy. We believe that the return of cash is a clear, direct and unambiguous way to reward shareholders for their continuing support and confidence. But at present, we believe that directing a larger percentage of our discretionary cash flow to share repurchases makes sense given Arch's ongoing progress on its key strategic objectives, the company's promising long term outlook and the ongoing evolution of the preferences of Arch's shareholders. Turning now to the market dynamics, we've seen a significant strength in the global coal markets in recent months, despite continuing weakness in the macro environment. Let's start with global coking coal markets where High-Vol A coal Arch's principal product is being assessed at $277 per metric ton off the East Coast of the United States, which is a strong price level when compared to historical averages. What's more interesting in our view, is that coking coal prices continue to trace these elevated levels, despite relatively weak steel market dynamics. As an indication of this weakness, global output of hot metal, the end use the vast majority of Arch's coking coal is down roughly 1% year-to-date, falling the decline of nearly 10% in 2022 counterbalancing that weak demand environment to a large degree are continuing constraints in metallurgical coal supply. Year-to-date, coking coal exports from Australia, the largest supplier of metallurgical coal to seaborne market, are undershooting the already weak 2022 levels by roughly 5 million tons and heading to an over 35 million ton, or almost 20% decrease from their high watermark in 2016. Meanwhile exports from the United States and Canada, the other major sources of high quality coking coal supply to the seaborne market remained relatively range bound, despite persistently strong pricing in recent years. As we've noted repeatedly, the global investment in new and existing mine capacity has been extremely muted the last several years due to increasing development costs, mining regulatory pressures, and a host of other ESG-related concerns. And we see no evidence of that changing in the near future. Indeed, we suspect that even a modest improvement in global macroeconomic conditions could drive additional supply tightness well into the future. As for the seaborne thermal coal markets, we see a similar dynamic, with lackluster demand being counterbalanced by years of under supply. While our thermal assets are effectively sold out at fixed prices for 2023 we expect current thermal market dynamics and pricing levels should they persist, to support substantial margins on our thermal export volumes in 2024 and beyond. Looking ahead, we remain sharply focused on delivering operational excellence consistently quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year, capitalizing on while we expect to be constructive seaborne coal markets well into the future, maintaining and augmenting our already strong financial position, continue to reward shareholders for their support and confidence through our capital return program, and advancing our industry-leading sustainability practices. Through these substantial and ongoing efforts we're laying a strong and durable foundation for growth and long term value creation, as well as setting the stage for ongoing improvements in our mid-cycle free cash flow generation. I'll now turn the call over to John Drexler for further discussion of our operational performance in Q3. John? Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paul just discussed, the Arch team delivered solid results, and $86.5 million in discretionary cash flow despite constrained advance rates at Leer South during the third quarter. Our core metallurgical segment delivered higher per ton realizations and stronger cash margins on a sequential basis, while maintaining a cost structure that, while elevated relative to expectations, placed us comfortably in the first quartile of U.S. coking coal producers. In addition, our thermal segment delivered solid supplemental cash flows, well in excess of its capital requirements, despite a roughly breakeven performance at West Elk. In short, our talented workforce and high quality operating portfolio continue to deliver significant value for shareholders, even as we address some near term challenges and laid the foundation for stronger results in the future. I also want to highlight the continuing upward trajectory of the metallurgical portfolio on a year-over-year basis. First, it's worth underscoring that the Arch team is on track to ship around 1.3 million more tons of coking coal in 2023 than we did in 2022, based on the midpoint of our full year guidance. That's a significant step up clearly with substantial upside going forward. Second, I want to highlight the fact that we are guiding to metallurgical segment cash costs of less than $90 per ton at the midpoint of our full year guidance, which would be approximately 5% lower than our average cash costs in 2022. Again, that's a market reduction, particularly in the face of inflationary pressures that continue to push costs higher across the industry. But the most noteworthy aspect of this upward momentum is that we fully expect to drive continued progress on both these key metrics as we finish the year and move into 2024 followed by an even further step change in execution in 2025. The primary driver behind this positive outlook is the expected improvement in operational execution at Leer South. Let me be clear, Leer South is a very good mine today, at its current run rate of approximately 3 million tons per year. During its first two years of operation, it has contributed $470 million of segment level EBITDA against an initial capital investment of $400 million. Moreover, it has contributed significantly to the step down that we have achieved in our operating costs from 2022 to 2023, and is on track for what we expect to be incrementally stronger results in 2024. But what is most exciting, is its strong potential to become a great mine on the order [ph] of Leer in 2025 as we transition into the second long wall district. Of particular note, we have greatly expanded the drilling program at Leer South to ensure that we have a clearer picture of the geology, which should greatly enhance our ability to optimize the mine plan. And that expanded drilling program is reaffirming what we have long believed that the seam thickness in District 2 is approximately 20% greater than in District 1. This [ph] quite obviously means that we will be cutting more coal and less rock, which should drive significant improvements in coal yield. At the same time cutting less rock means less wear and tear on equipment, which should contribute further to the productivity enhancement. Of course, this is mining and there is always the potential for surprises, both positive and negative. But we remain confident and highly enthusiastic about the outlook for Leer South and its potential to shift into an even higher gear in coming quarters. Let's now spend a few minutes discussing the thermal segment. As indicated, the Powder River Basin assets performed at a high level once again in Q3 as they managed cost effectively while delivering a solid margin. This strong execution resulted in a substantial contribution to overall cash generation, which in turn counterbalanced an effectively breakeven performance by West Elk. The good news is that West Elk has now progressed into a new area of the reserve and is back in thicker and higher quality coal. While we are still endeavoring to make up for some of the shipments missed in Q2 and Q3, we expect a much stronger contribution from West Elk in Q4 and throughout the course of 2024. Then in mid-2025, the West Elk long wall will transition into the V seam, where the coal is markedly thicker, and the quality is substantially higher. In short, the outlook for West Elk, which is one of the few remaining high quality low cost [indiscernible] coal mines is very promising. Now let's discuss our marketing efforts in Q3. Starting with our recently signed North American coking coal commitments. Our marketing team was successful in achieving positive outcomes with several North American customers. And we have committed to ship approximately 1.5 million tons of coking coal to these customers in 2024, at an average fixed price of $158 per ton. As we have stated many times in the past we are happy to place volumes into the North American market when we can secure an appropriate price for the value and use of our high quality product slate. By the same token, we are well equipped to move 100% of our coking coal volumes into the dramatically larger seaborne market at index pricing when North American pricing dynamics are less favorable. We are pleased with our success in placing North American volumes for delivery in 2024 and equally pleased with the large percentage of our 2024 output that will be directed into the seaborne market. On the thermal side of the house, we are moving quickly towards sold out status for our Powder River Basin operations in 2024. We have also placed virtually all the West Elk tons for 2024 with approximately one-third of those times exposed to export pricing. As always, the single greatest achievement of the Arch team is its ability to continually deliver excellence across a wide range of sustainability metrics. During the first nine months of 2023 Arch's subsidiary operations have achieved an aggregate total loss time incident rate of 0.42 per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is approximately five times better than the industry average. At the same time Arch's subsidiaries once again recorded zero environmental violations and zero water quality exceedances during Q3. I am also proud to report that the U.S. Department of Interior recently honored Arch's Powder River Basin operating subsidiary as the sole recipient of the 2023 Excellence in Coal Mining Good Neighbor Award, the nation's top honor for community engagement. This marked the third time in five years an Arch subsidiary has been so honored. In addition, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recently honored the Leer Mine with its Mind Safety and Health Technology Innovation Award for the coal sector. On behalf of the entire senior management team, I want to express my admiration for, and appreciation to the Arch workforce for their tremendous efforts in this absolutely critical area of performance. With that I will now turn the call over to Matt for some additional color on our financial results. Matt. Thanks, John. And good morning. I'll begin with the discussion of cash flows and liquidity. For the third quarter, operating cash flow totaled $131 million, which included a working capital benefit of $16 million. Working capital benefit was lower than anticipated as shipment timing and the increase in metallurgical prices towards the end of the quarter led to additional growth in accounts receivable. Capital spending for the quarter totaled just over $44 million and discretionary cash flow was $87 million. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $214 million and total liquidity of $337 million, including availability under our credit facilities that at September 30 was $131 million resulting in net cash of $82 million. All this is clearly a strong financial position. It is worth noting that cash and liquidity were at their lowest level in two years, and at the lower end of our targeted range. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in operating cash flows. As always, working capital trends will be largely determined by net pricing. But at this point, we would anticipate a benefit in Q4 with the magnitude similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. Capital spending in Q3 was not as high as we had anticipated, with some planned expenditures delayed into the fourth quarter. We now expect fourth quarter CapEx to be roughly in line with third quarter spending. Moving on to our capital structure, we continue to reduce the overall diluted share count over the course of the third quarter, repurchasing nearly 216,000 shares. On a year-to-date basis, share repurchases now total just under 1 million shares at an average purchase price of $124 per share. Combined with the first quarter convertible bond settlement, the total impact of the repurchases represents 7% of the beginning of the year diluted shares outstanding. Just as importantly, we reached a significant milestone in early October, completing the process of simplifying our capital structure. At the beginning of the year the diluted share count included both the remaining convertible bonds and warrants, which in total comprise more than 1.5 million shares at that time. We repurchased the final convertibles earlier this year, and virtually all the remaining warrants were exercised by their expiration date in early October. As expected, the warrant activity increased our basic share count but had no material impact on the diluted count. Moving forward, there will be minimal difference between our basic and diluted share count. And we believe this simplicity has value. As we increase the weighting of share repurchases under our capital return program, long term shareholders will have a growing claim to our underlying production and earnings as well as growth in per share dividends over time. Finally, I will remind everyone that the capped call that we purchased at the time of the convertible bond issuance remains outstanding. The intrinsic value of the capped call remains approximately $62 million, an amount that is not reflected in our financial statements or otherwise factored into our fully diluted share count. We have the ability to exercise the capped call on or before its maturity date in the fourth quarter of 2025 and can elect to receive either cash or shares. If we elect to exercise prior to the maturity date, the amount we have received is the fair value at that time. Before turning the call over for questions, I wanted to make some final comments related to the capital return program. First, as Paul mentioned, the Board has declared a dividend of $1.13 per share based on the third quarter cash flows. The dividend will be paid on December 15 to stockholders of record on November 30. Paul also mentioned our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders and thus far this year we have demonstrated that commitment. Including the dividend announced today, combined dividends, share repurchases and convertible bond repurchases, net of proceeds from warrant exercises totaled nearly $343 million year-to-date, which is actually slightly more than our discretionary cash flow over that same time period. With that, we are ready to take questions. Operator, I will turn the call back over to you.We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris LaFemina from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just a question on the capital return policy and the framework. So now we have 25% targeted for dividends of the discretionary cash flow and up to 75% for buybacks. And Paul, did you say that that 75%, the portion of that will be used for buybacks sort of depends on what your share price is. So if you think you can accumulate cash on the balance sheet and either get an opportunity to buy shares cheaper later, that is what you would do? Or should we expect that entire 75% of discretionary cash flow to be used as buybacks in real time?Yeah, Chris, thanks. Look, I think as we look at the cap return program, it's been very successful. And as I noted, it's hit a lot of our expectations. And as we look at this change that we just announced, which is changing the relative weighting, what we'd like to do is, first and foremost, try and be a little more responsive to shareholders, plus be a little more opportunistic. So I could see a situation where in strong markets, we build a little bit of cash on the balance sheet, then when -- we're going to stick [ph] with business, when the market goes down, we'll hit the share repurchases heavily. And look, I think it's kind of a smart way to do it. But I think the fundamental thing for shareholders is the program really hasn't changed. And when you look back over time we'll hit those targets of returning cash to shareholders. We're just going to be a little more selective how we do it. Right. So I guess the follow up question on that is, if you're in a position, let's assume that your share price is 20%, 30%, higher than where it is today, and you're accumulating cash on the balance sheet. Do you worry about that sending a message to the market, that your stock is potentially overvalued? I understand the point about buying it on the weakness but not buying it on strength? I think, do we worry about sending a perverse message about kind of what the real value is in the equity? Does that question make sense?It makes sense, and it's one we've talked about quite a bit. Look, I think you'll see that we'll probably be in the market, at all times. I think what we'll do, though is we may be heavier at some times and less in others. As I look back to last quarter we were in the blackout and couldn't take advantage of it when the share price was at the bottom end of the spectrum here, around $115 or $120, at the start of Q3. It would have been nice to be able to jump in at that time. And I think what we're looking at is just trying to take advantage of that. So look, I wouldn't be surprised we build a little cash, one quarter and we use it the next. But the intent is, as I said, to ultimate return the cash that we've allocated for share buybacks to share buybacks. Chris, I would say, it's Deck, and that capital preservation piece has been part of the formula since the very beginning, with always that same view that building a little bit of a war chest, it can be useful, but it's probably not a big enough number where you're going to note it, but we certainly understand the question and the concern.Understood, thank you. Appreciate that. Good luck. Thank you. The next question comes from Katja Jancic of BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Maybe on the Leer South, I think you mentioned that you expect production to improve next year. Can you talk a little bit more about what the actual production could be at Leer South?Yeah, so as we reported with Leer South and some of the challenges we've experienced here, most recently in the panel that we began mining in, in mid July, panel five, we've been disappointed with some of the production that we've had. It's been driven by some of the geologic challenges, the thinning of the coal seam that we saw. That was not expected. As we transition out of that panel, which we expect to occur later in this quarter, we'll be heading into other panels here in the remainder of district one that we think get us back into the type of geology we saw on panels three and four, where we saw better production levels to the tune that would put us on a pace of around 3 million tons on an annual basis. So as we look at -- we transition into 2024, we're comfortable kind of with how we're going to move forward. Where we're really excited though, is the opportunity as we finish mining in district two and head into district -- I'm sorry, finished mining in district one, head into district two, we see a meaningful improvement in the coal seam height. We're substantiating that with the drilling. We see a 20% improvement and as a result, we would expect volumes to approach those that we would see with Leer, at for 4, 4-plus million tons on an annual basis. And Katja, just as a reminder, in Q1 and Q2, we produced more than 800,000 tons per quarter at Leer South, which is very much on that track for sort of that 3 million ton run rate. So we expect that to continue to be back in that sort of range throughout 2024. And for Q4 look as John just said, we're still on panel five, and we'll be in it for about half of this quarter. And then we transition to panel six. So somewhere between, the 520,000 tons we produced in Q3 and that more like 800,000 ton run rate in Q4 is probably what to expect. Again, because we're in panel three -- panel -- sorry, panel five for part of the quarter. And then as John said, I think just to reiterate, look at 3 million tons per year Leer South is a really good mine. It's a low cost mine, it's a highly productive mine. It's just not where it's going to be and where we expect it to be in 2025.And what should the cost be at let's say 3 million tons per year?As we look at our overall met segment, what we've guided to here for 2023, at the midpoint puts us at $89.50. As we move into 2024 and expect improvement at Leer South, I think we hope to be able to maintain that cost structure, if not improve on it with some improvement in volumes as we go forward. Leer South, clearly, even at a 3 million ton a year pace is in the first quartile of the cost structure. And so it's a good mine. And it's going to continue to work to get to that great status as we go forward in the portfolio.Okay, and then maybe shifting gears to PRB, I think you mentioned you're almost sold out for next year. Can you talk a bit about what volume that looks and what pricing is?Yeah, so as you look at our Powder River Basin operations, we're in that 60 plus million ton kind of volume between Black Thunder and Coal Creek as we wrap up, 2023. As we step into 2024, we've been real pleased with the book that we've built, the pricing associated with that book as being responsive to what we're seeing with the market. There may be a modest reduction, but it would be a small reduction from the levels that we see here currently in 2023, from a shipment level perspective. We haven't given guidance. We're still working through the budget on that front, but wouldn't be that different -- significantly different from what we're seeing here in 2023. And Katja as we've discussed, look our expectation is that the market overall probably steps down in the pace of something like 10% per year. We're very comfortable. If that's what the market requires from us, we're very comfortable with stepping down that same sort of level. We will standard still generate significant cash from the PRB assets. We will still maintain a good solid margin at the PRB asset now. If in fact supply changes in some way, and then we're prepared to maintain more than 60 million level, but again, very much prepared for a gradual reduction over time, if in fact, the market continues to, decline at that kind of pace.Okay, thank you. I'll hop into queue. Thank you, Katja.The next question comes from Nathan Martin from Benchmark. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys.Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Nate.This may be starting on the coking coal side. Based on my math, looks like 4Q shipments flattish kind of get you to the midpoint of your full year guidance. What could possibly drive it to the top or low end of that range? Is it Leer South performance? Is it logistics? Would just be great to get your thoughts there? And then a lot of talk about improvements at Leer South, kind of that step change in '25. But how should we think about the potential for coking coal shipment growth in 24 before we do move into that second long wall district? Thanks.Yeah, no good questions. I think as we look to the remainder of the year, it's a combination of production logistics. As you guys know, all of that factors into where ultimately that volume is going to go and why we typically have that range that's out there. But we're comfortable with the guidance range that we have out there, and our ability to achieve it. As you step into next year, with our expectation that you're going to see, Leer South kind of in that 3-plus million ton a year run rate, you've got Leer that should be comfortably above four, you've got the two other continuous miner operations, Beckley and Mountain Laurel executing well at a million tons a year on an annual basis. We have not provided guidance yet. We're deep in the budget process. But I think we should be comfortably above, 9 million tons at the midpoint, as we look into '24. And then with ongoing growth as we move further into 25, as we get into district two with Leer South. Appreciate that, John. And then maybe also a bit of a modeling question on thermal side for the fourth quarter. I think you guys previously said roughly 60 million tons or so PRB sales. If I assume West Elk, 3.5 or 4, that gets near close to 64 million for the full year. But that would imply a pretty big step down in thermal shipments in the fourth quarter. Am my thinking about that correctly, am I missing something, any update there?So I guess the midpoint of the guidance on the thermal side that we're showing is 65 million tons. You're at, call it 60 to 63 million tons in the Powder River Basin. You're probably at West Elk at that number that you described, around 3 million, 3 million-plus tons. And then you also have to factor in at least on the thermal side, the mids that we show in the guidance table, which I think we've got 700,000 tons. So approaching a million tons on that basis is kind of what we're expecting shipments to be.One of the things, that's always a little bit confusing, and I think if you look back, you've seen the same thing last couple of quarters. We've guided below our sales on the thermal side. And that's just the reality of what we were seeing earlier in the year where we thought, customers are going to ask for rollover or pushback tons. And as I say, we're quite happy to accommodate them, as long as we achieve the same value or a little bit more. And that's what we're anticipating with some of that guidance.Got it. Appreciate that, guys. And then maybe just curious, John, you're talking about West Elk, stick with that for a second. Kind of like production in 2025 could take another step up, when you hit bigger, higher quality coal? What does that production level look like versus maybe on a more normal run rate today?Yeah, so, as we worked through the challenges that we had in the Sunset district panels at West Elk, we've transitioned out of those. We've moved to another area of the reserve. The long walls gotten up and going, and things are going well there. We've got to manage a few things. We got some tons that we still need to ship from volumes that we missed in the first two quarters, and we'll continue to manage that. But as we step into next year, at West Elk, our expectation is we should be around that 4 million ton a year level. And then as we step into the B seam, in 2025, there's further opportunity with that better quality coal, more consistency in the thickness to ramp it back up to levels that we've seen before, at West Elk, where you're approaching 4.5, 5 million tons on an annual basis. West Elk, we think a great opportunity to access the export market. The coal's well received. It's a great quality coal into the international markets. Right now, as we look at '24, about a third of the volume that we have is exposed to those markets. And we're excited where West Elk is getting itself to as it moves forward. The B seam is, as John said, appreciably better quality, and you're looking at a step up in BTUs of 400 to 500 BTUs per pound. So significant step up and appreciably better than the Newcastle sort of quality. So that's another aspect of the story. Not only is the coal thicker, and as John said, gives us that opportunity to move back to sort of 5 million tons potentially even above that at West Elk, but also just that higher quality is going to make it that much more attractive in the seaborne market. And it's already a really good Newcastle look alike, in fact, a little better than Newcastle.I think, what's lost in all this is, we really view West Elk as a long term asset for the company. Its access to the seaborne market, particularly what's going into Asia, based on Newcastle pricing is really pretty exciting. Say the B seam we've got a lot of experience mining the B seam, and when we get down to it, it's excellent, the quality goes up considerably and it's a very good product and it gives a lot of advantage, in particular the Japanese markets.Great color there guys. And if I may, just one more. Don't want to leave Matt out. What's kind of driving the CapEx increase, about $10 million at the midpoint? I think Matt, you mentioned some CapEx to occur in the fourth quarter. But is there anything particular there to note?A lot of that Nate really is just timing. And I'll let John chime in, if he's got anything to add. A lot of it is just timing of when we receive things. Obviously with some of the supply chain lags that we've seen, trying to predict when those things are going to arrive certainly is not as easy as it once was. The other thing I would mention is we are bringing on some additional equipment, as we look into next year, trying to find opportunities to expand production, where it makes sense as we go into the 2024 timeframe.Yeah, I think Matt said it well. You can get a little lumpy here, when you've got some lead time items that are 18, 24 months out trying to predict exactly when they're going to come in is difficult. So we're glad to get some of the stuff that we got. We'll get it in place. I think we've discussed in the past, as we move forward, and we're not providing specific guidance yet, but we would expect future years of CapEx to be in similar ranges to what we've seen in the last couple of years as well. So we feel good about kind of how we're managing all that and moving forward.Very helpful, guys. Appreciate the time. Best of luck in the fourth quarter. Appreciate, Nate.The next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, Michael. So Paul, I think is very appropriate to be cautious on outlook for U.S. thermal consumption, regarding your PRB assets. But maybe can you remind us, over the next, how do you look at the mine plans over the next 5 to 10 years, given what maybe you would have thought when you instituted your reclamation, and your [indiscernible] plan, relative to what consumption's been, what utility customers are saying. I mean, there's been -- even though they've talked about net retirements in coal, there's been some plants that need to stay on for grid and other type reasons. So is there a chance that maybe you can accelerate some of those future cash flows into some of the near term years, and given where your plan is right now maybe what your customers are thinking, recognizing that you want to be cautious on expectations on thermal demand?Michael, I'll start out here, I'm sure a few others will weigh in, but real proud of, of the team in the Powder River Basin and the way they've managed in that declining market environment. And as you know, you don't have to go back that far, a decade, decade-plus where we were, mining out of the Powder River Basin, well in excess of 100 million tons on an annual basis. So the team has done an incredible job modifying the mine plans effectively, managing production and still maintaining a very healthy margin and managing the cost structure, which as you know, is difficult in our business as volumes are declining. It's hard to predict where things are going to go. But we continue to see that trend downward. The team's very focused on being in that position to maintain those costs and maintain those margins to generate cash. All through that cycle, we have done an outstanding job of managing the reclamation footprint. We've been shrinking the profile of the operations. You can look at Coal Creek, where we still have some modest volume, where it makes economic sense to do so. Yet, we've roughly closed, 80% to 90% of that operation, and quite frankly essentially, fully reclaimed it. So real proud of the team there. When opportunities present themselves in the market, the team has responded very well, to optimize the production with the fleet of equipment that we kind of essentially shrunk down to. And we would expect that there may be those types of opportunities as we go forward, and we'll fully be prepared to execute on those as we go ahead.Mike, as I look at the PRB, I still have a relative positive view. I mean, I think we're set up well. I think the key to success with PRB is being very flexible. We've been -- we've done a very good job of cutting our costs, as we've dropped production, and kept the margins in a fairly good line. Going forward, the key to future success is going to be the same. Watching costs and being very careful about the capital we put in. But I feel pretty good. We got pretty good clarity in the next five years. And at the end of the day, the thermal mine reclamation fund was created just a real easy option for us out there. And I think we're set up to play it well. The team out there has done a great job, and I still have a little bit of optimism for the operation.Mike it's Deck. And look the fact is, we think that in the end results, the domestic market is going to continue to decline. But we are absolutely prepared. If we get a period of time where we get a bit of a plateau, and it stabilizes, we're ready for that. But the fact is that the coal fleet does continue to age. Natural gas prices right now remain low. We're still seeing those systematic steady sort of coal plant closures each year, but there's still a significant market. So we are taking advantage of that. As Paul said, we certainly believe we can for the next five years plus, but in the end, we still think we prepared appropriately for right now, what you'd have to say is continuing declines over the next decade.Those are great observations. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow up, Paul, or for the group met coal prices here, High Vol A its risen quite nicely here the last several weeks, in the midst of maybe some steel production down or what have you. You get a sense for your customer base and how you're looking at your export shipments next year that is some reality to that. And there's reason for that, or is it a short term blip. Just is there a sense of maybe some better momentum because of the limited supply that we've seen, or is there the expectation that some more pig iron might come into the marketplace next year firing some of your -- some of the coals?Yeah, I'll let John follow up with the more direct contact with customers. But I think it's all of the above that you've mentioned. There is no question that the current market is under -- the supply is very tight. The underinvestment in the coal sector is really rearing its head. As I noticed my comments, hot steel production is down 1% this year, was down 10% last year, but at the same time, coal prices held up. 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago, this would have been, a big dip in coal prices. And I think there is also a little bit of hope on the macro side, but we're not counting on it. These are extremely good prices at current levels. 277 makes for a very good netback for us, particularly with our cost structure. And I think if the customer continuing to willow [ph] down our North American exposure, last year was at about 20%. It's looking like this year it's going to be about 15. And look, there's a lot of value to shipping coal in North America as far as logistics, but at the discounts that were being requested, and those that we understand were settled, we're quite happy with where we ended up. So Michael, I agree 100%, with Paul on one of the biggest drivers here is just the challenges you see across the supply, both near term, if you just look at it, so many of the announcements that we've seen here, even recently, and the challenges that the industry faces, quite frankly, around the world. And then longer term, in how that's going to continue to play out for something for steel, that clearly we've got our views that there's going to be comfortable demand for decades to come. So we feel real good about that, as we deal with our customers, I think the one thing I'll add, very proud of our marketing team and the efforts and success that they've had with our customers in the international market, especially new markets for us such as Asia, in getting the product there, getting the qualities of the product, realize the benefits. And that puts us in a position going forward that value and use of our product in those markets puts us into those blends, and then allows us to continue that as we continue to move forward as well. So we feel good with where things are going. And like I would -- it's Deck and look, I would add that, in mid July, we actually saw HVA prices drift down to $200 or so. At that level, you started to see rationalization, which certainly suggests that, given the marginal cost of production that there is support, at some level around that $200 mark. Now that's not perfect, and you can dip below that level for some period of time. But it certainly feels like there's support at that level. And then in fact, since that time obviously we've jumped a good bit and we're 277. Interestingly PLV, premium low vol out of Australia and off the Queensland Coast is more than $70 higher than that. So not to suggest that 277 isn't a great number. It is we don't need a higher number than that. But right now, what has typically been a $7 spread, between PLV and HVA, over the past seven years is a $70 spread. So you can see that there's still that sort of pressure on pricing, as Paul said. Supply sort of highly constrained, and we think there is the opportunity to minimum to close that differential. Now how that gets closed remains to be seen. And also just a reminder that look over the -- since 2010, the average price the seaborne market has been $238. So again, I think the world has changed a good bit, because of the supply constraints, the pressures we continue to see in the various jurisdictions around ESG and regulatory constraints. The under investment. So we're pretty constructive on the outlook sort of longer term. Well done, guys. Thank you. Thank you, Mike.[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Lucas Pipes of B. Riley. Please go ahead.Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on DTA. One of your peer at the terminal mentioned that there's a need for long range capital improvement projects. And I wondered if you could maybe speak to, one what sort of capital improvement projects may be necessary and what cost may be necessary. And then two, just kind of more broadly, how strategic is DTA to you? Would appreciate your perspective on that. Thank you.Lucas, I'll start out here. Just as reminder, DTA, we have a 35% ownership interest in that asset. It is a strategic asset for us. But it has more than sufficient capacity for us to meet our needs. Right now we're using about 3 million tons of that capacity. That leaves us probably with an excess of 2 million tons. DTA is an asset, like all assets that needs to have capital evaluation. We are working with DTA to evaluate those capital needs, where necessary, where economic, we'll make sure we're committing to that capital, where we've got unique opportunities with our excess capacity, kind of given where we see the market for that throughput. We can recover a lot of the additional capital that may be required as we go forward with the throughput capacity that goes through there. So DTA has been a great asset. It continues to be a great asset for us. We expect that it will move as we move forward. And I think we feel good in a lot of different ways we can manage the needs of that capital as we go forward.The other thing, I'd add to what John said is, it's a great relationship with our partner dock [ph]. We clearly have a little less pressure on us than them as far as throughput. And it's as we've given guidance, these capital projects that they're talking about are not a surprise. We've baked in our numbers, as we've talked about CapEx over the years. And we also think we may have the ability to offset a large degree of it with our excess capacity, and going up to a third party. So look, I think it's all well and good, but it's really not a surprise to us, and really not an issue to us,As we look at and look that the annual requirement for us, we expect to be relatively modest. And as John indicated, with that spare capacity to generate additional cash flows associated with third party throughput, really view it as very manageable. So it's a good asset. We want to continue to invest in it. We think it's going to be an important part of our overall logistics chain going forward. But again, highly manageable.And is your excess capacity their currently leased to a third party or is it just idle at the moment?Yeah, we just recently offered out some spare capacity, some of that capacity. We've been really husbanding that for the last few years, but have started that process and likely will continue to do so. We can expand on it meaningfully. But have just taken the first sort of step on that front and really focused on thermal throughput. To this point, there's been demand for it on the thermal side, which is a good fit for us. We'd rather move those volumes as thermal.That's helpful. Thank you. Then going back to your coking coal volume outlook, and the way I think about mine output typically is kind of on a normal distribution on a bell shaped curve or so. And I wouldn't expect you to provide a bell shaped curve here on a call. But I wondered if you could maybe speak to the range of outcomes for your four coking coal mines. Again, no need to be too scientific, but one standard deviation for mine, what does that look like? If you could just provide some ranges for your coking coal portfolio, I think that would be really helpful. Thank you.Yeah, Lucas, I mean I think, we may not get into one standard deviation discussion here, but I mean, just as a general kind of view we've got two powerhouse long haul operations, Leer and Leer South. Between the two of them, I think in broad scale, you would expect some high volume production, the opportunity of 8 million tons, right. You may have in certain periods where one mine is a little less, you may have other periods where another mine is a little more. And then as we've indicated, with our two continuous miner operations, Beckley and Mountain Laurel, they're each, kind of built to be around that million ton a year pace. We will always look to optimize the volumes, and quite frankly have had all kinds of success, in wringing out additional volumes across the portfolio through efficiency projects, what have you. But kind of in the most simplistic view, that's how I would kind of view it, that deck kind of gets you right around the 10 million tons there. And Lucas, as we think about guiding for next year, again, we're not there yet. We're going through the budget process. Leer has been in that 4 million ton per year range in coking coal. It isn't very thick coal next year. So there is potentially upside there. And again, we'll take that into consideration as we think about guidance. And as we provide guidance going forward that we feel very confident in. And Leer South is at that 3 million ton range, which is what we're kind of sort of indicating we expect in 2024. Both Beckley and Mountain Laurel have been more in the one, one range. So there's certainly upside. That idea of 9 million tons for next year. But we want to be careful and make sure that we're guiding to very conservative numbers, and under promise and over deliver as we go forward. But that's maybe gives you a little color.I appreciate that. Thank you. Then on the domestic side, North American medical contracts for 2020. The quality of that coal, how would you describe that? Was that [indiscernible], Beckley or Mountain Laurel? Or was that mostly [indiscernible]. Thank you very much?Yeah, Lucas, yeah, look, we were real pleased with the opportunity we had with the North American markets. And I would say that the products that we sold the 1.5 million tons does represent the full suite of our products. They are High Vol A, Low Vol -- High Vol B. Obviously the vast majority, or the majority of that I should say is High Vol A weighted. And likely for modeling purposes, you can use our typical splits that we have amongst the various volumes. But we're real pleased with where we got and the outcomes that we achieved. Equally excited about the volume that we have exposed to the export markets as we stepped into '24 as Paul indicated.Okay, thank you then. Last question for now for me. On the M&A side, how would you describe your level of interest? Are you looking? There are some assets out there that are for sale. There are public companies that trade at very attractive valuations. How do you think about M&A in this environment? Thank you.Lucas, I'll answer it probably the way we've answered it every time. We've looked at everything, and we will continue to look at anything out there, particularly anything that comes up. Anything that can bring lower costs and greater value, we're all ears. But at the same time we look at ourselves, particularly where we're currently at. Our best investment right now is in our own stock. And that's what our focus is. But I will assure you and I should -- and I would expect the shareholders would expect us to also, is that we'll look at everything and we'll question ourselves and try and figure out if it's the right move and we'll always hold it though against what our own option is against purchasing our own stock.Makes sense. All right. Well, I appreciate it. Paul continued best of luck.Thank you, Lucas.This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Paul Lang for closing remarks. I want to thank you again, for your interest in Arch. As I noted earlier, we remain sharply focused on delivering operational excellence. We're in the process of making significant progress with our metallurgical portfolio, and expect a nearly 20% increase in coking coal volumes in 2023 versus 2022. I think just as importantly we expect that momentum to continue with an anticipated step up in 2024, and yet another change in 2025. In short, we remain optimistic about Arch's long term outlook, as well as the company's potential to reward shareholders in a substantial way through our capital return program. With that operator, we will conclude the call and we look forward to reporting the group in February. Stay safe and healthy everyone.The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T13:20:26.000-04:00

"Still No Boom, No Bust","Back in July, I ran a post titled ""."" Things haven't changed much since then: inflation has come back down to earth, and the economy continues to grow, albeit slowly.Stocks are up aChart #1Chart #1 compares the level of the S&P 500 to the level of the Vix ""fear"" index. The two tend to move in opposite directions: rising fear levels result in lower stock prices, and vice versa. The Vix index is back down to pre-Covid levels, and stocks have been rising - though not yet to new highs.Chart #2Chart #2 shows Bloomberg's Financial Conditions Index, a reliable measure ofChart #3Chart #3 compares industrial production levels in the U.S. and the Eurozone. There has been very little progress in the level of industrial production since 2007, although the U.S. economy has been somewhat more dynamic than the Eurozone economy by this measure. Still, nobody's posting gangbuster numbers.Chart #4Chart #4 shows U.S. manufacturing production, a subset of overall industrial production. Here again we see very little improvement in recent decades. Ho-hum. But neither do we see any deterioration.Chart #5Chart #5 shows two measures of producer price inflation at the final demand level. This captures inflation at an earlier stage of the inflation pipeline than the CPI. By either measure, inflation has fallen to less than 2%.The Fed's done. The CPI won't be far behind, except for the fact that energy prices have spiked of late - through no fault of the Fed's. Biden's Green agenda is at work here, as well as fallout from the Ukraine-Russia war.Chart #6Chart #6 shows two broader measures of inflation at the wholesale level (as of August). Here again we see inflation back down to where it should be: 2% or less.Chart #7Chart #7 shows the 6-month annualized rate of change of the CPI compared to the CPI less shelter costs. As I and many others have been pointing out for the past several months, shelter costs have been artificially inflated as a result of the BLS using backward-looking statistics related to housing prices.Chart #8Chart #9The major component of shelter costs used in the CPI comes from what is called Owner's Equivalent Rent. As Chart #9 shows, OER is driven primarily by housing prices 18 months in the past.The chart shifts OER to the left by 18 months to correct for this. Here we see the peak in housing price inflation corresponding to the peak in OER. Since housing prices peaked over a year ago, OER is now beginning to decelerate.That deceleration is showing up very clearly in Chart #8, which looks at changes in the level of OER over 1- and 3-month annualized rates. What this means is the OER is going to be contributing meaningfully to lower rates of CPI inflation in coming months.The FOMC meets next week, and I see no reason for them to raise rates yet again. The big question is when they will begin to lower rates. Today, the market is betting on a 30% chance of another rate hike at the November meeting, with rate cuts not likely until mid-2024.It's important to note (again) that Fed tightening this time around is fundamentally different from tightening cycles in the past. The main difference this time is that the Fed is not draining reserves from the banking system. Reserves are still plentiful at over $3 trillion. That's a huge deal.Chart #2 makes the point another way: there is no shortage of liquidity in the financial markets, unlike during periods leading up to recessions in the past. The only thing that is ""disturbing"" the economy this time around is that short-term interest rates are relatively high.That doesn't necessarily pose a threat to the economy. It simply makes it more attractive for people to hold money - that is, higher rates increase the public's demand for money, and that in turn neutralizes the amount of ""excess"" M2 that is still circulating. See  from late August for a more detailed explanation. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",4,2023-09-15T22:55:00.000-04:00
"Nvidia Stock At A Make-Or-Break Level: Buy, Sell, Or Hold? (Technical Analysis)","Amid a rising interest rate environment,  () and its big tech peers have served as a very profitable hiding spotMajor U.S. equity indices (, ) have reconnected with key technical levels such as the 200-DMA [or are close to doing so], with the rapid run-up in long-duration treasury yields finally taking some wind out of big tech sails. However, I think the stock-bond dynamic has shifted or is shifting rightIn recent months, I have issued multiple warnings about unwarranted valuation premiums in the big tech arena (especially in leaders - Apple () and Microsoft () - ) and outlined the top-heavy nature of this market as a significant risk to major equity indices:A big chunk of this year's rally in tech has been attributed to breakthroughs in Generative AI (argued by bulls) or the hype around it (by bears). While we have seen tons of product announcements and releases from a variety of companies, monetization of Generative AI technology remains an unsolved mystery [outside of Nvidia, which is the ""picks & shovels"" provider of this AI race].After releasing their Q3 reports earlier this week, leading AI stocks such as Microsoft, Alphabet/Google (), and Meta Platforms () haven't fared all that well, with investors seemingly dejected by a clear lack of progress on the monetization of Gen AI products and services that are eating up billions of dollars in CAPEX investment.Now, as a ""picks & shovels"" provider riding the red-hot generative AI theme, Nvidia is likely to deliver another blowout quarter next month and Nvidia's AI GPU (and now CPU) chips are projected to sell like hotcakes for the next few years [despite the U.S. banning exports of advanced AI chips to China].If there's any real, proven beneficiary of the generative AI trend, it is Nvidia. And yet, Nvidia's stock has lost considerable ground in recent sessions, along with its big tech peers. From a fundamental perspective, I think Nvidia will continue to perform well in upcoming quarters since its major customers (cloud hyperscalers) remain committed to their aggressive CAPEX spending plans in the hunt for AI dominance.In  ""Nvidia: The Magnificent One Delivers On Its AI Promise,"" I shared the following stance on NVDA stock:Since then, Nvidia has dropped by nearly 20% or $100 per share, and it is now trading very close to our fair value estimate of $390 (shared in the note linked above). In light of NVDA's price decline, Nvidia's 5-year expected CAGR has moved up to ~20%, rendering the stock a ""Buy."" However, as I shared in my previous note -As of today, I stand by our model assumptions, fair value estimate, and projected returns. However, given the rapid run-up in long-duration bonds and heightened geopolitical risks, I see a greater possibility of a hard landing in the economy. And in that scenario, our generous FCF margin and sales growth assumptions can prove to be too aggressive. Before updating our model again, I would like to review the Q3 earnings report ( November 21st) and learn about the business' trajectory from Nvidia's management during the conference call.From a fundamental perspective, I see no material weakness in Nvidia for the foreseeable future given the positive read-through from cloud hyperscalers (Microsoft and Alphabet), Meta Platforms, and Tesla (). The valuation is subject to debate, and I am not entirely confident in our long-term growth and margin projections due to the elevated likelihood of the economy slipping into a recession at some point within the next 12 months. Hence, I would like to rely upon technical analysis in this particular case to help us make an informed investment decision.Back at $500 per share, I refused to chase NVDA stock despite mentioning that technically, the sky is the limit for Nvidia with no resistance at an all-time high. However, on the back of a ~20% decline, Nvidia Corporation stock is now in a technical correction and currently sits at a make-or-break level at ~$400 per share, with lots of air underneath this psychological level.On the weekly chart, Nvidia looks to be forming a rounding top. With RSI and MACD indicators rolling over, Nvidia breaking the $400 level could trigger a sharp selloff because there's little to no support on the chart. As you can see below, Nvidia went up from ~$250-300 to ~$400-500 in a straight line, and in technical analysis, we tend to see such vertical moves get re-traced.Zooming in using the daily chart, we can observe the formation of a bearish ""Head And Shoulders"" pattern in NVDA stock with the neckline at ~$400-410. While we haven't broken the neckline yet, NVDA is poking under this key trendline, and a breakdown here seems inevitable given the technical breakdowns we are seeing in other big tech stocks and major equity indices.If NVDA stock breaks the $400 level and we see follow-through selling in the next few sessions, I would view it as a confirmation of the ""H&S"" pattern. A bearish ""H&S"" pattern that  is already playing out, and I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia joined the bear parade here. While Nvidia could find some support at the 200-DMA level [$350], the measured target of the ""H&S"" pattern is $300, which also happens to be the technical gap fill level for Nvidia stock.In light of a -20% decline since my last update on Nvidia, the long-term risk/reward for NVDA stock has improved significantly, with the stock moving closer to my fair value estimate of $390 and the 5-year expected return rising to nearly 20%. As a picks & shovels play, Nvidia should continue to benefit from the ongoing AI CAPEX spending bonanza from other big tech companies. Hence, I think Nvidia's financial performance will continue to remain strong, at least in the near term.That said, the wild run-up in long-duration treasury yields has increased the likelihood of a hard landing, which could negatively impact the demand for Nvidia's AI chips. Also, the U.S. ban on the export of AI chips to China poses a fresh challenge for our long-term growth projections for Nvidia. Given our valuation model for Nvidia is quite generous, I still don't think we have a margin of safety to deploy fresh capital into Nvidia.Technically, Nvidia's stock is trading at a make-or-break level. A breakdown here could send the stock into a tailspin down by ~25% to $300 per share. Despite strong beats from its big tech peers for Q3, Nvidia and the ""Magnificent 7"" names are experiencing increased selling pressure in recent sessions, with major market indices breaching key technical levels.Looking at recent market action, I believe a ""flight-to-safety"" trade into long-duration treasury bonds [real safe haven] is seemingly underway, and a lot more money could come out of (previously high-flying) big tech stocks [perceived safe havens] in the next few weeks and months.Given the heightened macroeconomic, geopolitical, and technical headwinds, I cannot justify buying Nvidia at current levels. If we do see a breakdown of the $400 level (confirmation of the ""H&S"" pattern), then I think NVDA stock will slide down to $250-350 range in a jiffy.For bold investors willing to weather volatility, Nvidia Corporation stock could be a decent bet right here. However, considering the near-to-medium term risk/reward, I will be staying on the sidelines for now, but if NVDA gets down to $250-300, then count on me to be a buyer. I rate Nvidia ""Neutral/Hold"" in the low ~$400s.Thank you for reading, and happy investing!

Kura Sushi: Limited Margin Of Safety At Current Levels,"Roughly two years ago, I  (), noting that while the stock was doing an exceptional job growing its business, there was no way to justify paying for the stock at $80.00. This is because itIn fact, despite development/permitting delays, the company grewKura Sushi released its fiscal Q3 results in July and exceeding my expectations given the tough macro backdrop, reporting revenue of $49.4 million, a 30% increase year-over-year. Notably, this industry-leading growth was up against difficult comparisons (lapping 106% growth in the year-ago period), and was driven by comparable sales growth of 10.3%, made up of 3% traffic growth and 7.3% of price and mix. Meanwhile, June comp sales accelerated to an incredible 14.7% despite soft traffic industry-wide, benefiting from what the company called one of its best guest responses to date from a collaboration (We Bare Bears), giving it confidence in its ability to deliver on future collaborations (like DC Comics planned in August).Digging into the results a little closer, the company also shared that these collaborations have helped it to add new rewards members, and its new WaitList App that's been rolled across the system is providing more accurate wait times which could be a tailwind to traffic with less faulty times that may have otherwise shown significantly longer waits than usual. In addition, the company noted that it saw minimal check management, and it improved its balance sheet in the quarter (albeit with ~12% share dilution), by selling ~1.26 million shares at $54.00. These developments are positive, and the stronger balance sheet has given the company to flexibility to make any key hires needed to support its rapid growth, with Kura Sushi on track for another year of 25% growth in 2023 based on its guidance of 9-11 new restaurants (7 opened year-to-date, and 7 in construction currently with half to be opened in FY2024).Finally, from a margin standpoint, the company saw higher food costs with commodity inflation offsetting pricing, but gained leverage on labor costs with labor down 180 basis points to 29.2% as a percentage of sales with the benefit of menu pricing, the full benefit of robot servers and additional technology offset by higher wage rates. And one key take-away from the call was that the positive impact from a robot dishwasher (if implemented across its system) would be bigger than its past three initiatives combined (table-side payment, robot services, touch-panel ordering all estimated at 50-60 basis points of labor), suggesting that a robot dishwasher could lead to 70 basis points of labor savings. This is because dishwashers aren't eligible for tips so it's one of the highest paid back-of-house positions, and this would certainly be a nice boost to margins medium-term if rolled out to help offset sticky labor inflation and consistently rising wages in California.Overall, this solid quarter resulted in $5.1 million in adjusted EBITDA ($4.4 million when including stock-based compensation), with the $5.1 million figure up ~60% year-over-year. In addition, the company exited the quarter with over $70 million in cash, and while it has continued to grow at a rapid pace, it shared that it ultimately believes its long-term potential domestically could be over 300 restaurants vs. the 300 restaurant potential referenced previously. So, while this is one growth story that is sustaining incredible momentum while improving margins in an unprecedentedly tough environment (restaurant level margins up 100 basis points year-over-year), this is still the early innings for the story. And with the benefit of a better than expected promotion in fiscal Q4, it's possible the company could beat sales estimates of $55 million.As for industry-wide trends and recent developments, one area of improvement has been commodity inflation, which has cooled off after a very difficult 2022 (double-digit commodity inflation). In addition, applicant flow and retention appear to be improving (judging by commentary in Q2 2023 from many brands). This suggests less of a headwind from paying overtime and hiring/training costs than we saw following the ""Great Resignation"" post-COVID-19, which hit restaurants especially hard. It also suggests better guest satisfaction and productivity potentially, given that longer-tenured team members and those coming into jobs with higher experience (companies able to choose vs. take whatever is available) should perform better than those in training. However, wage inflation has remained sticky and most quick-service names in California will suffer with minimum wages set to rise ~20% to $20.00 next April.Fortunately, Kura Sushi is better positioned given its ability to lean into technology in what's already a unique concept with a revolving sushi bar. Second, the company doesn't appear to be seeing the same traffic hit as some of its peers, and it may have slightly less competition given that it's a more unique concept, meaning it could perform a little better in what's become a more promotional environment in casual dining. Finally, the traffic outperformance is a great sign and suggests Kura should be able to continue to take price in a measured fashion to help with margins vs. some Mom & Pop diners and other less iconic brands that may struggle to compete and take price when they need to find ways to reverse a trend of declining traffic. Therefore, while Kura may not be immune, its collaborations and execution to date is certainly noteworthy, and it has bucked the trend to date for negative traffic.All that being said, while traffic was weak in fiscal Q3 (March through May) for Kura, it has not improved in H2 according to data on seated diners and traffic industry-wide consistently decelerated following what was a strong July. Hence, although Kura may buck the trend again with its well-executed collaboration, it's not clear whether this will be the case in fiscal Q1 2024/fiscal Q2 2024 or if DC will perform as well. And while the stock may be down substantially from its highs, it's hard to argue that it's priced for any misses at current levels. Hence, while I see less risk in missing fiscal Q4, which will be reported next month, putting up similar beats in fiscal Q1/fiscal Q2 could be tough, especially with some price rolling off. Let's take a closer look at the valuation below.Based on ~11.2 million shares and a share price of $66.20, Kura trades at a market cap of ~$740 million and an enterprise value of ~$770 million. This makes it one of the smaller capitalization names in the restaurant space despite its incredible growth rates (25% unit growth last year), with a similar market to names like  (),  (), and  (). However, from a valuation standpoint, the stock trades at a significant premium to these peers, sitting at ~35x FY2024 EBITDA estimates of $22 million, giving it one of the highest multiples sector-wide, in line with that of high-growth franchised concepts like Wingstop () and over double the multiple of  (), another franchisor model generating significant free cash flow. And while I think a premium is justified given the considerable white space, industry-leading growth, solid execution, and room for further margin expansion, I don't see enough margin of safety here despite the sharp correction.Using what I believe to be a fair multiple of 28.0x EV/EBITDA to adjust for its incredible growth and even being generous and using FY2025 EBITDA estimates of ~$30 million, I see a fair value for the stock of ~$840 million or $74.30 per share to its 2-year price target. And while this fair value estimate points to a 13% upside to fair value, I am looking for a minimum 30% discount to fair value for non cyclical names trading at sub $1.0 billion valuations for starting new positions, and ideally 35%. So, even if we use the less conservative end of this range, KRUS' ideal buy zone comes in at $52.00 or lower. Hence, although the stock may be down substantially from its highs, it's hard to argue that it's cheap, and it remains extended above its long-term uptrend-line (current support at ~$50.00) with unfilled gaps below. Therefore, I see the reward/risk as balanced short-term, making it hard to justify chasing the stock above $67.00 ahead of earnings next month.Kura Sushi has massively outperformed the industry this year regarding traffic, and fiscal Q4 should benefit from what's been a highly successful collaboration with We Bare Bears that ran from June to July (first two quarters of fiscal Q3), followed by DC comics in August (free randomized DC x Kura Sushi Bikkura Pon prize for every 15 sushi plates). That said, this promotion will come up against a sharp turn lower in casual dining traffic, which also leaked into quick-service traffic, a negative divergence from what we've seen previously. Hence, while fiscal Q4 could beat estimates, it could be a tougher setup for fiscal H1 2024 (Sept. 2023 through Feb. 2024). And while this wouldn't be a big deal if Kura Sushi was sitting near multi-year support and offering a margin of safety, I think it's hard to argue for there being an adequate margin of safety here at over 35x forward EV/EBITDA.

Abercrombie & Fitch: Limited Margin Of Safety At Current Levels,"While it's been a massacre the past few months for the Retail Sector () with several large-cap names plunging over 50% from their highs, Abercrombie & Fitch () has been one of the few outperformers, andAbercrombie & Fitch (""Abercrombie"") released its Q2 results in late August, surprising the market with a double-digit beat on sales estimates, with revenue soaring to $935.4 million (16% year-over-year), its best Q2 performance in years. This prompted the company to raise its full-year outlook to 10% sales growth while also guiding its operating margin higher to 8-9% vs. a previous outlook of 5-6%. Not surprisingly, this massive beat with significant sales leverage and the benefit of lower freight costs helped the company to deliver strong earnings growth, with quarterly earnings per share soaring to $1.10 and FY2023 annual EPS estimates are now sitting at $4.40. Given this significant beat, the stock has tacked on another 15% gain since its results were reported, a massive divergence vs. the Retail Sector which has slid roughly 6% after an already brutal August.Digging into the results a little closer, Abercrombie noted that its strong margin performance was driven by average unit retail gains combined with lower freight costs, with operating margins of 9.6% in the period, just shy of its long-term 10% target. Meanwhile, its inventory was down 30% year-over-year, marking another impressive statistic, given that several retailers like Nike (), Foot Locker () have struggled to keep inventories down in the softer macro backdrop. And those that have shed inventory have done so at promotional prices with accelerated liquidation, like The Children's Place (). Finally, while ANF's consolidated sales performance was impressive with the Americas region leading with 19% growth, its performance at Abercrombie was even more impressive, up 26% year-over-year, while Hollister came in at 8% with the company noting that .Following the impressive results, Abercrombie's ambitious FY2025 targets outlined in last year's Investor Day targets are looking much more attainable, with FY2023 revenue set to come in north of $4.0 billion, just shy of the top end of its FY2025 goal of $4.3 billion. In fact, its long-term target of $5.0 billion is also looking much more achievable as well if the company can continue to fire on all cylinders and win some market share, and the company has made major strides from its low point last decade on , with it being awarded the designation of one of the best places to work in retail by Fortune in 2021. That said, the company does have its work cut out for it given the difficult macro backdrop even if it's making impressive headway on its long-term goals, with personal savings rates continuing to hang out near multi-year lows below 4.0% and set to dip lower with gas prices on the rise and mortgage/rent costs not getting any cheaper.Given the difficult macro backdrop; a mediocre start to the Q3 reporting season from Nike; plus warnings of some check management in sensitive industries like restaurants (in addition to traffic declines), I think it's tough to be overly optimistic about another beat in fiscal Q4, even if Abercrombie has trounced estimates to date. In addition, the company is in the unfavorable position of now having to lap difficult comparisons in FY2024 against what could be an even more challenging macro backdrop as credit card balances hit an all-time high of ~$107 billion in Q2 2023 in Canada and  in the United States, suggesting things are getting tighter for the average consumer. So, given this setup of difficult comparisons and a foggy outlook over the next year in regard to consumer demand, I think investors should demand a larger margin of safety, especially when the risk-free rate is the highest it's been in well over a decade.Unfortunately, as ANF's valuation shows, this isn't the case, with the stock up ~300% off its lows and no longer trading at a deep discount to fair value. In fact, the stock is now sitting at closer to full value even if it meets upgraded estimates and sentiment surrounding the stock is overly positive, which could lead to a sharp decline in the stock if it can't keep up its pace of regular beats each quarter which has buoyed the stock over the past several months. Let's take a look at the valuation and technical picture below:Based on ~52 million fully diluted shares and a share price of $55.00, Abercrombie trades at a market cap of ~$2.85 billion and an enterprise value of ~$3.40 billion, leaving it towering over other most other apparel companies like Boot Barn (), Buckle (), and The Children's Place which have massively underperformed ANF over the past year. However, ANF is hitting the point where its relative value has become much less compelling on a relative and absolute basis above $55.00. This is because the stock has now soared from a valuation of barely 7x forward free cash flow to over 16x free cash flow on an EV/FCF basis using FY2024 estimates, a valuation that offers minimal margin of safety for new investors, especially if the macro situation worsens, with this not priced into ANF in the slightest after its ~300% rally.Meanwhile, if we look at the stock from an earnings standpoint, ANF is now trading at ~12.4x FY2024 earnings estimates, and I would argue that a more conservative earnings multiple for the stock is 13.0x earnings in the current rate environment where we've seen significant multiple compression across nearly all sectors. If we assume FY2024 earnings estimates of $4.50, this points to a fair value for Abercrombie of $58.50, translating to just a 5% upside from current levels. And while this might interest some investors, I'm looking for a minimum 30% discount to fair value for mid-cap stocks and ideally closer to 35%, suggesting that the stock's low-risk buy zone is significantly lower at $38.00, providing a very margin of safety for new investors here.Obviously, I could be wrong, and ANF has certainly defied gravity this year, being one of the few retail names to charge to new 52-week and multi-year highs. However, the stock's rally looks to be getting long in the tooth here with the stock trying to make new highs this week and show follow-through above short-term resistance but immediately reversing on above-average weekly volume. So, with the stock extended short-term, beginning to show a minor change of character from a negative standpoint and being miles above its 250-week moving average at $25.00, I see far more attractive reward/risk bets elsewhere in the market today. One name that stands out is  (), which trades at just ~6.0x FY2025 free cash flow estimates with a ~5.6% dividend yield, making it a rare mix of growth and value as it brings as new high-grade gold mine online in Nunavut.Abercrombie & Fitch has enjoyed an incredible rally off its 2022 lows, trouncing the performance of its peer group and continuing to exceed most investors' expectations. Meanwhile, the company did a decent job of buying back additional shares during 2022, and is one of the few apparel retailers that has seen a significant increase in annual EPS vs. FY2019 levels. That said, I prefer to buy stocks when they're hated and trading near double-digit free cash flow yields and while ANF has executed near flawlessly over the past year; the stock is neither hated nor cheap here after its near parabolic rally. So, while the stock could certainly head higher, it would not surprise me to see some rotation into more beaten-up names with the easy money having been made already in ANF.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,"There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer. ThisWe've already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger & acquisition activity in the sector with  () and  () being acquired. There will be more similar opportunities in the future. For now, let's take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the U.S. energy sector.In the past 15 years, U.S. energy production has skyrocketed. Since 2007, we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter. We have increased naturalBut today – we don't hear much about this from politicians or in the media. It may be that, with today's political alignment, the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations – and, for other reasons, the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that fact.This article deals with the general effects of this development. Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topics:The table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022. Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time period.There has been a major decline in coal production, but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources. On a Quadrillion BTU basis, the decline in coal production has been roughly 11.458; while the increases in petroleum, natural gas, solar, and wind production have been respectively 13.969, 17.320, 3.504, and 1.814 for a total net increase of 25.149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly one-fourth of our total annual energy consumption. This has not been a demand-driven increase in production. During these same 15 years, the annual energy consumption in the U.S. has stayed roughly equal, actually declining slightly from 100.9 Quads to 100.3 Quads. There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables. But an equally important shift has been that the U.S. is no longer an energy importer and, in fact, exports petroleum (on a net basis), natural gas, and coal.Back in 2007, the massive U.S. oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which, in turn, was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices. Heading into the Panic of 2008, oil prices briefly reached $145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach $200 a barrel. When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day, $200 a barrel means more than $700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits. This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates, confidence in our economy, and economic growth.There is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy. Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of ""choke chain"" on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil, which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which, in turn, produced a recession. An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973, 1979, 1990, and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases. There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middle-income (and other) Americans who had to pay more money for gasoline.While the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them, the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental. Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lower-middle-income Americans especially hard. Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas, and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spend higher than average amounts of take-home pay on gasoline. The drain created by gasoline price increases may have increased the number of residents who defaulted on the mortgages that backed the securities whose failure led to the Panic.Now that we are no longer major importers of oil, it is still possible for world oil prices to increase and for that to increase U.S. gasoline prices. But there is an important difference. In 2007, the money being spent to buy more expensive imported oil was going overseas and, in some cases, was not easily recycled into the U.S. economy. If we had a major price increase today (as we had in 2022), the money would stay in the U.S. economy and go to higher royalty payments, higher tax collections in oil-producing states and localities, increased CAPEX by oil producers, and increased dividend payments to owners of U.S. oil companies. This immediate recycling of funds within the U.S. economy may have the effect of reducing the negative impact of higher oil prices on growth and reducing the danger of a deep recession. This may be a factor (although certainly not the only factor) in the surprising resilience of the U.S. economy in the current cycle.It should be noted that the U.S. economy can still be impacted by a cutoff in oil imports or a massive increase in the world oil price. While we are net exporters, the petroleum market is complex, and we still import crude and export refined products. Refineries are generally set up to refine certain types of crude, and transportation economics often leads to imports in one part of the country and exports in another part. Due to this complexity, an abrupt cessation of oil imports would be disruptive, and it would take time and expense to adjust. But the degree of disruption would pale in comparison with the impact we would have suffered in 2007.Now that the U.S. is actually a net exporter of energy rather than an importer, an increase in energy prices will tend to reduce the U.S. trade deficit rather than increase it. This would tend to strengthen the dollar. Most of our trading partners are actually net importers, so their currencies may be negatively impacted by higher oil prices. The net effect in the long term may be a stronger dollar which tends to reduce inflationary pressures.The fact that the dollar is not likely to be negatively affected by the rollercoaster of oil prices, although competing major currencies (the euro or the yuan) may suffer negative effects, is likely to cement the dollar in place as the global reserve currency.The fact that we are no longer dependent upon oil imports will likely enhance our national security. In the 20th century, oil was a major factor in the cause and the course of World War 2. Our oil independence may give us more leverage in confronting various oil-exporting countries (including Russia). The Strategic Petroleum Reserve – originally set up to ensure that our military would have access to oil in the event of a cutoff of imports – now does not really need to serve that purpose. Instead, it can be used to cushion the market from price fluctuations and also to generate profits simply by buying at low prices and selling at high prices. The Biden Administration seems to have adopted this policy.As noted above, the petroleum market is complex, and we should take measures to protect ourselves against the disruption that an abrupt cut-off would entail. It is also the case that many of our allies are net importers, and we would try to help cushion the impact upon them by increasing our exports if their imports were disrupted. But – again – the impact of an import disruption upon us from a national security perspective today would be sharply reduced from the impact we would have suffered in 2007.The above factors lead to certain conclusions from the perspective of investment. They definitely make investment in the U.S. more attractive than investment in markets which would be subject to severe impact from higher oil prices or an oil import disruption. The enhanced resilience of the dollar makes investment in dollar-denominated assets comparatively attractive.The U.S. energy sector also becomes more interesting because of its ability to serve as a source of exports to our allies; especially in the natural gas-oriented sector, certain names should command investor attention.

"Forget MPLX, 3 Reasons To Buy Enterprise Products Partners Instead","MPLX () and Enterprise Products Partners () are both investment grade, high yielding midstream businesses that have impressive track records of growing their distributions through good times and bad while also delivering very attractive long-term totalSince MPLX went public, it has delivered total returns that have totally crushed those of the broader midstream sector ():EPD has also significantly outperformed AMLP over the long term:That said, when comparing EPD with MPLX, EPD emerges as the clear winner in terms of which is the better risk-adjusted buy right now. Here are three reasons why:EPD beats MPLX in this category hands down, as evidenced by its sector-leading A- credit rating compared to MPLX's BBB credit rating. EPD's leverage ratio of 3.0x isAdditional metrics that support EPD's edge in this category are its robust $4 billion in liquidity, substantial free cash flow generation net of distributions, weighted average term to maturity on its debt of nearly 20 years, including over half of which is termed out to 30+ years.Meanwhile, while MPLX lacks the impressive debt maturity calendar that EPD has, it is still expected to generate between $1.2-$1.4 billion in free cash flow net of distributions annually through 2027 and sums to only ~$1 billion less than the amount of debt that MPLX has maturing over that period. As a result, it is well positioned to soften the blow to its interest expense that may come from having to refinance debt at higher interest rates.As a result, we can conclude that both businesses have strong balance sheets, but EPD's is still head and shoulders above MPLX's.Both businesses have strong and stable business models overall.MPLX manages midstream energy infrastructure assets across two main segments: (1) Logistics and Storage and (2) Gathering and Processing. Their operations include handling natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, and other hydrocarbons. They also transport products in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast and have terminals for refined petroleum. As a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (), MPLX is uniquely positioned near Marathon refineries, often serving as their exclusive provider. This strategic location poses barriers for competitors. Furthermore, MPLX's long-term contracts with Marathon ensure stable cash flow, making it resilient in the face of broader industry and macroeconomic fluctuations.EPD's top-tier portfolio is diversified by asset, energy type, and geography, with four key business segments: (1) NGLs, (2) Crude Oil, (3) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (4) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Its integrated business model and strategically located assets offer significant competitive advantages, presenting numerous opportunities for high-return investments and synergistic acquisitions.EPD's asset portfolio is overall better than MPLX's in our view as it has connections to every major U.S. shale basin and owns strategically located export facilities out of the Gulf Coast. Moreover, its comprehensive NGL network offers unparalleled access to Mont Belvieu. While MPLX's portfolio is also pretty good - especially its refining and Appalachia-based gathering and processing assets - it still lacks the strategic depth and breadth that EPD has.Moreover, its larger scale and geographic and asset diversity give it access to more high returning, low risk growth investment opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions. EPD's diversified operational footprint spanning natural gas liquids, crude oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals offers a balanced and resilient earnings profile. In contrast, MPLX is more concentrated geographically, has greater tenant concentration risk, and lacks the petrochemical exposure that EPD enjoys. As a result, we see EPD as having a more promising long-term growth profile compared to MPLX.Another big reason to favor EPD over MPLX is that EPD's insiders own a significant ~32% of the company's equity. This substantial stake not only underscores the management's belief in the company's long-term prospects, but also ensures that their interests are aligned with those of the shareholders.Meanwhile, MPLX is largely beholden to MPC, which owns a large percentage of their equity and is also their primary business counterparty. While MPLX benefits from the steady stream of business and operational synergies from its relationship with MPC, it also exposes MPLX to the operational and financial risks associated with MPC. Any adverse event affecting MPC could have an outsized effect on MPLX. In contrast, EPD's diversified client base and operations insulate it from such concentrated risks. Moreover, in the past MPC has sold mediocre assets to MPLX at a price that proved to be a bit rich via the Andeavor Logistics . There is always the chance that MPC could execute a similar transaction in the future, which would likely hurt MPLX unitholder value.A final reason why we like EPD more than MPLX right now is that its valuation looks much more appealing. MPLX currently trades at an EV/EBITDA of 9.35x whereas EPD trades at a nearly identical EV/EBITDA of 9.47x. However, when compared to their 10-year averages, EPD's valuation is at a more significant discount (12.23x 10-year average EV/EBITDA for EPD compared to an 11.64x 10-year average EV/EBITDA for MPLX). Moreover, on a five-year basis, MPLX's EV/EBITDA currently stands at a slight premium (9.25x five-year average EV/EBITDA for MPLX), whereas EPD's stands at a discount (9.91x five-year average EV/EBITDA for EPD).When factoring in EPD's stronger balance sheet, overall superior business model, greater insider alignment and less questionable ownership structure given MPLX's close relationship and dependence on MPC, EPD appears to be a much more compelling risk-adjusted buy right now.MPLX is not a bad investment opportunity either, as its 9.3% next twelve month distribution yield - that is well-covered by distributable cash flow - complements its fairly strong business model and balance sheet to make it an attractive income investment. However, EPD's very low risk balance sheet, strong business model, and even more compelling valuation make it the clear winner in the comparison of these two businesses in our view.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Mr. Guidry, please go ahead.Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining Gran Tierra’s secondOn Tuesday, August 1, 2023, we issued two press releases thatI’ll now turn the call over to Ryan.Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. During the first half of 2023, Gran Tierra completed its development campaign with the drilling of 21 development wells in three of our major fields, which have been producing oil at rates in line or exceeding our expectations. Gran Tierra achieved another strong quarter by delivering $53 million of funds flow while incurring $66 million in capital expenditures, which were both broadly the same as the first quarter of this year.Adjusted EBITDA was $85 million compared to $89 million in the prior quarter. Both funds flow and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by $13 million in realized foreign exchange loss during the quarter, which was caused by a strengthening the Colombian peso versus the U.S. dollar.With the development campaign now complete, we expect capital expenditures to be lower for the second half of the year while benefiting from the increased production from our new producing wells. Looking ahead, we’re entering an exciting phase of growth where we’re gearing up the drill exploration wells in Ecuador in the fourth quarter of 2023 building on our successful 2022 exploration campaign.As of June 30, 2023, the company had a cash balance of $69 million and net debt of $503 million. With a forecasted free cash flow in the second half of 2023, we expect to exit 2023 with over $150 million of cash. Looking to pricing during the quarter, the Brent oil price averaged $77.73 per barrel, which was down 31% from one year ago and down 5% from the prior quarter.The company’s quality and transportation discount narrowed to $14.10 per barrel down from $18.45 per barrel in the prior quarter. The Castilla and Vasconia oil differentials have continued to narrow throughout 2023. During the second quarter, the Vasconia differential narrowed to $5.53 per barrel down from $7.87 per barrel in the prior quarter while the Castilla oil differential narrowed to $9.41 per barrel down from $15.17 per barrel over the same time period. In July 2023, we have continued to see differentials narrowing with the Vasconia differential down to $3.96 per barrel and the Castilla differential down to $6.64 per barrel.Gran Tierra’s average production for second quarter was 33,719 barrels per day, up 10% from one year ago, an increase of 7% compared to the prior quarter. The company’s second quarter-to-date 2023 average production has been approximately 35,300. The company’s operating net back was $34.58 per barrel down 42% from one year ago and down 2% from the prior quarter.The drop in operating net back over the last year was largely driven by the decrease in oil price and the higher differentials over the time period. With the strong current production base, Brent Oil price above $80 per barrel, narrow differentials and the majority of capital expenditures in behind us, we’re very excited about the second half of the year. We’re also pleased to announce, we plan to invest again in the protection and conservation of the Andean-Amazon rainforest in the Putumayo Basin of Colombia by extending our support to the NaturAmazonas project.During the first six years of the project, Gran Tierra’s initial investment of $13 million has already produced impactful results that have benefited the environment and local communities, including the reforestation and restoration of over 1,400 hectares of land and the planting of over 1.2 million trees. We look forward to our continued partnership with the NGO Conservation International and are excited to build upon the positive impacts we’ve already made with that NaturAmazonas project.I’ll now turn the call over to Rob to discuss our mid-year 2023 reserve update and operational highlights from our second quarter results.Good morning, everyone. During second quarter 2023, Acordionero’s production averaged approximately 18,000 barrels of oil per day. Another strong quarter performance due to the successful 2023 drilling program and the ongoing prudent management of the enhanced oil recovery water flood scheme.As Ryan had indicated, the company has completed its 2023 development campaign. During the first half of 2023, the company drilled a total of 21 wells. In Acordionero 10 wells were drilled, six are on production, four are on water injection. In the Chaza Block, Gran Tierra has completed its drilling campaign Costayaco, which consists of seven wells, four of which are producers, and three of which are water injectors.Moqueta, we drilled for production wells. A particular note, the Costayaco 54 well was drilled and is the most northern well drilled in the Costayaco field, and excess of the well has resolved it in the identification of multiple additional drilling opportunities to target [indiscernible] regions of oil.With our 2023 development campaign now complete, the company’s pleased to provide a mid-year reserves update. The positive results announced in the reserves update are a testament to Gran Tierra’s operational success and are in-country relationships that have allowed the company to secure Suroriente license continuation. We invite you to read the reserve’s update press release in its entirety on our website.As of June 30, 2023, Gran Tierra now has the highest reserves in the company’s history, 94 million barrels oil equivalent or boe on a 1P basis, 150 million boe on a 2P basis and 212 million boe on a 3P basis.In the first six months of 2023, the company added 16 million boe of 1P, 26 million boe of 2P and 35 million boe of 3P reserves, which allowed us to achieve reserve replacement ratios of 270% on a 1P basis, 433% on a 2P basis, and 599% on a 3P basis. Despite a decrease in the brand price forecast used in the mid-year 2023, McDaniel Reserves Report relative to the 2022 year end McDaniel Reserves Report for the first 2.5 years of the evaluation. The combination of our successful development drilling campaign, the Suroriente contract continuation, our focus on maintaining low operating costs and our share buyback program allowed Gran Tierra to achieve increases relative to 2022 year end in net asset values before tax.Our 1P net asset value before tax is now $49.54 per share, up 7% and our 2P NAV before tax is now $84.39 per share, up 15%. Cost associated with finding and developing these reserves, excluding changes in future development costs and on a per boe basis came in at $8.55 for 1P, $5.33 for 2P and $3.86 for 3P. These mid-year reserve results are a testament to Gran Tierra’s ability to operate as a full cycle exploration production company, which offers value to our stakeholders via the success we have achieved through the drill bit.I’ll now turn the call back to the operator and we will be happy to answer any questions. Operator, please go ahead.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexandra Symeonidi with William Blair & Company, United Kingdom. Your line is open.Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have three if I may. I’ll go ahead and ask one by one. I’m seeing higher taxes this quarter. I guess this is because of the last tax payment for the fiscal 2022. Can you please provide some guidance for cash taxes for the second half of the year? This is my first question. Thank you.Thinking was the question, higher…Debt.Yes, it was really net debt decreased or increased…For the taxes, sorry, so my question was about taxes. Yes, so guidance for cash taxes for the second half.Yes, the only taxes that we pay in the second half are the withholding tax, which the reason the Colombia government has increased withholding tax and that’s really just a prepayment for the following year taxes, and that’s works out to about 8% of revenue.Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Very clear. Then the operating expenses at $15.86, we’re running a bit above guidance. Do you expect the second half to converge because you have been saying about higher production in the second half, right?Yes. We expect the operating cost per barrel to trend down throughout the year just with the – we look at our average for the quarter is around 33.7 in Q2. We’re right about 35,000 right now, so that will help. And then we did – we are a little bit higher than we forecast originally, and that was just with the strength of the peso.Okay.But as our production increases, we do expect our per unit cost to decrease.Okay, great. Thank you. And my last question is about CapEx. So given that the trading campaign has finished for the year, do you expect CapEx to come at the lower end of the guidance for this year?Yes. Our original guidance was $210 million to $250 million for the year.Yes.And think in our last release, we were lowered that to $210 million to $230 million. So we narrowed the range. So we do expect at the lower end of the range.Okay. Thank you.Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anne Milne with Bank of America. Your line is open.Thank you. Congratulations on the results. Two questions I have. One is I noticed that you currently do not have any hedges in place. So I just wonder at under what conditions or at what prices would you consider reinstating some hedges? And the second, I think you hinted that a little bit in the last answer – question and answer, which was the stronger peso. How has that affected your – I guess to what degree your cost basis and is there anything you can do about that to mitigate it?Yes, on the hedging, we go through an annual process of looking at all of our assets over a five-year period. We’re just starting that process. And you’re correct, we are unhedged at the moment. So we’ll evaluate that in the third – in the fourth quarter here depending on what we allocate for capital for 2024 and make those decisions depending on the capital program, but also what our outlooks are. And we’ll let Ryan answer the question on the peso.Yes, the peso obviously started the year, anger [ph] around 4,000 ran up all the way to 5,000. Now we’re back down to around 4,000. So it is putting a little bit of cost pressure on. We hadn’t done our budget at 5,000. We’ve done around 4,200. So it’s not significantly higher than what we had budgeted. But still is a negative impact, especially 75% of our operating costs are in pesos. Inflation has changed a little bit in Colombia. So that’s offsetting some of the inflationary pressures. So it won’t have a material impact on our results. This quarter we did it is predominantly because our payment of taxes in the second quarter, both in the April and June, and that was really the payment of our 2022 taxes, and that’s why you’ll see in our results we booked a large realized gain and that was just the change in peso. So it was truly a realized gain because we did make that payment this quarter.Okay. Thank you very much.Thanks, Anne.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roman Rossi with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Excellent additions on the reserve side. So I have a couple, I will go one by one. The first one you mentioned that the NCIB was completed. I was wondering if you are expecting to renew it or if you are expecting to just off hold cash in order to decrease the leverage ratio?On that question, we did maximum the NCIB and we can renew it sometime this month and then we would look to renew it even we do renew, we have lots of flexibility on whether we purchase shares on it or not. Last year we did repurchase 10% of our shares, but we would look to renew it.Okay. Awesome. And then adding to the CapEx question we had before, you need to spend around $83 million during the second half of the year to reach like mid-point guidance. But you mentioned that the exploration campaign will only begin in fourth quarter, so we should expect a light CapEx in third quarter and higher CapEx in the fourth?Correct. Yes. In Q4 will probably be driven by the exploration wells as well as building pads getting ready for the 2024 development campaign – development and exploration campaign.Perfect. Thanks. And the last question is regarding the Castilla and Vasconia differentials, we’ve seen that they have narrowed significantly. So what are we expecting for the second half of the year?Yes. I think we budgeted the number that we’re forecasting is higher than what they currently have, I think – but I think Castilla is close to $6 today. So it is narrowed quite a bit and Vasconia is below $4. We’re forecasting around $7.50 for Castilla and around $4 for Vasconia for the second half, but the market is tighter than that right now.Okay. Great. Thank you, Ryan.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josef Schachter with Schachter Energy Research. Your line is now open.Good morning, guys. And two questions. The first one for Ryan, you mentioned that net debt was $503 million and you expected cash by year-end to be $150 million, so up $82 million from where you are at June 30. You’ve also in the first half did some buying of the 6.25% Senior Notes Feb 2025. Do you see using that money for buying back more bonds? Or do you really have a strong need to want to see $150 million in cash on the balance sheet at year-end? Or are there other purposes that you might find to use that for?Yes. Its a good question. I think it is – we target to maintain a cash balance $75 million to $100 million, and that will vary by quarter and depending on activity. So we’re comfortable with the $75 million to $100 million cash balance. So we would look at where to deploy the – what’s called the excess cash in the second half, and that could be a combination of bond repurchases, share repurchases or just having a little extra cash to gear up for a more active 2024 program.Okay. Where do you see the comfort zone on net debt given your production levels and let’s say in an $80 print number? Do you want to see that number at 400 and then you’re happy and you can leave it there? Where do you see the targeted debt number you want to have going forward in 2024?Yes. I think we’d like to get our gross debt down to 500 and our net debt around 400 to 425. We think that’s a reasonable number, especially with our production base, the low capital requirements of our assets. We think that’s a very manageable number.Okay. Super. Yes, that’s – I agree with that. Question for Gary, in past presentations you’ve mentioned that you were looking at diversifying into maybe MENA other places around the world. Has there been much progress on that and do you see 2024 maybe adding another leg to the stool of the business?Ye. The answer is yes. We continue looking at diversifying value-add acquisitions and it’s a continuous process and we’ll continue into 2024. So we see lots of things that are out there that, that could add value. We’re sitting at a – trading at a half of our PDP and you can see the transactions that are happening globally. There are not many transactions outside of Canada and North America in general. But we – I think the answer to your question is we will continue our process of looking for value-add.And MENA is the main locate – main area or are there other areas as well?Yes. We always looking in the basins that we’re in and the countries that we’re in Columbia, Ecuador, but the targets for diversifying beyond those countries is definitely MENA.Right. Okay. So just to clarify what you’ve said before, thanks very much Gary and good luck for Q3. Looking forward to seeing the results given the stronger commodity prices.Thanks, Josef.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oriana Covault with Balanz. Your line is now open.Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two questions. If we go may – we may go one by one that would be great. First on the operating side, we noticed a 9% sequential decrease in Acordionero volumes. So just wondering if you could provide more insight into how are you seeing production growing across Ecuador and Putumayo? And if you have any color that you could share in terms of what drove the Acordionero lower production on a quarter-over-quarter basis, sorry.Yes. I think part of that was just timing on when we brought on wells. So we did probably – we had some flush production in the first quarter and then decreased in the second quarter. We also had some wells down during the quarter, which we subsequently have brought on, and that’s where we see our production around that 35,000 barrels right now.Perfect. And just going back to the CapEx question, I just wanted to confirm whether the expiration program through the remainder of the year. Will only be concentrated in Ecuador just looking at the 2023 guidance and the plan of going into four to six wells between Columbia and Ecuador, just wanted to confirm if we should expect to see anything coming from Columbia as part of the Suroriente continuation program.Yes. The answer is, yes. We’re focused on Ecuador. We’ve had some really good success. We’ve drilled two wells, two discoveries, and we’re looking for critical mass in Ecuador on the development side. We do have some very exciting things to drill in Columbia, but that will likely occur in our 2024 capital program.Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garrett Fellows with J.H. Lane Partners. Your line is now open.Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Could we just talk about plans to address the 2025 maturity and would you guys perhaps use some of that excess cash to reduce the overall quantum of debt?Yes. It is a good question. Our base plan is that we repay them as we come due and that as you, right, we point out is that we was some excess cash and we will look at deploying capital to the 2025s and targeting maturities.Okay. Thanks very much.Thank you. Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.Thank you, operator, I’d like to once again, thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter and update you on ongoing progress. Thank you very much.This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",16,2023-08-02T15:40:25.000-04:00
Sitio Royalties: Dividend Should Be Higher During Remainder Of 2023," () had its variable dividend reduced to $0.40 per share , but looks capable of offering a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend during the rest of 2023 based on strip prices.It also madeI now value Sitio at $27 per share, slightly lower than what I  for it before. This reduction is due to Sitio's production (excluding its recent acquisitions) trending about 3% lower than previously expected. that it closed on five mineral and royalty acquisitions between the beginning of April 2023 and August 7, 2023. These acquisitions had a combined purchase price of $247.9 million, consisting of approximately $181 million in cash and 2.5 million shares.Sitio added 13,862 net royalty acres (99% Permian Basin) with 1,918 BOEPD (approximately 52% oil) in Q2 2023 production. Due to the closing dates of the deals, only 137 BOEPD of that production was reported in Sitio's Q2 2023 results. Sitio is also adding 3.7 net line-of-sight wells from the acquisitions.Sitio mentioned that the acquisitions should be able to generate over $35 million in the next twelve months EBITDA at strip prices, translating into a less than 7.0x multiple.Sitio's incremental interest costs from its additional borrowings starts out at around $15 million to $16 million per year. 34,681 BOEPD (50% oil) in Q2 2023 production. This would have been 34,544 BOEPD without any acquisitions during the quarter, resulting in Sitio's 1H 2023 production averaging approximately 34,500 BOEPD.Sitio has also provided production guidance of 35,000 BOEPD to 37,000 BOEPD (50% oil) for 2H 2023. This is slightly disappointing given that its recent acquisitions would have closed early in Q3 2023 or before the half. Without the acquisitions, Sitio's 2H 2023 production (at guidance midpoint) would likely be approximately 34,300 to 34,400 BOEPD. This is close to flat production growth compared to 1H 2023 and also leads to full-year 2023 production (without the acquisitions) that is around 3% lower than the 35,500 BOEPD midpoint of its original guidance.At 36,000 BOEPD in average production during 2H 2023, Sitio is projected to generate $314 million in oil and gas revenues at current strip. Sitio's hedges add another $10 million in value, while I've assumed that lease bonuses and other revenues end up at around $7 million during this period.This results in a projection that Sitio can generate $234 million in free cash flow during the second half of 2023. Sitio's interest costs are substantial as it has over $1 billion in debt with a weighted average interest rate nearing 10%.Sitio currently has 157.2 million outstanding shares, so it could generate $1.49 per share in free cash flow during the second half of the year.At a 65% payout ratio, Sitio's quarterly dividend would average approximately $0.48 per share during the second half of 2023, while it would also have $83 million to put towards debt reduction.I've assumed that Sitio can average 36,500 BOEPD (50% oil) in production during 2024. This would be 0% to 1% production growth compared to 2H 2023 if its acquisitions had closed by the start of July 2023.Sitio could then generate $648 million in revenues at current 2024 strip, inclusive of hedges.While Sitio's cash taxes were relatively minimal in 2H 2023, I've assumed that its cash tax rate gets bumped up to around 11% to 13% in 2024, similar to its original guidance for 2023.Sitio's cash interest is projected to be around $90 million in 2024 if SOFR doesn't change much from current levels.This results in an estimate that Sitio could generate $450 million in free cash flow in 2024, or $2.86 per share.At a 65% payout ratio, this would result in a quarterly dividend of $0.465 per share and $158 million in debt paydown during the year.Sitio would end 2024 with around $815 million in net debt if it doesn't make more acquisitions.I now estimate Sitio's value at approximately $27 per share with long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX gas. This is slightly lower than my previous $28 to $29 per share estimate due to Sitio's production (before acquisitions) trending lower than previous estimates.Sitio's acquisitions should modestly boost its near-term free cash flow per share, but it now also has over $1 billion in net debt and will ideally work on reducing its net debt over the next couple years.Sitio Royalties now expects around 36,000 BOEPD in production after making a number of Permian Basin acquisitions that will increase its total production by around 5% to 6%.At current strip prices, I estimate that Sitio can offer a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend during the rest of 2023, and a $0.465 per share quarterly dividend during 2024.Sitio's production (without acquisitions) is trending a bit lower than I previously expected though, so I've trimmed its estimated value to $27 per share.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

APA Corporation: Permian Upside And Undervalued Production,"APA Corporation (), the holding company for what many recognize as Apache Resources/Corp is an oil and gas exploration company with a market cap of $13 billion.The company is led by CEO John Christmann who has been the CEOThe company's history dates back to December 1954 in Minneapolis, Minnesota where it was founded. The three founder's last name initials interestingly created the three letters A-P-A, its ticker symbol. Throughout its history, itThe company is diversified geographically. Here are its areas of operations. Its American operations, like many companies are primarily focused in the Permian Basin.Their global operations are divided between production in the North Sea and Egypt. Currently, the company has what they believe is an exciting project that is located off the shore of Suriname which sits two countries to the east of Venezuela.As of 2023, the company produced 325 Mboe/day. Here's a look at its annual cash flows. Just by looking at its record of operating cash flows, one can see how the company has struggled to grow their cash flow from operations.I believe that the worst is behind the company and that their cash flows will begin to grow. However, I think the company still has an uphill road to climb, thanks to their balance sheet. Below, we will examine their production growth to understand how their cash flows have been affect by that.This slide shows how their capital expenditures are divided between their different areas of focus with most of their focus being in the United States.The company plans to return a portion of its free cash flows to shareholders going forward. Its current goal is to return at least 60 percent of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since 2021, the company has been able to execute on this goal.The company has suffered through 2021 with its oil production. For the first time in five years, the company began to see growth in production in 2022. Sometimes companies reach a point or size where it becomes difficult to grow production. It is only common sense that, all else being equal, we should want to invest in companies with production growth.Here I will try to make a rough prediction on where oil production is headed for the full-year 2023. On its Q2 presentation, the company claimed to be producing 399 thousand BOE per day of which roughly 50 percent is oil. That means they are producing 199 thousand barrels of oil per day. This is a rough estimate, but if we multiply 199 thousand times 365 days in a year, we calculate that they will be producing a total of roughly 72 million barrels of oil for the year. Given the oil production declines from previous years, this should be very welcome news to investors. I'm not going to make the same calculation for NGLs and Natural Gas but each of these should follow along with oil production.In their 2Q report, the company stated that most of the production growth is coming from strong results in Egypt and the Permian.The company's balance sheet has been on an interesting path. Again, we can see that there were some significant write-downs in 2020 which brought its balance sheet assets pretty much right in-line with its total liabilities. Given that oil prices have rebounded from 2020, the company's assets would likely be valued much higher than their balance sheet currently represents. That said, the company is focused on debt reduction while maintaining dividends and some occasional share buybacks.The company has quite a long and varied debt schedule. In the past year alone, they have begun to put a dent in some of their higher interest debt. They were able to do this through some asset sales over the past year to two years.Source: APA 2022 10KThe company has maintained its shares outstanding relatively level. The company did a restructuring in 2021 which changed its number of shares. I wasn't able to find the number of shares outstanding following the restructuring but in 2022, the company had 418 million shares outstanding according to its Form 10K.As I've already pointed out, the company entered into the Permian Basin back in the 1990s. Therefore, the company has an impressive amount of Permian Basin exposure. It is unclear what number of ""net acres"" they control in the Permian Basin. I was not able to locate that information. However, their website says that they have exposure to 3.5 million gross Permian acres. With this amount of Permian Acres, even if it is only gross acres, then the company is likely very well positioned in the play.Currently, the company has focused their capital in the Southern Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin portions of the Permian Basin. These are the more lucrative places to focus and is where companies that I'm more bullish on, like , are also focusing. Apache Corporation claims that their acreage is spread out throughout the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf and the Delaware Basin which entails most of the Permian Basin.I am rating Apache Corporation as a very cautious buy. This is one that has a lot of upside potential in my opinion that can potentially be derived from its large footprint in the Permian Basin and other South Texas plays such as the Eagle Ford.The company has a market capitalization of only $13 billion. I think its undervalued relative to their current oil and gas production combined with their acreage positions, but given their track record during the past decade, and since their management team has largely remained the same for the past decade, I would say this is one reason to proceed with caution. That said, in my opinion, there is no reason that a company with 3.5 million gross acres in the Permian Basin should only be valued at $13 billion. Unless those 3.5 million gross acres is really only like 500,000 net acres or less. However, I would be interested to know how many ""net"" acres this equates to if anyone is privy to that information.Given its large footprint in the Permian Basin, this doesn't take into consideration its other operations in Egypt and the North Sea. The company also appears to be very optimistic on its prospect off the coast of Suriname as well. But again, just given its large footprint in the Permian Basin, and its relatively low valuation, I believe Apache Corporation has upside potential.If you've read any of my articles in the recent past, then you may already know that my personal preference is Permian Resources () if you want to gain exposure to the Permian Basin. To me, this company checks all of the boxes, but if you want to step out and take a risk while getting some diversification, Apache Corporation could also be a big winner.The most glaring strike against Apache is just simply its poor operating record over the past decade from 2009 to 2021, when oil prices were not the greatest, but still remained in a range where many other companies grew production profitably.Again, I believe APA Corporation is a cautious buy.

Balchem Corporation (BCPC) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Balchem Corporation () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2023 11:00 AM ETMartin Bengtsson - CFOTed Harris - Chairman, President and CEOBob Labick - CJS SecuritiesAnthony Polak - Aegis CapitalKyle May - SidotiGreetings, and welcome to the Balchem Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Martin Bengtsson, CFO. Thank you, Martin. You may begin.Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call this morning to discuss the results of Balchem Corporation for the quarter ending September 30, 2023. My name is Martin Bengtsson, Chief Financial Officer; and hosting this call with me is Ted Harris, our Chairman, President and CEO. Following the advice of our counsel, auditors and the SEC, at this time, I would like to read our forward-looking statement.Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements will prove correct, and various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including risks and factors identified in Balchem's most recent Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's call and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in our earnings release for further details.I will now turn the call over to Ted Harris, our Chairman, President and CEO.Thanks, Martin. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call.This morning, we reported solid third quarter financial results with strong margins and higher profitability year-over-year despite softer sales volumes. Our revenues of $230 million were down 5.9% versus the prior year'sGross margin grew 11.9%, and we expanded our gross margin percentage by 530 basis points toOur third quarter net income of $29 million, an increase of 15.2% resulted in earnings per share of $0.90 on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, our third quarter non-GAAP net earnings of $34 million, an increase of 4.3% resulted in earnings per share of $1.04 on a non-GAAP basis. Cash flows from operations were $47 million for the third quarter of 2023 with record quarterly free cash flow of $38 million.Overall, another solid quarter for Balchem with performance that highlights the strength and resilience of our business model in a market environment that continues to be challenging. Before passing the call back to Martin to cover the financial results in more detail, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the broader market conditions within which we are operating today as well as update you on some of our key strategic initiatives.The global macroeconomic situation and the dynamics within our markets remain quite challenging. And while the destocking we experienced late last year and in the early part of this year is largely behind us, our customers are adjusting to changing consumer buying behavior as a result of inflationary pressures on consumer spending as well as the high level of uncertainty around the overall macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.While it is hard for us to predict the timing of when the broader markets will truly normalize and reset for continued growth, we do believe the underlying fundamentals of the market we serve will continue to allow for growth over time and that we are well positioned with our portfolio of products and solutions to deliver above-market growth over the long term.We are pleased to report that our strategic initiatives in the Human Nutrition & Health or HNH segment are progressing well. One area of focus is on increasing consumer awareness and driving market penetration through enhanced marketing and communication efforts. To begin, we have laid a strong marketing foundation to help build awareness and to make our ingredients more appealing to end consumers. This includes strengthening our brand positioning and modernizing and unifying our HNH portfolio's identity for brands such as Albion Minerals, VitaCholine, K2VITAL and OptiMSM. Our goal is to expand brand recognition, enhance our premium positioning and create consumer awareness campaigns that resonate with our target audience.Additionally, we have formed a new partnership with the American Nutrition Association, or ANA, to drive growth through increased consumer awareness. In 2024, ANA and Balchem will launch campaigns to educate consumers about the health benefits of choline an underappreciated nutrient. This partnership will involve creating evidence-based content to effectively communicate our shared goals. We believe that this collaboration with ANA, a nonprofit organization that promotes personalized nutrition will complement our existing marketing initiatives and help expand the market size of choline.Ensuring quality and transparency in the supplement market is another key priority for us. We have implemented initiatives such as TruQuality for K2VITAL and TRAACS for Albion Minerals to demonstrate our commitment to excellence. These programs involve partnering with selected customers, retailers and analytical labs to ensure that the supplement available in the market, meet the highest quality standards, either by identifying and removing counterfeited products from the market or via improving the quality of the current formulations to further enhance stability and consumer benefits. These efforts build trust in our product brands.Furthermore, we are focused on accelerating the cross-selling of our HNH portfolio. As the recent SupplySide West trade show in Las Vegas, we showcased innovative nutritional concepts that leverage our portfolio of minerals, nutrients and food ingredients. By combining these elements, we aim to create synergies across categories in supplements, food and beverages.For example, the combination of Albion chelated minerals and K2VITAL Delta offers manufacturers a competitive advantage by providing a patented and stable vitamin K2 formulation in the presence of minerals like magnesium, which is in high demand in the market. In addition to our marketing efforts, we continue to prioritize scientific research for our specialty nutrients.A recent study on OptiMSM, our premium organic sulfur compound known for its unmatched purity, safety and consistency demonstrated significant improvements in hair density and diameter. This study adds further support to the value proposition of Balchem's OptiMSM brand which is widely used in products promoting healthy aging, joint support and hair, skin and nail care.Within our Animal Nutrition & Health segment, we are proud to announce the publication of three new papers from a study conducted by Dr. Heather White's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. These papers add to the existing body of research that highlights the benefits of feeding ReaShure to transition dairy cows. Cows that are transitioning from their dry period through calving to the period where they're are producing milk by providing data showing that feeding ReaShure helps to not only enhance milk production, but also improve offspring health and growth.This research further strengthens the value proposition of Balchem's market-leading rumen protected choline, making it a recommended choice for all transition dairy cows regardless of their health status or production level. Overall, we are making significant progress on our strategic initiatives, and we remain committed to driving consumer awareness, expanding market penetration and delivering high-quality products in both the Human Nutrition & Health and Animal Nutrition & Health segments.In the quarter, we also continued to advance our sustainability efforts and make progress on our higher purpose of making the world a healthier place. As reported on previous calls, over the last several years we have achieved noteworthy year-over-year reductions in both our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. In the third quarter of this year, we are very proud to have successfully completed our first ever public disclosure to CDP Climate. This milestone in our sustainability journey underscores our commitment to transparency. We are preparing to report our Scope 3 emissions in 2024, alongside our Scope 1 and 2 emissions that we have been reporting for a number of years.Additionally, in the quarter, Balchem's Board of Directors was very pleased to elect two new Board members to the Board of Directors to replace two long-tenured Board members who retired from the Balchem Board after reaching our mandatory retirement age. Olivier Rigaud, Chief Executive Officer of Corbion N.V., a global food and biochemicals company based in the Netherlands; and Monica Vicente, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. a global agriculture role and fresh food produce company based in the United States were elected to the Board on September 6. Mr. Rigaud and Ms. Vicente each bring relevant market experience and expertise and strong global business acumen to the Board. We are excited to have them both on the Balchem Board and look forward to their contributions over the years to come.And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Martin to go through the financial results in more detail. Martin?Thank you, Ted.As Ted mentioned, overall the third quarter was another solid quarter for Balchem. The strong margin rate performance from gross margin, earnings from operations and adjusted EBITDA were encouraging to see and in line with our expectations that we will be able to restore our margin profile to more normalized levels following the margin contraction we saw during the highly inflationary period we experienced in the prior year.Our third quarter net sales of $230 million were 5.9% below prior year primarily driven by lower volumes as end market demand has continued to be volatile and we're yet to see a more broad-based recovery across our segments.Our third quarter gross margin dollars of $77 million were up $8 million or 11.9% compared to the prior year. Our gross margin percent was 33.3% of sales up 530 basis points compared to 28% in the prior year. The significant improvement in margin was primarily driven by favorable mix and lower manufacturing input costs.Consolidated operating expenses for the third quarter were $33 million as compared to $35 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to favorable adjustments to transaction costs, and lower integration-related expenses, offset partially by a restructuring-related impairment charge and higher compensation-related expenses.GAAP earnings from operations for the third quarter were $44 million, an increase of $10 million or 29.7% compared to the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, as detailed in our earnings release this morning, non-GAAP earnings from operations of $45 million were up 10.3% compared to the prior year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA of $60 million was $6 million or 11.4% above the third quarter of 2022, with an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of 26%. Interest expense for the third quarter was $7 million, an increase of $3 million compared to the prior year. This increase in interest expense is driven by the significantly higher interest rate environment.We continue to use our solid cash flows to pay down debt and reduced our debt by $25 million in the third quarter and ended the quarter with net debt of $304 million with an overall leverage ratio on a net debt basis of 1.3x. Our company's effective tax rates for the third quarter of 2023 and 2022 were 20.3% and 18.8%, respectively. And consolidated net income closed the quarter at $29 million up 15.2% from the prior year. This quarterly net income translated into diluted net earnings per share of $0.90, an increase of $0.12 compared to the prior year.Our third quarter adjusted net earnings were $34 million, an increase of 4.3% from the prior year, which translated to $1.04 per diluted share. Cash flows from operations were $47 million, an increase of $5 million or 11.8% and we were particularly pleased with delivering record free cash flow of $38 million in the quarter as we continue to translate our earnings into cash.As we look at the quarter from a segment perspective, for the third quarter, our Human Nutrition & Health segment generated sales of $144 million, an increase of 1.3% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher sales within the Minerals and Nutrients business, the incremental contribution of two months of the Bergstrom acquisition since we acquired it in late August of 2022, and a favorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by lower sales within food and beverage markets.Our Human Nutrition & Health segment delivered quarterly earnings from operations of $31 million, an increase of 51.9% compared to the prior year. This was driven by the aforementioned higher sales, favorable mix, lower manufacturing input costs and favorable adjustments to transaction costs, partially offset by restructuring-related impairment charge.Third quarter adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were $36 million, an increase of $7 million or 26.1%. We were very pleased with the overall performance of our Human Nutrition & Health segment in the third quarter. The destocking behind us within HNH, the overall demand picture seems to be normalizing.The acquisitions we made last year are contributing nicely. The Minerals & Nutrients business has returned to growth, and the food and beverage business appears to be stabilizing despite inflationary-driven shifts in consumer buying behaviors. While volatility and uncertainty remain, we're encouraged by the year-over-year top and bottom line growth in our Human Nutrition & Health segment, as well as the sequential improvement. Sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2023, sales for Balchem's Human Nutrition & Health segment were up 6.5%.Our Animal Nutrition & Health segment generated quarterly sales of $54 million, a decrease of 17.8% compared to the prior year, driven by lower sales in both the ruminant and monogastric species markets partially offset by a favorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Animal Nutrition & Health delivered earnings from operations of $5 million, a decrease of 36.9% from the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned lower sales, partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing input costs.Third quarter adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were $5 million, a decrease of 38.2%. Similar to what we discussed in our Q2 earnings call, our Animal Nutrition & Health segment is experiencing challenging market conditions particularly in Europe, but also increasingly in the North American dairy market. The European animal feed market continues to show market demand softness and also increased competition from low-cost Chinese products.Additionally, recent decreases in U.S. milk and milk protein prices have further challenged the U.S. dairy industry, impacting demand for our rumen-protected encapsulated nutrients in North America. We continue to believe that the animal protein markets provide significant growth opportunity for Balchem over the longer term, but they remain very challenging markets at moment.Looking forward, as input costs come down and the domestic Chinese market strengthens, we do expect to see our European monogastric business normalize, but this may take some time. Regarding our ruminant business, we anticipate that over the course of the remaining months of 2023 and the early part of 2024, dairy farm margins in the U.S. will improve as a result of the lower feed costs and higher milk prices and the overall U.S. dairy market conditions will improve, enabling a return to growth of our ruminant business in the near term.Our Specialty Products segment delivered quarterly sales of $30 million, an increase of 1.2% compared to the prior year due to higher sales in the plant nutrition business and a favorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by lower sales in the Performance Gases business. Specialty Products delivered earnings from operations of $9 million, an increase of 23% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and lower manufacturing input costs.Third quarter adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were $10 million, an increase of 21.1%. We were pleased with the performance of Specialty Products in the quarter as improved margins on modest sales growth delivered strong earnings growth. While volumes continued to be challenged in the quarter as a result of ongoing destocking in the medical device markets, as well as customers taking downtime to upgrade the emissions control systems in anticipation of updated environmental regulations, the overall market conditions further stabilized as the quarter progressed.We were very pleased with our ability to drive earnings growth within Specialty Products in this environment and we believe we are well positioned to benefit as volumes fully normalized. So overall, the third quarter was another solid quarter for Balchem with sales and earnings growth in two out of our three reporting segments in a challenging market environment.I'm now going to turn the call back over to Ted for some closing remarks.Thanks, Martin.We are pleased with the solid financial results reported earlier this morning with significant improvement in margin performance leading to record adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, particularly in light of the strength of the prior year's comparable quarter and the continued economic and geopolitical uncertainties we are facing in the marketplace. We continue to show an ability to deliver results in a variety of market conditions and we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook for our markets and for Balchem as a company.Now I'd like to hand the call back over to Martin to open up the call for questions. Martin?Thank you, Ted. This now concludes the formal portion of the conference. At this point, we will open up the conference call for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.Good morning. Congratulation on some solid performance. And thanks for taking our questions.Thank you, Bob.Thanks Bob.Yes, I wanted to start with ANH and kind of following up on Martin, the comments you just made there. Maybe if he could, break it down a little bit further. It sounds like, the European feed situation has kind of two headwinds between demand, there from the farmers. And then also competition from Chinese imports, and maybe give us a sense of how that's flowing. And then, overall talk about the level has dropped to 54 million you haven't seen since early 2021. How do you see kind of sales recovering? Going forward, but maybe just break down Europe, first, please?Yes, Bob, thanks for the question. I'll give it a shot. And Martin, you can chime in to add some color. But I do think it is worth noting just out of the gates that 2022 was quite a strong year for ANH. We grew revenues about 16% and profits up almost 30%. So we're coming off of a very strong year. But having said that, we're clearly experiencing some real challenges in ANH business.It's really starting with the European situation. And I guess to put it into context, our European monogastric business is about 20% of our ANH business. So it's on the smaller side of the geographies. But we are experiencing both lower demand driven I think, certainly in part by the economic situation in Europe, with high energy costs, high commodity costs.There's just the feed market generally speaking is down in Europe, and that's driving lower demand for us. And we do see that stabilizing and starting to come back a little bit. I think Q3 was a little bit better than then than Q2 from a volume perspective. And we expect Q4 to be a little bit better than then Q3. So, we do see as energy costs have come down, some commodity costs have come down, that volumes are starting to pick back up a little bit, which is - encouraging.But as you noted, the other part of the equation is the increased competition from imports from China. And that's being driven by certainly the low demand that is occurring in the Chinese marketplace and not enough demand to soak up their capacity. So it is moving offshore. And that's impacting us. And we, as we said, believe that, as demand picks up in Europe a little bit as the economy and China picks up as well, that we should see some easing of that situation in Europe.But again, it is a challenging environment. And it may take some time for that to fully recover, but we do feel like it's stabilizing where it is which at least is, the, first step that you need to see. The ruminant situation is quite different. I think there's a little bit of timing associated with this quarter versus the quarter last year that was particularly strong, as well as Q2 that was quite healthy.So, there's a timing element to Q3 of this year. But also milk prices have really come down significantly - protein prices as well in the U.S. market. And that's just having an impact overall on the market. But we see this as a much shorter period of kind of depressed demand. And that over the course of the next three to four months, we should see demand to pick back up somewhat as commodity costs decline in this country, farm margins improve, and the appetite to add supplements to feed increases.So, we do see the ruminant business in the U.S. turning around in the near term. We also are excited about several new innovations, one of which we should bring to market in the coming three to four months, that will give some tailwind to sales as well with a new product on the marketplace. So ruminant certainly as a shorter term issue that we're facing the European situation is a little bit longer term.And I guess it's also important to note, 50% of the business is the North American monogastric business, and that actually is performing quite well. That includes our companion animal business and our poultry and swine business. So two issues that we're focused on, European monogastric and the global ruminant business with global ruminant turning around, we believe, in the near term.Okay, super. Thank you so much for that color. And then just was obviously happy to hear you discuss more about raising awareness for choline and your other products. And maybe you could dig in a little bit more about the investment next year you plan on making with ANA. How does it impact the P&L? How do you measure success for it? What should we expect to see out there, if anything?Yes. We're really excited about the broad program of building awareness that we've been talking about a little bit, over the last few quarters on the calls. But working very hard behind the scenes. We have a great marketing team that is really helping us drive increased awareness and ultimately increased penetration in the marketplace. The ANA partnership is really only one part of that.But we really think that they are a high-quality nonprofit organization that can help us deliver sort of quality content to consumers maybe like we've struggled to do in the past and address that gap that we've had in our communication with consumers. But it comes more broadly than just the partnership with ANA. It's - we talked a little bit about something I'm very excited about is.These efforts on our part to identify products that aren't what they are represented to be in the marketplace. And we've had some very good success in working with our customers and retailers, and as well as other industry associations to identify these products in the marketplace as essentially counterfeit products, or not having mineral or vitamin or nutrient content that they tend to have.And we've been identifying those, bringing those to the attention to the retailers, having them taking off the marketplace. And what that does, is a couple of things for us, it certainly strengthens our value proposition of bringing high-quality trusted products to the marketplace. But also eliminate some of those products from the sales of those retailers and allows our product to shine more brightly, which has been encouraging.So overall, we're really pleased with this effort. Ultimately, we're going to see, from it higher sales. We're going to be able to talk about higher penetration rates. We ultimately should be able to see it in Nielsen data, around the consumer purchases of our products and those growth rates, and we should be able to report out on those kinds of numbers. In fact, over time, which really is what all of this is about, and what we're trying to drive.Okay. Super. Thanks for that color. I'll jump back in queue.Thanks so much. Bob.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Polak with Aegis Capital. Please, proceed with your question.Yes. I was wondering if you could go over the interest and other expense item, which significantly increased. Is that mostly for interest from this acquisition? Or is that other expenses also?Tony, this is Martin. It's really driven by the interest expense on the debt. So, if we think about the interest rate environment, we are essentially fully variable from an interest rate perspective. So, we pay a SOFR index rate plus a spread, and that has gone from where were we a year ago, maybe down at 2%, 2.5%, and now there's an effective rate of 6.5%.So it's really that change in the interest rate applied to our debt. Now we keep reducing our debt. So, we're down to $380 million or so of outstanding debt. So we continue to pay that down at a fairly rapid clip. But the increase in the interest rate has more than offset that, and that is really the change in the interest expense.And is there anything new on the autism drug scenario?Tony, there really is no new headline to talk about, and we certainly will address that proactively in future earnings calls as there are changes or things to update. But that doesn't mean to say that there hasn't been a whole lot of progress and work done behind the scenes. We have, as we have talked about in the past, moved our manufacturing to a new contract manufacturer.That's taken us well over a year to do, but that is now complete. We have completed all of the kind of engineering batches and stability batches that needed to be completed in order to file the BLA with FDA. And so from Balchem's perspective, we've been working very hard behind the scenes to get all of that done to both support the submission of the BLA as well as to ultimately support any market launch that there could be over the course of the next year or so.We do believe and what we're hearing from the team at CureMark is they are feverishly working on finalizing the BLA for submittal to FDA. And while there's only a couple of months left in the year, are - expectation was that, that would be filed this year. And then it would be in the hands of FDA. Obviously, this is completely out of our control and that could leak into next year.But we do know that they're working very hard. And we're on every other week calls with them to make sure there's nothing more that we can provide, and there isn't at this point in time and just, to see how things are going, and we know that they're working very hard on that. So that's encouraging.But nothing headline worthy that we would have talked about such as submittal of the BLA. When that happens, we'll certainly let everybody know. And of course, the biggest milestone being ultimate approval of the BLA. So that's where we are on that, Tony.Thank you. Okay.Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle May with Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning, everyone.Good morning, Kyle. And welcome to the team.Hi appreciate that. Looking forward to getting another story even better than I already do. But one thing - I really wanted to come back to, you had a really strong quarter from the Human Nutrition & Health segment. Ted, you talked about several strategic initiatives. And I was wondering if you could clarify if these initiatives already are starting to contribute to the growth that we saw in the third quarter or if this is something that is just going to further strengthen the business?I think that it is more something that will strengthen the business going forward. But there's no question we're seeing some of it now. I think that we can't give much credit to those initiatives for the strong human nutrition health quarter that we had. But there is some in there. And we are really seeing the value of our portfolio paying off.And what I mean by that is when our sales reps are visiting our key customers and maybe our legacy customers who are buying choline or maybe our chelated minerals that we added to the portfolio in 2016. They're also having opportunities to talk about MSM and K2 and K2 Delta. And opportunities are coming from that, and sales are coming from those opportunities.So part of the expectation of adding some of these products to our portfolio was synergy sales, and we are seeing some of those materialize. I think its early days, but we'll start to see that ramp up. And I think these broader marketing and science initiatives that we have will just further accelerate over time. We are really excited about the portfolio. Our whole team is out.Unfortunately, I can't be there, because of this call, but it's a supply side West in Las Vegas. And we're really spending this trade show, which is really the premier supplement trade show, and we're really focused on the synergies across our portfolio, and it's not just the minerals, nutrients and vitamins.But it's also the food and beverage system formulation expertise that we have and all the feedback from the team out there - it's gone really well. So, more to come on all of this. I think it's helping a little bit right now, but will contribute more as time passes.Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe a big picture question. I know you and Martin both kind of touched on some of the uncertainty in the market. But just wondering if you can maybe expand on that and give us a sense of kind of, what you're seeing now from a macro perspective, and how that translates as we look ahead to 2024?I think that we use the word uncertainty, because I think it is a good descriptor of what's going on. We went through this phase of destocking as we talked about late last year, the early part of this year, that really resulted from the very high demand during the pandemic that slowed, the supply chain issues that eased, resulting in most customers having excess inventory for normal demand levels.To now a period where I think those inventory levels have normalized, but there is kind of uncertainty around soft landing, hard landing, what will demand really look like in the coming three months, six months that's causing customers generally speaking, to keep, I think, lower levels of inventory, managing their cash and controlling what they can control now that they have assurance of their supply chains.They know they can get products within regular normal lead times. And so, there they're hunkering down a little bit, because of the uncertainty of the recessionary environment that we're in or nearing or that's right around the corner and of course, then the geopolitical uncertainties on top of that. That's really what we're talking about, that there just seems to be a heightened amount of uncertainty as to what future demand will look like.Having said that, in our Human Nutrition & Health business, we were really pleased to see that our minerals and nutrients business return to real year-over-year growth in the quarter. Our Nutrition business was up organically 4% or 5% in the quarter after having been organically down for a few quarters. So that business is stabilizing. Our food and beverage business was still down a little bit year-over-year, but less so than it was in Q2.And so, we'll see a sequential improvement in that. And so, we do see some stabilizing, if you will, going on in the still uncertain environment. And so, we were really encouraged by the performance of the Human Nutrition & Health business.Obviously, we have a couple of clear challenges that we're facing in the ANH business. But I think the Human Nutrition Health business shows signs of stability and kind of getting passed at least some of the uncertainties.Great. That's helpful and I appreciate the overview. One more question from me. Just as we think about the maybe the strategy or the environment for acquisitions. The last deal was completed in August of last year. Obviously, you can't tell us about anything that's going on behind the scenes. But just curious if you can give us a sense of maybe the landscape or the environment for M&A activity?We still remain active, at least internally from an M&A perspective. We feel like our leverage is conservative and at a healthy position. So, we can make additional acquisitions, but having said that, the market is relatively slow from an M&A perspective. The activity has not gotten back to a more normalized. We keep using that word, but even the M&A market, I would say, is not normal today and hasn't gotten back to a more normalized level.So there are fewer deals today than, we normally see, so that creates some barriers. And then, of course, with interest rates being high, that does change the math around valuations and so forth. So, we continue to have a healthy portfolio of opportunities, that we've identified that we continue to work, but it is a little bit of a slower environment. And I think that's going to the likely impact, the timing of the next acquisition that makes sense from a strategic and value perspective for Balchem.All right. Great. Appreciate the time this morning.Thanks so much, Kyle. Again welcome to the team.Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ted Harris for closing remarks.Thank you, Alicia. I would just like to thank everybody for your time today. We really appreciate your support as well as the time you spent on the call today. We look forward to reporting our Q4, 2023 results, seems like a long time away, but late February of next year. In the meantime, we will be participating at the Baird Global Industrial Conference in Chicago on November 7. And we certainly hope to see some of you there. So with that, we'll end the call, and thank you again for joining us today.Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",1,2023-10-27T14:32:04.000-04:00
Intrepid Potash: Stay Away As Market Conditions Worsen Significantly,"Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome The Sprinting Investor as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Intrepid Potash () has seemingly maintained momentum over the last couple of months looking at how it has been able to bounce off the moving average and signal a trend upwards. But the fact of the matter remains that the market conditions have significantly worsened as commodity prices have plunged. IPI has been unable to hedge against this and is looking like a risky investment, resulting in my sell rating. For the short term, this may be a bullish signal, but looking at how the company is performing every quarter, it seems that this move upwards will beIPI has had a tough time achieving a strong bottom line that keeps its ground so to speak. The company may have managed to get rid of a lot of the debt it had previously, but the worsened pricing environment for Potash is making it difficult for IPI to generate similar EPS results as in previous years it seems. This is cause for concern and devalues the rating of the business to a sell.IPI specializes in the production and distribution of potash and langbeinite products. These essential products cater to various sectors and have far-reaching applications, contributing significantly to the agricultural and industrial landscape. IPI operates through three key segments: Potash, Trio, and Oilfield Solutions. Each segment serves distinct purposes, collectively bolstering the company's diversified portfolio. The Potash segment focuses on delivering high-quality potash products, meeting the needs of agricultural and industrial clients alike. Meanwhile, the Trio segment caters to a broader spectrum of clients, offering essential nutrient solutions to enhance soil and crop health. The last segment focuses instead on the oil and gas industry as it helps supply brines for well workover and completion activities.The main business of IPI is the potash , where in the first half of 2022, for example, it made up around 54% of the total sales. That was the same year as the pricing environment seemed to have gone haywire and potash spot prices increased exponentially in a rather short period.Comparing that to the  and the result from the segment, we can see a clear difference on a year-over-year basis. The sales may be the same, or slightly less in Q2 FY2023, but what has made the biggest difference is the average potash price per ton, down from $738 to $479. Besides that, the potash production volumes for the company have also decreased heavily. Many companies are trying to drag down production to create a more favorable market environment to sell in. Less supply equals higher prices. A large company in the industry making potash is Nutrien () which is  trying to cut back on production levels to hedge against the worsened prices and the revised outlooks of earnings growth.Looking at the technicals, I think they remain quite bullish for the short term. The rock price has managed to maintain its position above the 50-day Moving Average, as seen in the red line above. This indicates to me that we are likely to trend higher in the short-term at least, but if the poor pricing conditions manage to persist, then it seems that the support won't be enough. We can see that before when the share price was trading below the moving average, it was the common case that it would drop significantly on some days. That is the volatility that investors will have to take on with the stock I think.Looking closer at the RSI for the company, it sits perhaps not in the buy zone just yet. If the share price starts to see increased momentum and the RSI reaches above 65, I would see that as a sell signal as it's significantly overbought. One has to consider the fundamentals of the business and not just the share price. At an RSI of 65, the downside risk is quite large. The pricing environment will be discussed further down, but it can be said that the poor growing season in the US has caused an oversupply of potash, which is suppressing the prices and limiting the earnings potential of IPI, I think. If a P/E in line with the sector is to be used, then IPI would have a share price of $2.66 given the future EPS estimates for 2024. That is a multiple of 14, in comparison to the nearly 130 the company is trading at right now. It showcases very well the potential downside risk associated with a correction in the price if the RSI reaches above 65.I think a fair comparison between IPI and another is NTR. Both of them are engaging in the production and distribution of potash and have had their earnings affected by the worsened pricing environment over the last 12 months. On the chart above though, it seems clear that NTR has fared far better as it's down 28% over the last 12 months, as opposed to the near 40% for IPI. Valuation-wise, it also looks far better at a FWD P/E of 12, compared to over 40 for IPI. This limits the downside risk from here in my opinion and creates a more favorable risk/reward profile for NTR. Margin-wise, NTR has also done a better job with the FCF, for example, which sits at a TTM positive of nearly , far above IPI and its negative . All in all, I would say that those who want exposure to the potash industry may want to consider NTR rather than IPI right now, from a sheer risk/reward perspective and also historical performance.Basing an investment thesis on previous results can be dangerous and I think the TTM numbers for IPI are skewing the reality of the share price right now. The TTM P/E is under 10, a 25% discount to the sector's median. But it quickly jumps up to 39 on a FWD basis instead. I think we are looking at an incredibly volatile company here that has earnings driven by market sentiment as it's exposed to several commodity prices.Assessing the actual value should be done with caution I think and that means a lower P/E, or certainly a lower one than it currently has. For the sake of it, I think that IPI can trade at a P/E of 20, as it has averaged the last 5 years. That still leaves a 50% drop from current levels to reach that though, and would set IPI up for a price target of $12.6. Now perhaps the potash prices increase the way they did in 2022 and IPI can generate EPS of $5.98 once again, which would with a 20x earnings multiple give IPI a target price of $119. That's a nearly 6x potential upside. Now, I don't think that potash prices will be increasing like that in the coming years. The war in Ukraine was the cause of the elevated prices, and betting on there being another event like that happening is not something I am willing to do. This means that I view the potash prices as perhaps increasing steadily over the long term, but not like what they did last year. Even an 8% CAGR would be impressive and quite high. Setting a price though on IPI, I think a reasonable target to look for is around $10 - $12. At that point, the risks would be baked in and the company would be trading at the historical levels it has been.For IPI, the main risks involve suppressed commodity prices for a prolonged period I think. The most challenging scenario entails an extended duration of persistently low fertilizer prices and consequent cash burn. Such a situation could compel the company to resort to taking on additional debt, potentially eroding its book value over time. It's important to note that fertilizer prices have been trending downwards, and historical data indicates that there's potential for further declines. With IPI also right now not having a larger debt position, the possibility of them adding more is certainly there in my opinion. This could weigh on the share price as the potential earnings of the future may need to be diverted to paying down debt instead. This would decrease the stockholder's equity in the business and likely yield a lower share price I think.The global  of potash experienced a significant increase, coinciding with a rather  application season in the United States this year. These dual factors exerted substantial downward pressure on potash prices. As production surged on a global scale, the demand-side dynamics in the U.S., particularly in the agriculture sector, didn't align favorably with the increased supply. The fact that the industry is producing more  than ever, and the poor growing season so far is creating an oversupply of the commodity. This only results in one thing, lower prices to try and get inventory out the door.Looking at the inventory turnover for the business, it seems that they have at least been trending upwards somewhat. A stronger inventory turnover is indicative of stronger sales. For the last couple of quarters though, it seems to be heading in the opposite direction. The TTM is 2.26, down from 2.41 in 2022. This points to a lack of activity in the market and is likely to yield IPI worse earnings results in the coming quarters.What I think could potentially make IPI a buy or at least a hold is commodity prices that it is expected to greatly increase in price and showcase strong support for staying at elevated levels. That could help yield even better earnings for the company and it may even look like decent value right now. But I remain skeptical on that front as the weather conditions and significant price improvements are necessary first and foremost.I think that IPI is in a very interesting market but it has also done a good job of diversifying itself to other industries as well, like oil and natural gas as it has some exposure there. The short-term seems decent as the share prices continue to rise above the moving average, but if the RSI continues trending upward towards 65, I fear that a significant correction may be in place. Then I am not talking about a drop of 10 - 15%, but more like 30 - 40% as IPI is already trading far above the rest of the sector on an earnings basis alone. The risk profile seems too large to ignore and is indicative of a 'Sell' for now.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

All forward-looking statementsIn addition, we will present certain non-GAAP measures, which should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results. ReconciliationsFor the Q&A session today, we'd ask that you observe a limit of one question and one follow-up.Now, I will turn the call over to Anirudh.Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the third quarter of 2023. We exceeded our Q3 guidance on all key metrics and are raising our outlook for 2023. John will provide more details on our financials shortly.Notwithstanding the macro uncertainties, design activity remains strong, driven by transformative generational trends such as AI, hyperscale computing, 5G and autonomous driving. Growing hyperconvergence between electrical and mechanical domains, systems and semis, and hardware and software, is driving the need for tightly integrated co-design and analysis solutions. Additionally, trends such as a growing number of 3D-IC and chiplet designs, and system companies building custom silicon, are accelerating.In this rapidly evolving design landscape, the relevance of AI-driven design automation cannot be overstated, as it's enabling customers to accelerate their pace of innovation, while enabling them to meet their targets more efficiently.Over the past few years, we focused initially on incorporating powerful AI algorithms in our core engines, and then built our Generative AI solutions on top of our software platforms. We are seeing growing momentum for our comprehensive JedAI Generative AI platform, with an increasing number of customers adopting these solutions, and achieving exceptional quality of results and productivity gains. While still in the early stages, sales of our GenAI solutions have nearly tripled in the last year.Our solutions are enabling marquee AI infrastructure platform companies to deliver their next-generation compute, networking, and memory products. Last quarter, we had referenced our successes with NVIDIA and Tesla. And this quarter, we're pleased to announce that Broadcom has accelerated the adoption of Cadence Cerebrus across multiple business units, achieving impressive quality of results.In Q3, we pioneered leveraging GenAI's LLM capabilities to chip design, successfully collaborating with Renesas on accelerating functional specification to final design. This is a key step in demonstrating the potential of LLMs to automate the translation of natural language specifications to final chip design and verification tasks, thereby boosting their quality and efficiency.We also renewed and deepened collaborations with some large semi and systems customers in the 5G, AI, hyperscale and connectivity areas. For instance, we strengthened our long-standing partnership with a global marquee systems company through a significant expansion of our EDA software, hardware, design IP and system solutions.As the digital transformation in aerospace and defense accelerates, we continued our momentum by enhancing our core EDA and systems footprint with several customers, including at two market shaping companies.Now let me share some of the business highlights starting with Digital IC. With 11 new wins, our digital full flow delivering industry leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, continued proliferating with market shaping customers. We are very pleased with the accelerating momentum of our flagship Cadence Cerebrus GenAI solution, whose transformative results have led to its deployment at all of our top 10 digital customers and in about 300 tapeouts to date. Imagination Technologies used Cadence Cerebrus and our digital full flow on its latest 5 nanometer GPU design in the cloud, to achieve a 20% reduction in leakage power.Next, I will talk about our Functional Verification business, which had another strong quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Ever-growing system design complexity coupled with the need for first time right silicon, continued to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 hardware platforms that provide industry-leading system verification and software bring-up capabilities. Our hardware business had a record Q3 with close to half of the hardware orders including both platforms. Highlights for the quarter included a major dynamic duo expansion with a top AI and automotive chip supplier, and a significant deal with a market shaping datacenter chip company.Our flagship Custom IC business continued to pave the way in analog innovation, delivering 15% year-over-year revenue growth. We're pleased with the reception to our AI-driven Virtuoso Studio solution as several marquee customers adopt it for their N2 and N3 designs, and it has close to a thousand downloads since its launch six months ago. And Nisshinbo Micro Devices utilized the Virtuoso Studio Custom IC design platform to gain a 30% reduction in turnaround time for routing analog blocks.In Q3, we continued investing in our IP business and closed the acquisition of the Rambus PHY IP assets. Customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive to the addition of their HBM and GDDR IP to our Star Design IP portfolio. Design IP had a record bookings quarter with strong AI and chiplet design activity, especially in the mobile, automotive and hyperscaler verticals. In addition, we launched our Tensilica Neo NPU IP and NeuroWeave software tools to accelerate on-device and edge AI performance.Our System Design and Analysis business that is driving our expansion beyond EDA continued to deliver strong growth, increasing revenue by 20% year-over-year. On the PCB front, Allegro X AI has several successful engagements with market-shaping customers underway, and we announced OrCAD X, our next-generation AI-driven PCB Design solution, enabled by Cadence OnCloud, and targeting small and medium businesses. Our Fidelity CFD platform continued its strong momentum with customers in automotive, aerospace and defense and industrial verticals.In summary, I'm pleased with our team's continued innovation and execution. We're well positioned to benefit from the tremendous opportunities ahead, as we help customers design their differentiated products with improved quality of results, productivity and shorter time to market.I did want to take a moment to comment on the unfolding conflict in the Middle East. The ongoing violence and the loss of innocent lives is truly heartbreaking and a matter of global concern. The wellbeing of our employees and their families in the region is of utmost importance to us and we'll continue doing everything we can to support them. Our thoughts are with everyone who has family, friends and loved ones there and we are helping out by providing humanitarian aid through the Cadence Giving Foundation.John will now go through the Q3 results and present our Q4 and updated 2023 outlook.Thanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone.I am pleased to report that Cadence delivered another strong quarter of top- and bottom-line results in Q3. All businesses contributed to revenue growth, and we completed more hardware installations in Q3 than we originally assumed.Here are some of the financial highlights from the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1.023 billion. GAAP operating margin was 28.6%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 41.1%. GAAP EPS was $0.93, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.26.Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter-end was $962 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow was $396 million. And we used $125 million to repurchase Cadence shares in Q3.Before I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to highlight that our outlook contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.Our updated outlook for fiscal 2023 is, revenue in the range of $4.06 billion to $4.1 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 30.5% to 31%. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41.5% to 42%. GAAP EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.54. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.07 to $5.13. Operating cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares.As a result, for Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $1.039 billion to $1.079 billion. GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 42%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.91. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.36, and we expect to use approximately $125 million of cash to repurchase Cadence shares.As usual, we've published a CFO Commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations.In summary, we are on track to deliver a strong 2023. I am pleased with our team's continued execution of our Intelligent System Design strategy.With our updated outlook for 2023, at the midpoint, we now expect: revenue growth of approximately 15%; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 41.75%, a seventh consecutive year of greater than 50% incremental operating margin; and non-GAAP EPS of $5.10, a sixth consecutive year of high-teen or better non-GAAP EPS growth.As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support.And with that, operator, we will now take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Charles Shi at Needham.Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you a little bit about the backlog. It looks like your backlog compared with last quarter was up. I mean, the September quarter kind of implies very good bookings for September quarter. Just want to ask, do you see the backlog will continue to grow into the year-end? Because you talked about the second half booking strength. I want to see where it goes from here. Thank you.Yeah, Charles, thanks for the question, and thanks for remembering what we said last quarter. Yeah, we expect a very strong second half for bookings, and Q4 is exceptionally strong. But -- so, our expectations for bookings is very, very strong Q4.Thanks. Maybe I want to ask a one quick follow-up. You kind of raised your full year revenue outlook a little bit less than you beat the Q3 in terms of revenue. It kind of implies that your full year outlook you provided one quarter ago was largely accurate, but there seems to be some timing shift for the revenue, I mean, pulling in from Q4 to Q3. Was that related to your comment about hardware installation, the timing of that? Thank you.That's right, Charles. In hindsight now, I was a little too prudent in the Q3 guide with respect to hardware installations that were scheduled in China around the end of September. If you recall in our guide, we assumed that those installations would fall into Q4. In actual fact, we completed those hardware installations, and the second half looks stronger than we thought this time last quarter. But even with all of those hardware, we kind of beat our expectations in Q3 and Q4 is higher than we thought.Thank you.Thank you. We go next now to Gianmarco Conti at Deutsche Bank.Yeah. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I guess my first one would be, when do you expect to be giving out more AI KPIs, whether on contract value uplift or penetration rates, or just, like, any color you can provide us on how can we quantify the AI tailwind in your numbers, and whether we are going to see this coming through in bookings in sometime? Thank you.Yeah. Hi, it's Anirudh. Let me take that. So, like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing a lot of activity in AI. And that's multiple customer and multiple verticals. So, whether it's the system company designing their own chips, or, of course, the semiconductor companies designing it, or we mentioned this time, for example, Broadcom, which helps other companies design it.So, we are participating in the AI kind of design process in all three ways. And last time we talked about NVIDIA and Tesla. And then, on top of that, it's also applying AI to our own products. And then, we have these extra generative AI products on top of our base products that also drives revenue.So, the first part, which is build out of the AI infrastructure, whether it's with, of course, large semi companies like NVIDIA, or like large system companies like Tesla, or companies like Broadcom, I mean, that's a big part of our business. We don't break that out specifically because it's sometimes difficult to figure out exactly what part of customer's business is AI or not, and we don't want to be in that kind of to try to guess what part of our -- what the customers are using it for. But AI is a significant portion of design activity and the buildout that's going to happen for years.Now there's a second part of our business in which we are selling AI products ourselves, like Cerebrus and Verisium and our JedAI platform, which has five main products. So in that segment, if our own software products and IP products are AI enabled, so in that, we did comment that even though it's early in the process, our revenue from our own AI products has almost tripled from a year ago. So, we are very pleased with that progress.So, I just want to highlight that, and also say there's another part of AI, which is the buildout of infrastructure, which is more difficult to predict.And Gian, I would just add to that when Anirudh calls out that's -- the revenue from those products has almost tripled in the space of 12 months, we're not reclassifying any revenue. This is direct revenue attributable to those five products that we have in our JedAI platform.Right. That's really good. Thank you. I just have a follow-up, perhaps talking a little bit on China. If you could comment on whether there is any impact from the entity list and the new rules come into place? And also, if you had any visibility into Chinese customers into trying to understand whether you actually know whether they're designing at more mature versus advanced nodes? I feel like there's been a lot of conversation around whether there is a way to track whether EDA tools are being used in China for mature versus advanced nodes. Any color on that -- on this, it would be great. Thank you.Yes, that's a good question because there were a lot of recent reports on some of the changes in regulation. So for us, there's not that much difference. Most of the regulations were targeted at some chip companies or manufacturing companies. As you know, we are in the design process. So those regulations, the latest round doesn't have a big effect on Cadence business.Now there are some companies added to the entity list. So, we monitor that carefully. But since we are so diversified geographically and in terms of customers, that's not a significant impact either. And all our guidance that we just gave includes the impact of all these regulations that were announced recently. And of course, we carefully follow all U.S. regulation. But the latest change is not that material to our business.Okay, thank you.Thank you. We'll go next now to Harlan Sur at JPMorgan.Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Macro conditions in the semiconductor industry are still fairly muted, right? We're close to a cyclical bottom, but recovery seems more gradual than expected across many different end markets, right? Accelerated computing, AI are strong. Auto, industrial, enterprise service provider market is still relatively soft. So, across some metrics that you track, renewals, hardware buys, IP take rates, is the team seeing any signs of hesitation or pushouts across your different customers or different businesses?Yeah, Harlan, that's a good question. Like we mentioned last time, we still see a lot of strong design activity. And I would say compared to like three months ago, I would say the activity is similar. Like you mentioned, some segments are going through tough times and then some segments like accelerated compute and AI have a lot of growth. But overall, as you know, these products that our customers are designing take several years to develop and we are part of the R&D cycle. So, what we see is the customers still investing in R&D or building our products for the future, and we are glad to partner with them. So, I think I would say that largely, the environment is similar than it was like a three months ago.Yeah, absolutely. And on the hardware side, we're producing hardware as fast as we were all year. And you can see in our 10-Q that we filed today that the value of finished goods and our inventory was less than $10 million at the end of the quarter in Q3. So, the demand is really strong still and we're just producing the hardware as quickly as we can. We're expecting a very strong Q4 as well for our IP group. I mean they're delivering a number of silicon solutions to our customers in Q4. And I think that sets up a really strong quarter for that group, but we were expecting that all year.Yeah. No, I appreciate the comments there. One of your large AI SoC customers recently laid out their future road maps, right? And given the complexity of all these next-generation AI compute workloads right, they're actually accelerating their chip road maps, so new GPU chip every year versus every two years, which was their prior cadence. And then on top of that, they're starting to segment their product lines, right? So, not only accelerating road maps but more chips per product family. I've got to believe that other competitors in this space are doing exactly the same thing. Are you guys seeing the step-up in design activity? Obviously, much higher productivity is required. So, how is this all being sort of reflected in the business momentum and your visibility?Yeah, good point. I mean like you said earlier, the macro environment is challenging, especially some of the segments are weaker, some are stronger. But design activity is very strong. And especially, I would say, in two verticals for the future, for the future of the semi and the system business, and at least the two very, very strong verticals in terms of design activity, is data center and AI, and then automotive, given the electrification and the massive transformation that's happening.So, if you look at even -- you know this anyway, Harlan, if you look at for the next three, four years, these two segments will grow significantly, the whole AI-driven data centers and automotive. And because they are growing so -- first of all, the cadence of those end customer products is increasing. And also, they need to be more and more efficient given the design activity and complexity is going up.So, there is more design activity and also use of AI to accelerate and be more productive. And even we are using AI internally to be more productive ourselves. So, definitely for these two big, big verticals, and this is a multi-year trend. This is not a -- and you mentioned some of our large customers, we are very fortunate to work with. We always say we want to win with the winners, and we always focus on the leading companies in the data center and AI space and also now in the automotive space. So that activity is strong, and I expect that to continue.Yeah. Well, thank you.Thank you. We go next now to Gary Mobley at Wells Fargo.Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. John, your upfront license revenue year-to-date has averaged around 17%. I think typically, it's 15%. Given where you're at in the verification hardware product cycles, Z2 and X2 and the conversion of the backlog there, how do you see that upfront revenue trending, looking into next year? And related to that, how would you see the influence on overall growth next year?Yeah, great question, Gary. I mean, we're always watching that carefully. As you know, last year, the upfront piece ticked up to 15%. This year, I think in the 10-Q, if you look over on a rolling four-quarter basis till the end of Q3, it's at 16% now, but I think your point is probably closer to 17% for the first three quarters. But I think that's a reflection of the strength of hardware. On the ratable and recurring part of the business, although that's 84% of the trailing 12-month revenue, if you look at our guide at [40, 80] (ph), I mean, we're assuming essentially about a 13% growth rate on a current revenue line for the year, but that's consistent with like over a three-year CAGR basis is about 13% as well. Of course, we're not guiding next year.Understood. All right. I suspect that we're not going to get any more AI metrics out of you, Anirudh, but maybe if you can just give us a sense of where we're at in the commercialization of the five different AI tools? Have those started working their way in the baseline license renewals? Or are they still on a per design basis and maybe it gives us a sense of where you expect them to cut into baseline licensing activity?Yeah, Gary, that's a good point. So, we are watching that carefully, of course. And as you know, like these JedAI and these five major platforms or new products that our customers should engage with us on and they run on top of our existing kind of leading platforms. So, it depends on the customers. I would still say we are still in the early stages of the adoption of these AI products because, as you know, any of these new software tools take years to fully deploy it, right? I mean, this sort of happened in digital or in any major kind of platform releases we do.So, even though we are like two years into it, I think it will still take some time to fully deploy these products. And what we have said in the past is typically at least in my experience with digital like about seven, eight years ago, it took like two contract cycles for them to fully deploy, okay? So that's still three, four years to go. You're probably like two, three years into it and still three, four years to go, which is a good thing in my mind because this is natural progress of deployment.Now, it depends on the customer. Some customers are adopting them in a much bigger way, especially -- like in the previous discussion, the new kind of AI design or hyperscalers, there is like an improved cadence of design activity. So they are adopting them maybe a little faster than some of the other verticals. So, it just depends on -- some are still on like tried on few designs or a few groups. But we have seen some pretty broad kind of deployment, and that helps our overall engagement with that particular customer.So that's what I would like to say, Gary, that I think it's still early, but what good thing, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that all top customers are now fully engaged and some of the results are truly remarkable. Actually, I was talking to one major customer recently, and they are getting like 8% to 10% power improvement from Cerebrus, okay? And we have mentioned several of these in the past also. I mean that's a huge improvement. Sometimes that's equivalent or roughly equivalent to a node migration. Typically, you go from one node to another, you may get like 10% to 15% PPA improvement, and you're getting close to that or roughly two-third of that from better AI tools.So the value is there. And that's what we are focused on, make sure the products really provide value and then work with the customers in the pace of deployment that they want to see because it's a natural process to try some and then deploy. But some of them are doing it much faster, like I mentioned.Thank you, both.Thank you. We go next now to Jay Vleeschhouwer at Griffin Securities.Thank you. Good evening. For my first question, I'd like to ask a variant of the EDA market environment question. So, on the one hand, what are you seeing in terms of unscheduled new business, that is to say, intra-contract new or expansion business that could be construed positively? On the other hand, how concerned are you about the evident deceleration of semi R&D growth? It's still reasonably good, better than four or five years ago, but so much lower than it's been. A lot of that can be attributable to Intel. But still, how are you thinking about those two different dynamics? And then I'll ask a follow-up.Yeah, hi, Jay. Good question. I mean, we are watching it carefully. Like you said -- like we said earlier, I mean, design activity is still strong. But of course, the macro environment is challenging. It's like natural -- even though the customers realize that they need to invest in R&D for the future, if the revenue is impacted because of macro situations, that decisions become a lot more prudent. But -- so this is just natural business process. But in general, still the large customers in the big segment, they're all investing in R&D, design activity is still strong. And then we just have to see -- we had a good Q3 in terms of bookings, like we mentioned. So, we'll see what happens in Q4 and that will also give us a better idea going forward.Jay, as you know, a lot of our customers come back and purchase add-ons during the course of their baseline contracts and with the teams releasing significantly new business -- new products from the different R&D groups that customers have an intent to come back and keep purchasing. So, they don't wait --- when we launch AI tools, they don't wait for the baseline renewal to come up or to expire to purchase them, they'll purchase add-ons and they'll purchase a few licenses and then hopefully proliferate more on the contract renewal. And as you know, we have a lot of contracts that come up for renewal in Q4.Understood. For a follow-up, I'll ask about some interesting Cadence management comments at last month's Cadence Live event up in Boston. So, there was an interesting comment about the role of AI as ""derisking schedules"" in addition to the design exploration use case. And what's interesting there is historically, schedule risk or completion risk has to do more towards the back end of the process, for example, physical verification. So, to the extent that more of that risk mitigation moves up earlier in the process, do you think that there will be a spending share shift within the totality of EDA spend, perhaps some from the back end, more towards the front end where you play with a lot of your tools?Hey, Jay, I would say that it should lead to more design activity if we are able to reduce risk in the design process. I mean, as you know, this is the history of EDA, history of automation, even for the last 20, 30 years. I remember in the old days in the '90s, we would take like five years and 500 engineers to design some big chip. And now that takes six to 12 months and maybe engineers. So that's like 100 times more efficient than 25 years ago.And I think AI can, as you know, provide the next generation, next level of improvement in productivity and risk mitigation. I mean, part of it is also risk mitigation. So then I think it should lead to more design activity, especially by the system company. Now the shift of front-end to back-end, I mean I think back-end is still a complicated process. And so, I think even though some of the things can be pulled upfront using AI or using hardware platforms, I still think the back-end design process requires a lot of work. So I would expect it affects all of them.And then, the other thing we are trying to do on the front-end, as you may have noticed, is really incorporate LLMs like our partnership with Renesas, because a lot of the front-end process has been less formal. The back-end process, especially once we have RTL, then we go to gates, we go to GDS, it's a very formal process, very structured process. But the front-end of the process, especially verification and specification, has been less formalized. And I think AI and LLM can help formalize that which definitely, like you said, can minimize the risk. But I think activity should still be strong in both front-end and back-end. And our goal anyway is to make the design easier, so more customers and more people can do them.Thank you, Anirudh.Thank you. We go next now to Jason Celino at KeyBanc Capital Markets.Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first for John, on the Q4 guide. Apologies for asking this again, but folks might be wondering tomorrow, I guess, why aren't we seeing more upside to the guide for fourth quarter? Because where might be some conservatism or what way will you be overlooking in terms of the setup?Yeah, Jason, as you know, your question probably emanates from the fact that we beat by $23 million in Q3 and raised by $10 million, but that was mainly due to a prudent guide for Q3 with respect to certain hardware installations. I think overall, we've taken the quarter up -- or the year up by $10 million at the midpoint. But I think there's -- because it's expected to be a strong bookings quarter and a particularly strong quarter for our IP Silicon Solutions group that -- I mean, they're having -- they're going to have an excellent Q4 that we're expecting that all year. I think if there's upside, it'll probably come from that group.Okay. No, that's fair. And then just my quick follow-up on backlog. I know you've got some weird comps because of the hardware stuff. But when might we see like year-over-year growth again? Or I guess if we stripped out the hardware-related backlog, I don't know if there's any way to share what type of growth you might be seeing?Yeah. I think just to give you a bit of color on that, I think if you recall, at the end of last year, our backlog included about 28 weeks of lead time on hardware. I think we're down to an eight to 10 week range now on lead time for hardware. So, of course, we've eaten some backlog as a result of that. But I think we troughed out essentially in the middle of the year. We're expecting the second half to be stronger for contract renewals, because the number of contracts expired in the second half. In Q3, you saw backlog starting to tick back up again. We'd expect it to tick back up again in Q4 because we have a strong bookings quarter, or we're expecting a strong bookings quarter.The one I'd look for really is the annual, the kind of CRPO is the one I track, because I'm looking at the annual value. And I think when you compare the annual value at the end of this year with the annual value of backlog at the end of last year, the thing to remember is the fact that there'll be so much less hardware in it, I would expect, because we have the production capacity now to deliver on the hardware.Okay. Perfect. No, it's super helpful. Thank you.We go next now to Vivek Arya at Bank of America.Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it's early for a '24 outlook, but Anirudh, I was hoping that you could give us some color given that your model is 85% recurring. So just conceptually, what is the likelihood Cadence can maintain this kind of mid-teens growth rate? And what would make '24 different or similar to '23 from a growth perspective?Yeah. Hi, Vivek. Like before, in Q3, we don't comment on the next year. We are diligent. We want to make sure we finish out the year, see what Q4 looks like, and then we'll be glad to share our assessment in our next -- in the full year, in the February earnings call. And that's what we have done in the past, and that has worked out well, right? So...Okay. On the IP side, I think John, you mentioned that you're expecting a strong quarter for IP in Q4. I was wondering how much would your two recent acquisitions contribute to that? And just longer term, do you think IP has a category over or undergrows the EDA? And does that influence your growth prospects? So both kind of near- and longer-term question on the IP business.Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll hand it over to Anirudh for the second part. I think in relation to the IP business, like I say, we're expecting a strong Q4 for that group. I mean, if you look at the guide we've given for the year, essentially, we're guiding to 14% to 15% revenue growth for the year, which means Q4 over Q4 is going to grow kind of between 15% and 20%. Now, largely that's due to the strength of our IP business in Q4.Do you want to talk about the longer term?Yeah, Vivek, I mean, as you know already, more customers are outsourcing their IP need, and we have always participated in that, and we have always said we want to participate in that in kind of a star IP portfolio so that it's more and more profitable. And the profitability of our IP business has improved over the last few years. And so, I think we are overall happy with the profitability of the IP business. So, now we're trying to see, okay, what other areas can it grow and maintain profitability?And I think the areas that are emerging, which are strong are this whole chiplet-based design and 3D-IC, and which are used for a lot of AI and hyperscaler applications. And that's also the reason we bought the PHY assets of Rambus, which is HBM and GDDR based IP. So, I feel now that our IP portfolio is in the right areas. And also the use of this automotive and hyperscaler and AI IP -- and most of these markets are evolving into chiplet-based and 3D-IC-based designs, which also has certain new IPs like UCIe and other things.So, as a result of that, we are investing more in our IP business as you saw, and then we expect a strong Q4, and then, we'll see what happens in '24.Just to clarify, the contribution from acquisitions is likely to be immaterial for this year. So, the strong Q4 that we're expecting is really from organic business.Thank you.Thank you. We go next now to Ruben Roy at Stifel.Thank you. Anirudh, I wanted to ask if you could maybe talk a little bit more in detail about the collaboration with Renesas and kind of incorporating Generative AI, LLM into chip design. I think you mentioned some expectations for quality improvement, efficiency improvement. I would think that longer term, you'd be thinking about productivity improvement as well. Are those milestones that you're expecting to have answers about within the next year, two years? It sounds like this is sort of a longer-term collaboration and sort of testing going on today. Just wondering sort of what you're thinking about timeframe in terms of incorporating some of these types of tools into chip design. Along with that, just the final part is, would you consider this a leading-edge design that Renesas is working on? Or if you could talk a little about the type of design, that'd be great. Thank you.Yes, absolutely. So, I mean, we are very pleased with the collaboration with Renesas. And I think they have a whole initiative, if you follow them or if you look into the AI for their design process. And we are glad to be very close partner with Renesas as we are with other companies, right? So, we just wanted to highlight Renesas this time and the collaboration is broad based.I think they're using almost all of our AI tools, whether it's Cerebrus for digital or Verification, Verisium and other tools. And also, we are doing some new collaboration with them on LLM, like we mentioned. And the LLM collaboration is fairly broad-based. It can be applied to any kind of design, especially Renesas has a range of design all the way from advanced node to mainstream nodes.And the other -- you may know all this already, but the key thing, one benefit of AI is that there's a, of course, the quality of results can be better, productivity can be better, but there are other benefits which are also true for large kind of global companies like Renesas. And the two that I would like to highlight, which came to the forefront with our partnership with Renesas.One is, all these large companies have geographically diverse teams, right? It's not that the team is only in one location. Typically, they are in multiple locations. So, the good thing with AI is that, and we can do, in a lot of cases, design better than a human can do, but also it depends on the starting point, right? So, if you have a geographically diverse team, not all teams are super experts. So, if the AI tool is same or better than your best team, then the reason to deploy it is that wherever -- just by the nature of human productivity, there's a variation across the organization, the results can be even greater in your teams which are historically not performing as well as you would like.And the other thing is also true in terms of experience. And this will happen, I believe, in AI in other industries as well, but it's definitely happening in chip design. So if you have three years' experience doing chip design versus 20 years' experience in chip design, okay, with AI, that gap is narrowing. So, less experienced engineers can be almost as productive as more experienced engineers. So, apart from like productivity and quality of results benefit, it has this other kind of almost workforce management benefit for large organization like Renesas, because they have organization in multiple locations and also a wide experience range from young engineers to experienced engineers. And this we are seeing in other companies as well.And I think what is also interesting is that the companies that adopt these AI tools first and faster will benefit more versus their peers. So, we are seeing that the fast-moving companies and Renesas is definitely one of them. And then we talked about, of course, Broadcom, we talked about NVIDIA, we talked about Tesla, and there's so many other kind of great, large multinational companies we have the privilege of working with.So, there are more than one, there's a whole workforce development benefit of AI, which is actually quite profound.That's very helpful. Thanks for all that detail, Anirudh. I guess just a quick follow-up. I mean, it sounds from what you're saying, this should be incremental. I mean, EDA has grown nicely. If you look at the core EDA growth over the last several years, you guys like to call out the three-year CAGR, but from what's going on here, we should assume that this would be incremental on sort of the way you've seen EDA growth. Can you comment on that as you think about whether it's software renewals or adding add-ons, as John talked about, over the next 12, 18, 24 months, would you say this would be incremental to sort of that mid-teens growth that the EDA tools have been growing at over the last three years or so?Well, I would comment on that. That's just, I think our style at Cadence is to be patient with our customers and we'll go at the pace that they're ready. As Anirudh said earlier in the call, we expect to proliferate our AI tools across our entire customer base over about two contract cycles. And some are adopting more rapidly and embracing the AI tools. Some are -- they're adopting the AI tools in add-ons, but they might be shaving back their configuration somewhere else. That tends to be a false economy because they'll part they'll just come back and purchase more add-ons later. So, to get the full effect, it probably takes a couple of contract cycles, but we're very, very pleased with the start we've made.It's very helpful. Thank you, John.Thank you. We go next now to Josh Tilton at Wolfe Research.Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Can you hear me?Clear.Great. My first question is just how does the 4Q hardware pipeline look compared to kind of some of the strength that you saw in the first three quarters of the year? And given that you mentioned that the macro is still challenging, is there any extra conservatism in the Q4 guide to account for the potential for maybe some hardware to slip into next year?Yeah, that's a great question. Pipeline is very strong. I mean the hardware demand just continues to amaze me that it's just tremendous. Those products are -- that verification group is just performing at a really, really high level and in such a consistent fashion through probably eight quarters now. But -- so very pleased with that.You might've noticed that we kept the same range on the guide from last Q3 -- from Q3 the same range, because we thought there's probably a broader kind of a array of potential outcomes with the amount of business that we expect to sign in Q4. We're expecting a strong booking quarter in Q4, and there is a strong pipeline for hardware.But like I said, in relation to the AI question, that we're very patient with our customers. We'll go with their pace. And naturally, if something slips from Q4 to Q1, it goes from this year to next year or vice versa, you can have stuff that customers are planning to buy in Q1, happening in Q4 as well. But I think we've accounted for that in the guide. Everything we know is in our guidance.Super helpful. And then, just a follow-up. Obviously, on AI, I can't not touch it. But as that business of yours triples, are you seeing the drive or the want to adopt these AI tools cause more of your users to make full flow decisions when maybe this has been more of a best of breed market historically?Yes, absolutely. That's a very good point. Because the AI tools, our AI tools will run on the full flow by nature, whether that's digital implementation or it is on verification. And of course, we believe we have best on breed tools anyway on the base. It's like you have to have the full flow, the basic engines to be best in class, and then add AI on top of them, which is best in class.But it is helping the underlying tools. So, when our customers are doing more AI tools, it also -- and also, as you know, we have commented in the past that the AI tools by nature use a lot of underlying tools. So, when Cerebrus runs, for example, which is our AI tool for digital implementation, which is one of the most difficult tasks in chip design, so it will typically -- the customers will use them on like, one run of Cerebrus will typically run on 10, 20 machines, okay? And each of them could be like 32 CPUs or 16 CPUs. So, they are using a lot of compute and also they're using a lot of underlying licenses. So, it could be like 10 instances of Innovus which Cerebrus is running. So -- and then it is also synthesis, place and route and sign-off, like in case of digital. And then logic simulation, formal verification, hardware in case of verification. And same thing with analog. It's not just Virtuoso, but it's Spectre.So, it's definitely full flow is enabled, but also typically it requires more instances. Because we're doing AI-based design or AI-based intelligent search of the design process. So, it will require multiple runs. Typically, instead of one or two runs, it may require 100 or 200 runs. But the user were doing that manually in a sequential manner, and we can do that automatically in a more parallel manner. So, it definitely helps. But it's still worth it because you get much better PPA. And it's like using more compute and more software, more automation in place of more human effort. And we can do it faster and a better PPA.Super helpful. Thank you, guys.We go next now to Joe Vruwink at Baird.Great. Hi, everyone. Sorry to belabor the backlog questions, but I suppose I'm going to. If we rewind two years ago and look at 3Q and the 4Q of 2021, current RPO then went up by, I think, nearly $400 million sequentially. Is that maybe how you would start to frame just renewal values that are coming to and what you could potentially look to build on?And then, second part of my backlog question, and it gets back to Jason's question on just the changing composition of hardware and software. Just given what Cadence has been able to do on production capacity and ramping there, does that change the relationship in terms of what needs to be sitting in backlog at year-end in order to support some sort of next 12 month revenue expectation?Hi, Joe, great questions there. I guess the way your profile last year's growth, a large portion of that growth would have been, of course, the hardware we weren't able to service at the time. And the reason I called out the lead times was, end of last year, that backlog and current year or the next 12 months backlog if you like, contained about 26 to 28 weeks of lead time for hardware. That sounds about eight to 10 weeks now.So, I guess to answer the second part of your question there, when you get to the end of this year, because we've ramped up on the hardware production, you'll need less to be in backlog for the -- there'll be less need for revenue to come out of backlog for next year's revenue than there was for this year.And like I said, we've kept the production levels at the same level all year. So, every quarter, we ratchet it up in Q1, and we've maintained that production level to try and reduce those lead times, because we think we're more competitive with customers. I mean, I was impressed this time last year, people were waiting over six months for our hardware solutions. But we'd be silly to assume that that would continue is important to get the lead times down to eight to 10 weeks. And I think that's more normal kind of -- more normal level to get to.But yeah, very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far this year. And again, we're not really talking about next year, but we've got a very busy Q4 ahead of us.Great. Thanks, John. If I can squeeze one more in, I think we're about to lap the OpenEye acquisition. I just wanted to see how that generally is tracked relative to your original expectations? And maybe just get an update about how Cadence is thinking about the opportunity from the Molecular Sciences group and the role you can play in life sciences looking forward?Absolutely. We are super excited about that. We're super excited about molecular design and the future. It's almost like where EDA was maybe 20 years ago. And before I talk specifically about molecular design, I want to tell you in terms of our product strategy and how that is synergistic and similar to.So, I see a lot of activity in our main products, which I would describe as like three layers. So, the middle layer is actual software products that we have, which are like either you're doing like EDA design or they're doing system simulation or they're doing finite element, computational fluid dynamics or molecular simulation. So, that's the middle layer of the cake.And below that is this new emergence of computational hardware, which is special purpose hardware. Like we had in the past, we had special purpose hardware with Palladium, which is our custom chip, but now we use FPGAs for Protium. We have of course, x86-based Intel and AMD CPUs, and then recently a lot of activity on GPUs, especially with NVIDIA GPUs and accelerated computing. So, that's the bottom layer of the cake.And then the top layer of that three-layer cake is AI orchestration. AI can provide this new level of automation and productivity and doing what was typically done by humans. It can be done with AI like we talked about Cerebrus or Verisium.So, this three-layer cake is central to our product strategy. So, the middle is simulation, which is physics-based, biology-based. The top is AI orchestration. The bottom is computational hardware. And then, this can be verticalized across multiple verticals, whether it's EDA and chip design, whether it's package design with Allegro X AI, whether it is clarity and optimality, whether it's CFD with fidelity, and more importantly, like you asked with biosimulation.So, the reason we acquired OpenEye is that gives that critical middle layer of physics-based biological simulation, which are very few companies that can do that but then we can add to it AI-based drug discovery and computational hardware with GPUs. So, as you may know, the OpenEye has a Orion cloud-based platform. It already runs on GPUs, giving significant speed up for biosimulation. And then recently, and we'll talk more about in the future, we expanded our collaboration with one major top five pharmaceutical company to do traditional and AI-based drug discovery on top of OpenEye and Orion platform.And so, I think this thing in the future, if you go forward, I mentioned in the last time also, the application of AI also, I think is going to go into three steps. So, first step application of AI is going to be in building out the infrastructure. Like we talked about, of course, the great companies like NVIDIA and Tesla and now Broadcom. So, the build of infrastructure and then there's so many other hyperscaler companies as you know, they are all building out AI infrastructure. So that's the first way of AI adoption.The second phase of AI adoption is applying AI to our own products, like Cerebrus and JedAI and Verisium, we talked about that today also. And that's going pretty well. And we talked about the progress in the last one year. And that, I think, will still take several years to go.And then, the third phase of AI adoption is AI applied to areas that were not automated in the past, okay? So, I think that may take longer, maybe five years plus, but that has to be driven to digital biology and life sciences. I mean, there's a huge application of AI and to do that properly, we need that three-layer cake and we need AI on top. We need biosimulation with OpenEye and then computational hardware with our leading compute platforms.So, I'm very optimistic about the future. It will take some time. This not happens in a quarter or two quarters, but it's right to invest for the future and it is synergistic with the other parts of -- a lot of the biosimulation is similar to what we do in circuit simulation or CFD and things like that.So, what overall I would like to say is still in the early innings with biology and biosimulation and OpenEye, but it is a good start and we are investing it for the future in a controlled way, of course. We're always financially disciplined. But I think the potential is there in the future for it to emerge as one of the big areas.That's great. Thanks very much, Anirudh.Thank you. And our final question comes from Andrew DeGasperi at Berenberg.Thanks for fitting me in. Just had two quick ones. I know most of them were answered so far on this call. But first on the margin, maybe could you lay out, John, in terms of the guidance for the year, I know you took down slightly the top end of the range for the operating margin on an on-GAAP basis. Just wondering maybe if you could lay out what the puts and takes are there? Is it revenue mix? Is it the recent acquisitions that you made that might have sort of crystallized that number? And without having to answer the second time, but like in terms of investments that you're making for next year, is the pace of all the hiring going to change at all based on what you're seeing right now?Great questions, Andrew. Yeah, in relation to the margin, the recent acquisitions are more dilutive to this year. So, we're picking up more expense -- we're picking very, very little revenue. We're picking up expense immediately. And that kind of narrowed the range on the on the margin outcomes for us that are at the midpoint of 41.75%. I think it works out to be about $5.10 on non-GAAP EPS.In relation -- what was the second part of the question? Sorry, I've forgotten the second part of the question.No worries. It's just on the terms of hiring, just in terms of how you're thinking about it so far.Yeah, I mean, it's great we continue to attract top talent to Cadence. You may notice, though, in our 10-Q, we did some restructuring. In August, we initiated a restructuring plan to better align our resources with our business strategy, and we incurred about $12 million of costs comprised of severance payments and termination benefits in relation to headcount reductions. But I would kind of categorize that as a bit of housekeeping and preparation for next year.Understood. Thank you.Thank you. I'm now going to turn it back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. A strong execution of the intelligent system design strategy and customer-first mindset continue to drive growth as we expand our portfolio with new innovative AI-driven solutions. We are proud of our inclusive culture and focus on enabling sustainable innovation and honored to recently be named to Newsweek's America's Greenest Companies 2024 list. On behalf of our Board of Directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence. Thank you.Thank you for participating in today's Cadence third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-23T20:55:08.000-04:00
Apple Support Levels On A Pullback (Technical Analysis),"On any pullback,  () price will shrink with market bites looking for support. On the charts below, we show the horizontal lines of support. We don’t know how many lines of support AAPL will break onThe support level that holds depends on the value that portfolio managers are willing to start buying again. We know that when price is over-extended that it reverts back to the mean. That could be the 50-day moving average in the case of a popular, buy and hold stock like AAPL, where buyers are willing to ignore valuation and pay a premium forAs you can see on the charts below, the 50-day moving average is near $186. There is also price support at that level and you can see the horizontal line we have drawn. So on any pullback in AAPL, we think the first test of support will be at $186.Then we wait and see how many portfolio managers are willing to buy at that level. If there aren’t many, then price will break below that support level. It will test the next price support level at $182, and that would be bearish break below the 50-day moving average uptrend.Notice also at the top of this first chart that we have our proprietary Buy, Hold and Sell Signal. You can see it is just below the green line Buy Signal. It is a very strong Hold Signal at 78 where 80 to 100 is a Buy Signal. The market will be very surprised if AAPL drops below $186 to test support at $182, based on our SID signal.Finally, at the bottom of this first chart is Relative Strength. Portfolio managers want to be in stocks that are outperforming the market. You can see that AAPL has dropped from an outperformer to a market performer. So portfolio managers with large positions in AAPL right now are just Indexing with this holding. That, of course, is better than underperforming the Index, but not as good as outperforming the Index which is their goal.Here is the first chart for AAPL that shows all of the data we just presented:On the second chart shown below, we can see the weekly overview of the long and overextended price move up. It is no surprise that AAPL is having a little pullback, because expectations were too high going into earnings. Also there is a little market pullback that is taking AAPL down with the Index selling. Once again at the top of the chart is our proprietary Buy, Hold and Sell signal. You can see how long AAPL has moved so close to our Buy Signal, but was not able to trigger it.All the signals on this chart are still positive, but weakening. You can see how overextended price is and the overextended signals that are now dropping. Just look at the MACD bar chart and how enormously long these bars were up compared to previous bars. Now the bars are dropping.Don’t forget that the weakness on this chart was before earnings. Now with the drop in price, after earnings, all of these signals will continue to show the weakness that we see before earnings.In conclusion, you can see we have drawn the Apple Inc. price support line at $178-$180. We think this is the target for this post earnings pullback. That will provide a nice 10% gain when price returns to the recent high. Let’s see if that is where the portfolio managers start buying again. They love to buy on weakness.Here is the weekly chart supporting the above comments:Use our free, 30 day training program to become a succesful trader or investor.

As we will be making forward-looking statements during the call, please refer to the cautionary notes included in the presentation, news release and MD&A as well as the risk factors set out in our annual information form. All dollar amounts discussed in this conference call are in U.S. dollars.I will now turn the call over to Gerard for opening remarks.Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I’ll begin our overview of our Q3 results with safety. A 12-month moving average total recordable injury frequency rate at the end ofFrom a production standpoint, OceanaGold produced just over 99,000 ounces of gold and 3,400 tons of copper in the third quarter. At the start of the year, we did expect Q3 to be our weakest quarter. However, as detailed in our September 14 news release, it turned out to be weaker than expected due to the poor grade reconciliation in the final benches of the Haile Mill Zone pit. Mining in Mill Zone is now complete. So that reconciliation issue is behind us and we have transitioned into a stripping phase at the Ledbetter pit.The third quarter was additionally impacted by disappointing production from Waihi, driven by an increased reliance on remnants stope material in the period. We expect to source more or from fresh stoping areas in the fourth quarter and finish the year with stronger production at Waihi. Despite its lower production, Haile celebrated a number of positive milestones in the quarter, including mining its 1 millionth ounce of gold since startup in 2017. Haile also delivered first development ore from the Horseshoe Underground in the third quarter.Subsequent to quarter end, Haile blasted its first stope and has now begun processing through the mill both stope and development ore. To think we only blasted the portal the beginning of the mine 13 months ago. We’re extremely proud of the team for achieving these milestones with the underground, safely and on schedule.At Macraes, the ball mill was repaired and returned to full operation in August with no further disruptions from this issue expected going forward. The rate of milling at Macraes is now higher than ever before as a result of some of the learnings derived through this repair period. And this high milling rate is why we expect the Macraes to perform strongly for the remaining of the year.During the quarter, we released some excellent exploration drill results at the Didipio [ph] with the results from both representing exciting upside to our current plans at those operations. Craig will share more about this later on the call.Moving on to guidance. Although Haile’s full year production guidance is now lower than originally expected, the strong performance and outlook at both Macraes and Didipio allows us to remain within our original group production guidance range. With three quarters behind us, we're tracking towards the bottom end of the original production guidance range for the year and have narrowed the top end of guidance to reflect these changes at a group level. Consolidated gold production guidance now sits at 460,000 to 490,000 ounces of gold with 347,000 ounces produced year to date.Copper guidance remains unchanged and we’re expecting to be towards the top end of the 12,000 ton to 14,000 ton range with more than 10,000 tons of copper produced so far this year. As mentioned, due to the lower production from Haile, our all in sustaining cost guidance of the year will consequently increase. We’ve updated group cost guidance to be $1,550 per ounce to $1,650 per ounce.Overall, total group CapEx and exploration expenditure is on track to be within our full year guidance of $330 million to $385 million. We know that delivering on production guidance is a key expectation in the market and our focus remains on delivering within original production guidance range while continuing to focus on operational efficiencies to safely and responsibly lower our cost in producing those ounces.Now to turn the call over to Marius who will provide an overview of our third quarter results.Thank you, Gerard, and good morning, everyone. As Gerard has mentioned, our Q3 production performance was our weakest quarter of the year. Consequently, we generated negative $30 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which included higher pre-stripping and underground development costs at Haile.However, a strong first half and an improvement expected in Q4 still positions as well to continue to repay debt when appropriate and invest in organic growth opportunities across the business.During the quarter, we repaid $15 million on a revolving credit facility. And in October, we paid our semi-annual dividend of $0.01 per share, totaling $7.1 million. Year-to-date, we have generated $759 million of revenue, EBITDA of $312 million and net profit after tax of $102 million.Our Q3 net loss after tax of $6 million was significantly lower than the previous quarter. When adjusted for the non-cash unrealized foreign exchange loss and other items, this equated to an EPS of $0.00 per share, fully diluted, while operating cash flow equated to $0.08 per share, fully diluted.Our financial position remains strong with $172 million in net debt and liquidity of $175 million at the end of the quarter. At a leverage ratio of 0.41 times, we have the financial flexibility to continue investing in the exciting growth projects across our business. This quarter we accrued $13.9 million for the additional government share per the terms of the FTAA with the Philippines government. This is the first accrual and the final amount due for 2023 will be finalized at year end [ph].Payable in Q2 of 2024, it was driven by strong operational performance and higher gold prices resulting in higher ounces and profitability. In broad terms, the Philippines government is entitled to a 60% share of net revenue once the company has effectively recovered its capital investment in Didipio.In Q3, we effectively crossed this threshold and expect to pay the additional government share moving forward.Net revenue is essentially a modified EBITDA calculation with all other taxes paid including production, income and withholding taxes forming part of the government share. It is in the nature of an income tax and for that reason excluded from AISC.With the first payment due in 2024 and given that additional government share payments are expected to continue annually thereafter, we will provide annual guidance based on the defined metal pricing assumptions going forward.I will now turn the call over to David to discuss the Haile operation.Thank you, Marius, and hello everyone. Third quarter gold production at Haile was 23,000 ounces. The quarter-on-quarter reduction was driven by lower-than-expected grades in the bottom benches at the Mill Zone pit. Mining from Mill Zone was completed on scheduled during the third quarter and has now transitioned to pre-stripping the next push back to Ledbetter pit, which is Ledbetter Phase 2. This will continue through the fourth quarter and our production from Ledbetter 2, we ramp up through the first half of 2024.As discussed in the recent September news release, Haile's full year production is now expected to be below the original guidance range set out at the beginning of the year. We have revised the range 140,000 to 150,000 ounces to reflect the year-to-date performance and as a result of the lower production we have also increased the 2023 cash cost and All In Sustaining Cost ranges. During the quarter, we continue [indiscernible] Haile, Horseshoe Underground with two rigs focusing on both grade control and resource conversion drilling from which we release some results in September. Craig will discuss more on those shortly.Now moving into Haile expansion; Q3 marked a significant milestone at Haile as we mined firstdevelopment ore from Horseshoe underground. Ore was mined on two levels and stockpiled on the surface during the quarter. In mid-October, we blasted our first stope from the 1025 [ph] level and have begun processing the stope and the stockpile development ore to the mill. Continue to advance development as we ramp up to full production rates by the middle of 2024.Grade control drilling in advance production has returned results in line with expectations, giving us increased confidence for the three stopes that we plan to mine in Q4.The detailed planning and execution has resulted in delivering ore from the Horseshoe underground in the fourth quarter in line with our guidance to the market set forth at the start of the year. We are delighted to announce that we were able to mine our first stope ore in October and I commend the team for the great work in making this to happen safely. This project will drive production growth and lower All In Sustaining Costs of Haile over the coming years and will make an out-sized impact for the future outlook and free cash flow generation for OceanaGold.I will now turn the call over to Peter to discuss the Didipio and our New Zealand assets.Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.At Didipio, second quarter gold production of 30,000 ounces and copper production of 3,400 ton were in line with our full year plan. When added to the results of a strong first half, we are tracking ahead of the original 2023 guidance. With that we've increased gold production guidance at the Didipio to between 125,000 and 135,000 ounces of gold and maintain copper production guidance, although we do expect to be at the top of the 12,000 to 14,000 ton range.Similar to year-to-date production, a strong first half cost performance has driven a $100 per ounce All In Sustaining guidance reduction for the Didipio. We are making good progress in our study to increase underground mining rates to at least 2 million ton per annum and positive results suggest that we will advance the study to a PFS level from a scoping study. We hope to be able to provide a summary to the market in the New Year [ph] and include the findings of the work in a fulsome updated NI 43-101 in the first half of 2025. We continued investing on community projects during the quarter in line with our commitments and exploration drilling is also progressing on ore body extensions with targets to the northwest and at depth. I will let Craig speak more about results released during the quarter shortly.Now on to Macraes. Macraes produced 35,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter, 12% lower than the previous quarter due to the additional work undertaken on ball mill 2. I'm happy to say that in late August we completed the full repair of the mill and it was returned to full production levels. Despite the challenges with ball mill 2 at Macraes this year, the team has done a fantastic job with other throughput initiatives that more than offset the losses from the ball mill downtime this year. With that we are increasing Macraes production guidance to 130,000 to 140,000 ounces of gold for the year and expect to be able to continue operating at these higher mill throughput levels going forward. All In Sustaining Costs during the quarter was $1,550 per ounce which is the second quarter in a row that we've been below guidance range. The higher than expected production has helped to drive lower unit costs and as such we are allowing our All In Sustaining guidance by $50 an ounce for the year at Macraes.Our Frasers underground operation was scheduled to be complete by the end of the first half of 2023 with focus shifting to Golden Point underground. We have pleasingly encountered additional remnant ore at Frasers underground, which will allow us to continue mining there into the first quarter of 2024. At the same time we continue to study the options around the Round Hill open pit and expect to be able to update the market as part of our annual R&R update next year.Now to the North Island of New Zealand where our Waihi operation produced approximately 11,000 ounces of gold this quarter. The decrease in production compared to the previous quarterwas primarily due to challenging ground conditions encountered in the areas of the mine where fresh ore stopes are located, resulting in us mining more ore from lower grade remnant stope and fill areas instead. We expect to move into higher grade fresh stopes in the fourth quarter and still expect to be within original full year guidance range.All In Sustaining Costs for the quarter was higher than the previous quarter driven by lower gold sales and higher operating costs, namely contract worker costs. We continue to work towards lowering these costs but given the year-to-date cost performance and outlook we are increasing All In Sustaining Costs guidance for 2023 at Waihi.I will now hand it over to Craig to provide an exploration overview.Thank you, Peter.During the quarter we continued our Brownfield exploration programs across the business focusing on creating value via resource conversion and growth. Starting at Haile during the quarter we released an exploration update, which delivered results from both Horseshoe and Palomino in line with and in some cases better than our expectations. One of our best holes drilled to date targeted the conversion of the lower Horseshoe Inferred Resource and intercepted 74 meters at 13 grams per ton gold and returned better than expected grade. This high grade zone at the bottom of the resource remains open at depth and is an exciting target that we're planning to drill in 2024. Our resource conversion program at Palomino has also been successful with drilling now largely complete. We look forward to updating the market on the progress in 2024.During the quarter we also released exploration results at the Didipio where we continue to convert resources and test depth extensions. Hole 611 for example returned 72 meters at 3.4 grams per ton gold equivalent, which provides further opportunity to extend the resource at least another 100 meters below the current existing inferred resource. Infill drilling continues higher up in the mine with results in line with expectations to date. Further drilling is planned for the remainder of this year and in 2024 to support a technical report in the first half of 2025.Finally at Waihi, drilling continues to extend the high-grade Southern Chute on the EG vein at Wharekirauponga. We're in the process of preparing a new drill platform to continue testing at strike extent. We have the third rig now drilling on site and expect to provide further updates to the market as results come in.I'll now turn the presentation back to Gerard. Thank you.Thank you, Craig.In summary, our third quarter results represent our weakest quarter of the year. We expect to improve in Q4 and deliver production within the bottom end of the original production guidance range. We are focused on safely and responsibly maximizing the free cash flow generation of the company and although Q3 was not a good quarter in this regard, it was a quarter of considerable investment and our outlook for organic growth and free cash flow generation in 2024 and beyond remains strong. Shareholders can be certain we remain focused on running the business well and investing wisely to create shareholder value and higher returns to shareholders.I'll now turn the call over to the operator and open up the line to take any questions.Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Ovais Habib at Scotiabank. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning, Gerard [indiscernible] me please. Starting off with the Haile Underground, obviously you guys are doing a lot of infill drilling, grade control drilling and into the stopes, you have three stopes prepared for Q4. Can you give us any sort of kind of information on how the grade control drilling has been progressing? I mean you talked about its inline, is it giving you confidence that [indiscernible] and the ore that you were looking for is going to be produced in Q4 and kind of any sort of insight on what 2024 might look like?Yes. Thanks Ovais. Thanks for the question. I'll hand it over to David for detail, but yes I thinkwe have to your point we have said previously that we expect – that we have grade control drilled all the areas that we intend to mine this year, and that gives us a high degree of confidence that what we expect to occur from underground will occur and so far it has performed accordingly.Now that's a couple of weeks of production, but David do you want to supplement that answer with anything?Yes. And also the grade control that the three holes that we drilled so far they're coming a little bit actually higher than the resource model is showing. So we expect that we are going to be at the resource model level or better than we expect. We're also using a little drill and we're drilling the bottom, the middle, and the top of the tunnels and again that information is coming positive. So we're very confident that we can achieve the tons and the grade that they were expecting.That's great David and thanks for that. And just David in terms of underground development rates is that kind of on target you need to be better in terms of opening up the mine on underground development? And also maybe if you can talk about how is kind of CapEx shaping up for going into the end of the year? Is that starting to taper off or should we see some of the CapEx kind of going into 2024 as well?So the development actually we're doing much better than we are forecasting. So we were doing through Q3 about 330 meters per month. October is shaping up to be a little bit of above 400 meters so we're very happy with the performance in the development. So some of the CapEx, so since we start the production now of the underground so we can have some operating costs and obviously the development is going to be capitalized, but the CapEx for the original project is pretty much finished.Excellent. Thanks David for that. And just the last question maybe switching gears to Philippines at the Didipio. Obviously there's an optimized study that's planned to come out in the next couple of months. In terms of how you're looking at that study, maybe there's a question for Gerard, like is this study going to give you enough information to go forward with the project assuming it's a positive study and or do you need to do additional studies to kind of give the green light to the project?Yes. Thanks Ovais. Look I'm highly confident that that the study will take us in some direction towards confirming and perhaps extending the articulated target of being at least 2 million ton per annum. I mean at one level it seems all very simple, it's like mechanical optimization but there is a lot of mine planning associated with that. So the scope and study we expect to move into a pre-feasibility study and so there is a bit of work to it.Peter, do you want to put any color on that answer?Sure. Hi Ovais how are you? Yes, so we will be entering into a PFS, Ovais, but I mean, I think what we're seeing already is that the outcomes of the scoping study are quite positive. So we'll be taking into a PFS because we need to and we do need to look at the various options around how do we actually take this project forward. But I mean the reality is we will be progressing in parallel any opportunity that's more business as usual around uplifting the underground rate just because we've identified through this process opportunity that we can just get after. Now, so I don't expect it to be a long drawn out two to three year study. I expect that we'll move from PFS quickly into fees and again the target is that NI 43-101 update in March 2025, which by that stage I think we'll have a very firm plan on what we can do and the target to go after.Thanks for the color on that Peter, and Gerard that's all for me. Thanks for taking my questions.Thank you, Ovais.[Operator Instructions] And your next question will be from Wayne Lam at RBC. Please go ahead.Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe just a follow-up in terms of the grade control drilling, seems like you had some issues at both Haile and Waihi and I recall last year there was a similar issue as well on the reconciliation at Waihi. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on I guess what happened at Haile on the mill pit? And if there's any steps that can be done to kind of help improve this grade control program or anything operationally that can help mitigate those surprises or volatility in grade?Sure. Thanks Wayne. Look I mean it's worth noting that Mill Zone, where we experience this under performance, sorry, Mill Zone 2 for much of its time performed within 1% of expectationas it relates to both grade and tones. So Mill Zone actually performed well but in the in that final quarter and quarter and a bit it actually underperformed because yes we were at the final two benches the grade control drilling was, that's at that deepest point the greatest grade control drilling was sparse. We had two drill holes into that at that depth one was that something like 4 or 5 grams a ton, the other was at 13 grams a ton.The methodology had the team interpolate an estimate of what the grade would be. But of course, that interpolation is a guesstimation and the guesstimation didn't pan out. The actual ore shaped differently to the interpolation. And so we like to think of Mill Zone having performed well. But in the stub – that final stub of the pit, it did not.So we don't think there's any systematic issue as it relates to Haile at all. And Ledbetter has performed well. And of course, we're at the upper benches of Ledbetter now which has a greater degree of grade control drilling. So we remain confident that Ledbetter that we intend to mine in coming years will not experience the same issues that the final two benches of Mill Zone did.At Waihi, that was a different issue. That was in the first quarter of last calendar year. And the issues that we experienced this quarter had more to do with the mix of where we were mining rather than grade control drilling per se. So it was not a grade control issue at Waihi other than when you are mining more in remnant stope areas, the level of grade control drilling that you can do in remnant stope areas is by definition less than you can do in fresh stopes.Okay, great. Thanks for providing that color. Then just maybe wondering if you can comment on some of the cost creep you're seeing at Waihi. And does any of that apply to Macraes in terms of increase in labor costs?Look, I mean, there's labor inflation across the board and universally globally, but the issues at Waihi as it relates to cost on a per unit basis are more due to the smaller number of units than anything else. Three quarters of the increase in the unit cost guidance and performance even in the quarter was due to the lower units. And labor inflation specifically mentioned in relation to Waihi is more due to the fact that we struggled to fill some seats and we had to get contract labor in. And by definition, contract labor is a little more expensive. The site have done a great job at kind of restoring that. But you can get caught short on headcount for certain roles at a point in time. As I said, we supplemented that with contract labor. But that number of contract labor is at Waihi is also reducing now as a result of recruitment efforts that have had effect since.Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe just last one for me. I just wanted to clarify on that additional government share. Did you guys say it will be paid out annually and next in Q2, and it includes the various local business taxes and excise taxes and then just also curious why that's reported separately and not part of your consolidated income taxes?Yes. It's a form of – what was just that last question, it's a form of income tax, but it's not an income tax. So I think for clarity, we'll break it out and show it separately. The nature of it is it's like an income tax, but it's technically not an income tax. And to your question, the answer resides in your question. We do pay it annually and it is as described by Marius as in essence an EBITDA minus all other government taxes paid. So it's a net revenue calculation. The calculation is actually in the 43-101 statement that we put out in March last year and all taxes paid to government, whether that be income, excise withholding and like are deductions in that calculation.Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.Thank you, Wayne.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question will be from Mike Parkin at National Bank. Please go ahead.Hi guys. Just one final question for me. Can you just give us an update in terms of water management at Haile in terms of you've got the bigger water treatment plant there and how is that kind of going? And overall, where have you kind of come from versus where you are versus where you kind of expect to be in the next 12 months? From what I remember from the site tour earlier this year, it sounded like you're going to be moving into better and better positioning with water management and that would also kind of help your cost structure going forward?Yes, great recollection Mike. And thanks for the question. I'll let David answer it in detail, but yes, I think water management at Haile is now a success story. David?Good morning, Michael. So the Ledbetter pit, which is where we are mining currently, we're down to the last 80 million gallons on that pit and we're moving about 100 million gallons a month. So we're going to be dry in that pit by the end of this month. Now this next [ph] pit where we have about 250 to 300 million gallons, that's going to be in the next three months. So by February we're pretty much going to be out of the contact water. So we will be pretty much just working as it rains, just pumping any contact water that just comes out of from drains. But we're pretty much out of the woods on that.Great. That's a great update. Thanks very much guys.Thank you Mike.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And at this time it appears that we have no other questions registered.Thanks, operator. Well, that concludes our webcast and conference call today. A replay will be available on our website later today. On behalf of the management team and everyone at OceanaGold, I appreciate you joining us and wish you a very pleasant rest of day. Bye for now.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-26T15:19:04.000-04:00

Gold Fields: Inflationary Pressures Weigh On Margins,"It was a mediocre Q2 Earnings Season for the Gold Miners Index (), with minimal margin expansion despite the record realized gold price. This was related to continued inflationary pressures felt sector-wide that offset the benefit of lowerGold Fields released its Q2 and H1 results last month, reporting quarterly attributable gold production of ~577,000 ounces and H1 2023 production of ~1.15 million ounces. This translated to a 4% decline from the year-ago period (~1.20 million ounces), with 3% lower production from its Australian segment, 5% lower production from its South Deep Mine in South Africa, 6% lower production from its Ghanian segment, 28% lower production at its shared Asanko Mine, offset by a 4% increase in output from its Cerro Corona Mine in Peru. The primary contributors to the lower output were Damang (lower grades with completion of mining at the Damang Pit Cut Back), lower grades and tonnes at South Deep (ground related incidents and a shortage of skilled labor), lower underground grades at Agnew and Granny Smith, and lower grades at Asanko. The standout operations were Gruyere, Tarkwa, and Cerro Corona, which all saw higher production, but this wasn't able to offset the lower output across the rest of the portfolio.Digging into the operations a little closer, Tarkwa produced ~297,700 ounces in H1 at all-in sustaining costs of $1,181/oz, with production up 12% year-over-year while costs dipped 10%. This helped the operation to generate $97.5 million in adjusted free cash flow despite higher capital expenditures, with higher grades (1.28 grams per tonne of gold) and a lower strip ratio. Unfortunately, the increased output and margin improvement was offset by its other African operations, with Damang seeing a 38% decline in grade and 37% decline in output and much higher costs ($1,193/oz vs. $884/oz) with the asset relying on lower grades from stockpiles and the Huni pit. Elsewhere, Asanko's grades were lower because of mining activities being halted last year (Asanko has relied on stockpiles in 2023) before a restart in mining before year-end. On a positive note, Damang is tracking ahead of initial guidance, a positive sign.As for the company's South Deep Mine in South Africa, it was a tough H1, with production down 5% to ~155,700 ounces, all-in sustaining costs increasing to $1,387/oz. The culprit was fewer available stopes because of a fall of ground incident, unexpected scaling of the 2 West ramp, sidewalls stability, and deterioration of the 2 West Cut 1A access drive, limiting access to stoping areas. Making matters worse, the company reported a shortage of skilled operators for long-hole stoping drill rigs, and these issues earlier in the quarter continued into Q2. Fortunately, free cash flow was up 31% year-over-year to $96.6 million (benefiting from lower capex), but the production delays have forced Gold Fields to reel in its previous guidance of ~347,000 ounces, revising to 321,500 ounces. In addition, it now expects its steady state run rate of ~380,000 ounces to be reached in H2 2025 vs. year-end 2024 previously.Moving over to costs and margins, Gold Fields reported company-wide AISC of $1,215/oz in H1 2023 (+ 6% year-over-year) and Q2 2023 AISC of $1,279/oz. These costs have continued to climb and resulted in limited margin improvement in Q2 ($676/oz vs. $674/oz) despite benefiting from a record average realized gold price of $1,955/oz. Given the weaker margins and lower production, revenue was up only marginally to ~$2.27 billion and operating cash flow slid to $735 million (down 16% year-over-year), with adjusted free cash flow more than halved to $140 million. That said, free cash flow was impacted by working capital movements and contribution to pre-construction activities at Windfall (50%), and the company still finished the quarter with a solid balance sheet (only $1.03 billion in net debt) given the period of elevated investment ($222 million Windfall payment, $34 million invested at Windfall and $202 million spent at Salares Norte in H1 as construction nears completion).Overall, the cost performance was a little disappointing, but with the high-margin Salares Norte Mine set to come online by year-end, we should see some offsets once it ramps up to commercial production in H2 2024. Plus, Gold Fields noted that the Windfall EIA was submitted in March, pointing to a June 2024 approval assuming a 15-month timeline. This would place Windfall on track to reach commercial production by H2 2026 (~160,000 ounces at sub $800/oz AISC on 50% basis in first five years), adding another high-margin operation to Gold Fields’ stable to aid in clawing back lost margins after two years of near unprecedented inflationary pressures. Finally, Tarkwa could see some cost improvement if the marriage of Tarkwa and Iduapriem is approved, providing a third lever to pull down costs. So, while the continued cost pressures at Gold Fields’ mines are disappointing, the company is uniquely positioned to drive costs lower, and we should see the first of these levers kick in with Salares Norte next year (construction 95% complete).Based on ~894 million shares and a share price of US$12.65, Gold Fields trades at a market cap of ~$11.3 billion and an enterprise value of ~$12.3 billion. This makes it one of the largest-cap gold producers in the sector today, and leaves it trading at ~5.5x FY2024 cash flow per share estimates ($2.30) vs. a historical multiple of ~4.9x cash flow. At first glance, this would imply that the stock is overvalued (given that it's trading above its historical multiple on forward cash flow). However, with the improvements we've seen to the portfolio (working to create a lower-cost Tier-1 scale operation at Tarkwa/Iduapriem, and it's acquiring a 50% share of the Windfall development project), and having a soon-to-be Tier-1 scale mine in Salares Norte, I believe a fair multiple for the stock is 7.1x cash flow (45% premium to 10-year average). If we apply this multiple to conservative FY2024 cash flow estimates, we arrive at a fair value for GFI of US$16.35, pointing to a 30% upside from current levels.That said, I am looking for a minimum 35% discount to fair value to justify starting new positions in large-cap producers, and especially those with less than 50% of their production coming from Tier-1 ranked jurisdictions. So, while I see upside in GFI from current levels and the company should look quite different by H2 2026 with a better jurisdictional profile (attributable ounces coming from Quebec) and a larger production profile, the ideal buy zone for the stock comes in at US$10.60 or lower after applying this discount. This doesn't mean that the stock can't go higher from current levels, but I still don't see enough of a margin of safety. Hence, I wouldn't rule out GFI revisiting the US$11.00 level before year-end, with a dampened outlook at South Deep (guidance revised lower), and continued cost pressures discussed by multiple producers (including Gold Fields which is forecasting 6.5% mining inflation in 2023 despite the benefit of a weaker Aussie Dollar).Gold Fields reported satisfactory results in H1 2023, and while adjusted free cash flow was sharply lower year-over-year, the decline was partially related to higher investment in working capital, contributions to Windfall (a newly acquired 50% stake) and it's without the benefit of the massive Salares Norte Mine which will should commercial production by Q4 2024. However, FY2024 should be a better year from a free cash flow standpoint, with the benefit of production from Salares Norte combined with a decline in capex with construction nearly complete at this Chilean asset. So, while the H1 2023 financial results may have come in weaker than expected, this is temporary, and the company is doing all the right things to make the stock more attractive from an investment standpoint. In summary, if we were to see GFI decline below US$10.60 before year-end, I would view this as a low-risk buying opportunity.

Hecla Mining: A Disappointing Setback,"Just over six weeks ago, I wrote on  (), noting that there was little reason to pay up for the stock ahead of its Q2 results. This is because the stock was trading at over 32x FY2024The massive underperformance can be attributed to the negative surprise at its Idaho mine, which is now setHecla Mining reported in late August that there was a fall of ground in the mine's #2 Shaft which acts as a secondary egress at an unused station that was under repair. Different  released reports about an underground fire on the  and 15th of August at the mine in Mullan, Idaho, with no emergency evacuations needed as no personnel were underground when smoke appeared. Hecla noted it believed the fall of ground incident to be related to the fire, with it occurring ~150 meters from the bottom of the active portion of the shaft. And while it was clear that there would be some impact to production, Hecla could not provide the magnitude of the disruption at the time of the August update.Unfortunately, the most recent update provided this week noted that production will likely be suspended for the rest of 2023, which should cause a near 2.0 million ounce shortfall to annual silver production. Hecla noted it will need to wait to bring the mine back into production with the development of a new secondary egress to bypass the damaged portion of Shaft #2, with this egress extending an existing ramp up ~490 meters and installing a ~90 meter long manway raise. For those wondering why this is needed with two shafts on the property, the tragic result of not having a second egress is situations like the  in 1862 that led to the death of 204 men (including boys) because of the beam of the pit's pumping engine fell down the shaft and blocked the escape. Unfortunately, with no secondary  and the mine filling with water and gas (pump no longer operating), over 200 lives were lost before help reached the miners.Looking at the image above, we can see that Lucky Friday has a #4 winze to skip ore and waste to the 4900 Level, a #2 Shaft (currently affected) which is ~1,700 meters and acts as an exhaust and secondary egress hoist capable of hauling multiple personnel and materials, and the Silver Shaft, a ~1,900 meter deep shaft with a 5.5 meter diameter to hoist material at a rate of 12 tons per skip. And while ventilation is back to normal, the fire has been extinguished and the Silver Shaft is perfectly capable of hauling ore and supporting mine production, it's the need for the secondary egress that is the issue. The unfortunate part about this required rehabilitation of the #2 Shaft is that it's occurring during a seasonally strong period for silver, not in the usual spring doldrums, so there may not be the normal benefit to leaving this ore down in the mine for a few months while the silver price suffers its typical April to June correction.The silver lining to the setback is that ) mill fire at Tasiast, which also led to a steep decline in production at one of its top mines, Hecla had property insurance (underground sub-limit of $50 million), with the policy likely covering much of the damage and business interruption, less the deductible. In addition, Lucky Friday may be down temporarily, but the company is more diversified than it was last year, with three mines still operating even if Casa Berardi is operating at razor-thin margins (FY2023 cash costs: $1,770/oz) currently during its transition phase to open-pit only. So, while a setback of this magnitude would be catastrophic for a single-asset producer with a weak balance sheet like it was for Pure Gold () and Aurcana (), Hecla can manage, especially with its high-margin operation continuing to hit new records and being a consistent cash flow machine.Looking at Hecla's consolidated guidance below, we can see that production is now expected to be ~15.0 million ounces of silver at the mid-point vs. ~16.7 million ounces previously, a very minor impact despite a significant negative surprise. And while this is the second negative impact following the guidance cut at Casa Berardi discussed in the Q2 results (~90,000 ounces at ~$2,125/oz vs. ~112,500 ounces at ~$2,010/oz in FY2023), Hecla will maintain its position as one of the largest silver producers from a silver-equivalent production standpoint despite this tough year. This is based on AISC guidance of ~$10.85/oz for its silver segment, translating to ~52% margins even at a conservative $22.50/oz silver price.Looking out to FY2024, Hecla should produce ~18.0 million ounces of silver and ~115,000 ounces of gold, a gigantic step down from planned FY2023 production levels if not for the interruption to operations at Lucky Friday. This is not ideal from a growth standpoint and certainly a disappointment, and this assumes that Lucky Friday returns to production with no issues and on time (zero impact to its planned 2024 production). Hence, with lower production, similar costs and even with metals prices cooperating, I would be surprised to see Hecla generate more than $115 million in free cash flow next year, a paltry figure for a company with a market cap that dwarfs many of its peers, even if it deserves some premium for its solely Tier-1 production profile with relatively long-life assets.Based on ~621 million fully diluted shares and a share price of US$4.25, Hecla trades at a market cap of ~$2.64 billion and an enterprise value of ~$3.10 billion. This is an improvement from where the stock traded at just shy of a ~$4.0 billion enterprise value in early August, but it's still a steep valuation. The reason is that Hecla continues to trade at over 27x EV/FCF using FY2024 free cash flow estimates (~$113 million), a 30% higher multiple than Agnico Eagle () at ~19x FY2024 EV/FCF which is arguably the sector's best producer (Tier-1 jurisdictions, ultra-low costs, phenomenal assets). I've found no value in paying over 25x forward free cash flow for mid-cap miners, and while Hecla is in the low end of its range at ~1.3x P/NAV, it still isn't cheap when growth stories can be bought for less than 0.70x in the gold space. Hence, although some air has come out of the stock, I still don't see this as a low-risk buying opportunity.As for other opportunities in the space, B2Gold () trades at just ~6.5x FY2025 free cash flow estimates, and while it may be riskier than Hecla due to having less than 40% of production coming from Tier-1 ranked jurisdiction, it's a low cost producer with greater scale that's paying investors to wait (~5.4% dividend yield). Meanwhile, Newmont () is arguably the most attractively valued it's been since March 2020 at less than 18x FY2025 free cash flow estimates on the eve of a transformation assuming the Newcrest deal closes (lower margins, increased diversification, more Tier-1 assets). So, with Hecla continuing to be one of the most expensive names sector-wide (~21x FY2025 free cash flow estimates), I continue to see better bets elsewhere.Hecla's setback at Lucky Friday and guidance cut at Casa Berardi have weighed on the company's H2 outlook and while FY2024 will be better, the outlook is less robust given the transition to solely open-pit mining at Casa Berardi. Plus, while Hecla doesn't expect any impact to FY2024 production, this is an added risk to the story at one of its more productive assets. So, while I would consider Hecla if the stock were to dip below US$3.80 where the stock would begin to offer some margin of safety, I don't see a compelling enough reward/risk setup here at US$4.25. Hence, if I were going to put new money to work, I see the more attractive bet being B2Gold at US$3.10 or lower.  Disclaimer: Taylor Dart is not a Registered Investment Advisor or Financial Planner.

Maxeon Solar: Battling Headwinds While Powering Toward Growth,"One year ago, I wrote  on Maxeon Solar Technologies Ltd. (); the stock had gained momentum until its most recent  earnings report. The company reported negative earnings, it missed revenue expectations and loweredWhile we should be cautious of the European residential market challenges, the ongoing , and the market slowdown impacting its performance for FY 2023. Over the last year, Maxeon has improved its top and bottom-line performance. Furthermore, significant moves put it in a position for long-term growth. Firstly its sales opportunities have grown within the US market, where it can now sell its own-branded offerings. Secondly, theWhen we look at Maxeon Solar, we need to consider that it is a solar player in many geographic locations and generates revenue through two targeted markets: Distributed Generation (DG), which is focused on the residential market, and Utility-scale, which are large-scale projects. Below is an update on these two targeted markets.Two significant updates regarding Maxeon are the launch of its US sales channel and the announced selection of Albuquerque, New Mexico, as its US manufacturing site. This facility is expected to significantly increase manufacturing capacity and contribute to reshoring the solar supply chain to the United States. The utility-scale business accounted for over 1.4 GW of annualised volume in Q2, with 90% in the US. The Mexican facility achieved total capacity, and Maxeon's focus is now on US expansion.The DG market experienced rapid changes in demand due to  and interest rate impacts. Despite challenges, Maxeon maintained strong average selling prices, achieved gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA above the guidance midpoint. Maxeon's strength lies in its diverse solutions sold through unique channels, which help it maintain growth despite market challenges.Maxeon initially generated excitement in Q1 2023 with positive EPS results; however, this enthusiasm waned in Q2 2023 as EPS turned negative and revenue fell short of analyst predictions. Despite the revenue miss, the company achieved 9% sequential and 46% year-on-year revenue growth. This expansion was primarily attributed to the company's concentrated efforts within the U.S. utility-scale market.In Q2, Maxeon experienced an increase in total shipments, with 807 MW, which represents a 4% sequential growth and a 55% year-on-year increase. The company's revenues reached $348 million, and the adjusted EBITDA was $30 million. However, for Q3 2023, Maxeon anticipates a decline in shipments, projecting 700-740 MW due to softness in residential demand. Despite this, the company still expects revenues between $280 million and $320 million, with gross profit in the low double digits. Additionally, Maxeon now projects fiscal 2023 revenue to be between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion, compared to its prior outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.It's worth noting that Maxeon's cash burn remains an area of concern, as levered free cash flow was negative at $76.5 million in this quarter. However, this is to be expected as the company is currently in a growth phase, which requires significant investments. Fortunately, the company has a total cash of $435.46 million, and its current ratio of 1.77 and quick ratio of 1.01 indicate that it is liquid enough to cover its short-term liabilities. Overall, Maxeon is making strides in the solar industry and is taking necessary steps to ensure its long-term success.Maxeon's short interest remains high at 17.06%, which indicates negative sentiment. However, it has reduced since my ; at the time, short interest stood at 21.94%.  have also cut the price target, which is at an average of , which still allows for a lot of  at its current trading price. We can see an impressive top-line growth YoY of 40.14%, although the upcoming quarters are expected to soften due to decreased DG demand. The company has yet to produce positive annual earnings, but it has an attractive EV-to-sales ratio of 0.64, which could indicate that it is currently undervalued.Investing in solar energy stocks poses risks due to their volatility, influenced by geopolitics and legislative initiatives. Maxeon's outlook is uncertain due to its contractual dispute regarding  with former parent company SunPower and a slowdown in the residential solar panel market. Regulatory changes may further impact demand for solar solutions. Furthermore, a lot of the potential growth will be determined by the yet-to-be-built manufacturing facility; risks and uncertainties are still involved, such as the type of loan the company will receive to make such a significant investment.Maxeon posted disappointing financial results in its Q2 2023 Earnings and has lowered the FY2023 forecast. We have seen the stock price drop drastically, and we should be cautious of the company's ongoing contract dispute, the slowing down of the solar residential market, especially in Europe, and the growing cash burn. However, over the last year, the company has improved its top-line results, is closing in on its manufacturing facility in the US and has increased its sales opportunity within the US. Therefore, I maintain a positive stance on the company.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Pete DeLongchamps, Group 1's Senior Vice President of Manufacturer Relations, Financial Services and Public Affairs. Please go ahead, Mr. DeLongchamps.Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. The earnings release we issued this morning and a related slide presentation that include reconciliations related to the adjusted results we will refer to on this call for comparison purposes have been posted to Group 1's website.Before we begin, I'd like to make some brief remarks about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Except for historical information mentioned during the conference call, statements made by management of Group 1 Automotive are forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Forward-looking statements involve both known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause the company's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks include, but are not limited to, risks associated with pricing, volume, inventory supply due to increased customer demand and reduced manufacturer production levels due to component shortages, conditions of markets and adverse developments inIn addition, certain non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, may be discussedParticipating with me on the call today Daryl Kenningham, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Daniel McHenry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.I'd now like to hand the call over to Daryl.Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2023, Group 1 Automotive reported $169.8 million in adjusted net income. Record total quarterly revenues of $4.7 billion, an all-time quarterly revenues across all major lines of business. Our teams also delivered record quarterly adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $12.07, an increase from the third quarter of 2022.Starting with our US operations. Our inventory levels remained relatively flat from the second quarter of 2023, no major shifts in mix, including from our brands affected by the UAW strike.In the third quarter, Stellantis was 4% of our mix; Ford, 7%; and General Motors, 10%. On a same-store basis, our used -- our US new vehicle unit sales were up nearly 12%. During the third quarter, 30% of our new vehicle sales in the US were presales, down a bit from 33% in the prior quarter.Also important to note, in a tough used vehicle environment, our used vehicle sales were up both year-over-year and sequentially and our gross margins were up year-over-year. We saw strengthening throughout the quarter in our used vehicle margins.In addition, we saw strengthening in our CPO business to nearly 25% of our mix. CPO is a key driver of loyalty and aftersales and repurchase and we continue to focus on organic sourcing, including acquisitions through AcceleRide customer trades, which were up in the quarter and service drive acquisitions.Our outstanding F&I team also achieved record quarterly revenues, capitalizing on the opportunities to sell products that are both good for our customers and good for their vehicles.Our gross profit per unit sold of $2,367 only minimally declined on a same-store sequential basis. We expect some continued pressure on finance penetration due to existing interest rates and slightly tighter lender requirements for some used vehicle buyers.Now shifting to aftersales. We focus on the aftersales impact on the customer journey by increasing customer retention through more convenient service hours, training of our service advisers, selling service contracts with vehicle sales and improved customer relationship management software that allows us to provide targeted marketing to our customers.We continue to believe that aftersales is an area of underinvestment in our industry and we invest heavily and without reservation when we acquire new stores. With this focus, our parts and service team continues to achieve record results, notching the tenth consecutive quarter of record revenues and an all-time quarterly high in gross profit.We continue to focus on the hiring and retention of technicians in this challenging labor market. Our four-day workweek benefits our customers by extending our hours of operation during the week and a return -- in return, leads to higher technician productivity in our shops. We continue to explore avenues to increase our capacity and drive more incremental productivity. We also continue to invest in new ways to reach our customers through one-to-one marketing technology and by using artificial intelligence.In the third quarter, we set over 360,000 service appointments digitally and through our customer development center. We also generated over 10,000 customer appointments with just six brands using artificial intelligence. We believe these AI customers to be incremental, and expect this initiative to grow and generate more incremental service business in the future.Now let's shift to SG&A. US adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit increased only 88 basis points year-over-year and improved sequentially, reflecting our focus on controlling costs in this inflationary environment and the structural cost improvements made since the pandemic. Current adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit of 61.4% continues to be down from 70.5% in pre-pandemic 2019.Now a quick look at the UK. The UK achieved record quarterly revenues, thanks to record used vehicle performance. Vehicle demand remains resilient and new vehicle availability is still constrained, keeping vehicle pricing and GPU strong. We continue to see signs of production improvement year-over-year by certain manufacturers as demonstrated by the near 10% increase in same-store new vehicle units sold.Despite this increase in same-store units sold, we experienced vehicle delivery shortages from BMW, Mini and Volkswagen in the third quarter of 2023, limiting our upside potential for the quarter. The lack of vehicle deliveries from these manufacturers resulted in higher-than-anticipated SG&A as a percentage of gross profit, giving our staffing levels, assuming the sale of these vehicles.As of September 30th, our new vehicle order bank was approximately 17,700 units. As a reminder, our UK business mix is predominantly luxury and those consumers are more resilient during times of economic uncertainty.And now to capital allocation. We deployed a return-focused capital allocation strategy that balances the use of our capital between opportunistic portfolio management, share buybacks and the return of capital to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends. This approach continues to benefit our shareholders, allowing us to achieve all-time high in adjusted diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations in the third quarter.Successful portfolio management involves not only acquiring great assets, but also disposing of assets for which we believe a higher return proposition exists. In the third quarter of 2023, we disposed of eight franchises and voluntarily terminated a ninth franchise. We intend to benefit our shareholders by using the proceeds from these sales to either buy additional dealerships or buy back additional shares.Our number one priority is growing the company. We evaluate all brands and geographies to expand our portfolio, seeking to acquire dealerships or dealership clusters in growth positioned or economically stable markets or that are economically accretive to our existing markets. In October 2023, we consummated the pending acquisition of a Subaru dealership in Manchester, New Hampshire, bringing the number of franchises owned in Manchester to five.Our recent acquisitions of Beck & Masten GMC and Kia dealerships as well as Estero Bay Chevrolet in Florida, serve as a reminder of the strength of this portfolio optimization approach. We continue to explore ways to consolidate our holdings in highly profitable, scalable dealerships and dealership clusters.We believe this is a critical element to our growth story, which leverages our scale and proven integration capabilities, optimizes our rooftop performance and grows the company in a meaningful and incremental manner.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Daniel McHenry, to provide a balance sheet and liquidity overview. Daniel?Thank you, Daryl, and good morning, everyone. As of September 30th, we had $53 million of cash on hand and another $211 million invested in our floorplan offset accounts, bringing total cash liquidity to $264 million. We also had $463 million available to borrow on our acquisition line, bringing total immediate available liquidity to $726 million.For the first nine months of 2023, we generated $555 million of adjusted operating cash flow and $448 million of free cash flow after backing out $107 million of CapEx. This capital was deployed through a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.During the current quarter, we spent $65 million, repurchasing approximately 246,000 shares, at an average price of $261.89. The result of this repurchase activity is just over a 1.7% reduction in share count over the current quarter. Our share count as of today is down to approximately 13.8 million.Our balance sheet, cash flow generation and leverage position will continue to support flexible capital allocation approach, including serious consideration of share repurchases, in addition to pursuing external growth opportunities.Our rent-adjusted leverage ratio, as defined by our US syndicated credit facility was two times at the end of September. Our strong balance sheet will continue to allow for meaningful and balanced capital deployment.Our quarterly floorplan interest of $16.5 million was an increase of $10 million from the prior year, entirely due to higher vehicle inventory holdings. We effectively managed our floorplan interest expense by holding excess cash in our floorplan offset accounts, reducing the balance exposed to interest as well as to our portfolio of interest rate swaps, which saved us $3.4 million of interest expense versus the comparable prior year quarter.Non-floorplan interest expense of $26.5 million increased $6.9 million from prior year. However, our mortgage swap portfolio saved us $3.5 million versus the comparable period. As of September 30th, approximately 65% of our $3.4 billion in floorplan and other debt was fixed.Therefore, an annual EPS impact is only about $0.66 for every 100 basis point increase in the secured overnight funding rate or SOFR which is the benchmark reference in our floorplan and mortgage debt instruments.For additional detail regarding our financial condition, please refer to the schedules of additional information attached to the news release as well as the investor presentation posted on our website.This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.Good morning, guys. Daryl, I just wanted to ask a question on inventory levels. You mentioned that they are tight and constraining your sales in the UK. But I'm just curious what your take is on inventory levels here in the US? And are they sufficient? Or are they constraining sales? And maybe kind of secondly to that, where do you think inventory levels are going, so that we can understand our floorplan interest expense may go?John. Good morning. I think the surprising -- I guess surprising -- maybe not so surprising thing about the inventories, Q3 over Q2, is they didn't change much on a day supply basis. I think we were up two days. And the mix between brands didn't change very much. We saw Stellantis coming down a little bit. We saw a little bit of remix with some of the luxuries. But I think that it's constraining sales in probably the import brands. And when you look at our day supply is still almost single-digits in those brands. And if you look at the sales growth that's there, and we still have 30% of our mix, was basically presold, which, at this point, I'm a little surprised by. And the -- so I think there's probably more inventory coming in those brands. I think the luxuries are probably in about the right place. I think they've got some mix issues to deal with between EV and non-EV. And then the domestics, I think, are fine in terms of their total. We'll see what happens with the UAW impact, especially with the plans that were announced this week.And if I could sneak in one follow-up on F&I. I mean it sounds like it's a slight pressure point, still doing fairly well. But could you just remind us what part of F&I PVR is product? And what is spread-based? And what your sort of thoughts on that going forward? I mean there's a lot of good product in there the consumer benefits from. So I'm just curious what you think the risk or even opportunity is going forward there.Hi, John. It's Pete DeLongchamps. So the -- we were very pleased with the overall F&I business. And I think it continues to be the headwind with used car penetrations were down about 400 basis points year-over-year. One-third of our revenue and gross profit comes from the spread and the originations, two-thirds from product. And I'll tell you, when I look at the overall results, our product penetrations haven't varied more than 100 basis points either way on any of our product penetration. So we're really pleased with the product sales that we've had, which has certainly helped keep our PRU numbers in line.John, one thing we do see is, as Pete mentioned, even though we're not -- we don't over rely on rate, when we do lose some attachment on financing, oftentimes, we're able to preserve some incrementality on the product sales. So as an example, don't take this literally, but if we lose three points of finance penetration on used cars, we might only lose 1.5 points or so of product penetration. So there's still some we're able to preserve.And our next question comes from Rajat Gupta from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the execution. I had a question on parts and services. Could you help us understand or help us gauge any potential impact from the part shortages, especially General Motor and Ford, where you have a little higher exposure? Anyway to quantify what that impact could be? When should we start to worry about shortages hitting your stores? Any color on that would be helpful and I have a follow-up.Rajat, this is Daryl. So far the impact has been minimal. We purchased ahead and stocked up on the fastest moving parts in advance of the strike or advance the contract negotiations, I should say. And so we're still able to -- we're still living off of that extra stock. We also were able to leverage our other stores around the country when we do have a part shortage. I don't think it's unreasonable to think that, in the next quarter, we'll start to see more part shortage issues from the two brands you mentioned. I don't know that they'll be significant. The OEMs have been fairly responsive with being able to supply us, but I don't know that it's -- I think it will probably be a bigger issue for us in Q4 than it was in Q3, but I can't say it will be severe.Got it. Have you already started to feel that impact in the fourth quarter? Or does the strike need to continue for another week or so before you start to feel that?Well, we won't have a full picture until after the quarter is over, so it's hard to say right now.Got it. Got it. Just on SG&A then, helpful color on the slide deck around the productivity improvements. In the past, you've given us some color around how much permanent SG&A to gross reduction you expect to see. I think you mentioned like 300 to 400 basis points in the past like this was probably more than a year ago. Curious as to -- if you have any update to that based on what you're seeing in the business, even in the UK? Any new guide rails or guardrails we should be thinking about in terms of what normalized SG&A to gross should be for the business? Thanks.Rajat, it's Daniel here. I think an important statistic to note that I don't think is in our investor deck is that we're still 7% down in terms of head count in the US versus 2019 on a same-store basis. And with that, we have added 11% more technicians. So the element related to SG&A is down even more than 7% in terms of head count. And at this time, I don't see any of that head count returning. Clearly, 30% additional productivity per salesperson. Again, I don't see us going back to the ways that we were pre-pandemic. So I think all of that cost reduction -- that people headcount that's added is added permanently. In terms of the guidance, I guess, that we've given, pre-pandemic, whole company, we were at 74% SG&A as a percent of growth. I don't see that ever being above 70%, all subject to recession or major changes in the industry.Our next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.Thanks. Good morning. Really impressed by the used vehicle performance. I wanted to just look at both sides of it really. Like how are you convincing the consumer, who is really struggling with used affordability, to pay over $30,000? But then on the procurement side, how are you keeping the GPU up as well?David, good morning. Daryl. I think we're being smarter about what we're sourcing and how we're sourcing. We implemented some new technology about a year ago, which helps us with acquisition and it helps us with pricing. And it's much more responsive. It takes more of our, for lack of a better word, our gut instinct out of it and relies much more heavily on data and market intelligence on a mass basis, not just on a car-by-car basis. And we're, I believe, leveraging that better today than we ever have. So I think we're probably getting some incrementality out of our used car performance that we have not seen in the past. And so I think that's the results of what you're seeing and I believe that's really the difference. We added some additional training in our dealerships around the country and some staffing around the country to try to help with the execution on used cars about a year ago as well and I think some of that is coming to fruition. So I believe those are things that are helping us. And we get, I mean, you know this we -- just the advantage we have of being able to source things organically is just a real advantage for us. And so we're -- compared to the used car pure plays. And so we're extremely fortunate to be able to do that.And staying on that topic, I mean, on the consumer side, though, they're really struggling. Are they -- have you changed your mix in any way to make it worthwhile to them to pay up? Or are you just able to get better?The ASPs are down a little bit, almost $2,000, I believe, year-over-year. So we are seeing that the pricing is coming down some. And we're responding with the right stock to be able to do that, and that's how we were able to preserve our gross margins. And so I think we're being more responsive with what we're stocking given the market today, that there's more pressure on it from a price and payment perspective.Our next question comes from Michael Ward from Benchmark. Please go ahead with your question.Thanks. Good morning, everyone.Good morning, Mike.Two questions. First one, a quick one. Are you seeing any change at all in credit availability for consumers? And then the second question is more kind of strategic. It seems like you're selling off some of the smaller stores and you're growing some of the bigger ones. And I'm guessing like that should imply that the parts and service departments get bigger. Am I reading that correctly?Mike, I'll take your second question, and then Pete will take your first question. This is Daryl. You're reading it correctly. You're reading exactly correctly. We're looking for our portfolio. We want to generally operate in clusters and generally with higher revenue rooftop stores where we can build and develop scale on a better basis. And that certainly helps us feed our parts and service business, which, for us, we consider one of our real strengths and something we invest heavily in. So, yes, absolutely. And when you look at our acquisitions over the last couple of years, whether it's Beck & Masten, or Toyota North Austin, or Estebero Bay Chevrolet, they are large, high-revenue stores. And for Beck & Masten and Toyota North Austin, they're right in the middle of a cluster of other stores that we own. So ability to leverage scale and ability to grow and leverage our SG&A base and drive more parts of service are all key benefits in that case. And then on the F&I question and the buyers and the lending environment, I'll ask Pete to speak to that.Mike, what we've seen with credit is it's certainly available. And I think that our strategy of partnering with the big banks in all different credit tiers is certainly paying a dividend for us right now. There has been some tightening clearly on loan-to-value and some of their metrics. But with the way we run our business with audit and compliance, our loss ratios are in line or better than with all of our lenders. So we've had great partnerships. And I ask our operators all the time, if we lost car deals due to credit? And it's -- that's a resounding no.We're also seeing the OEM captives really, really or get more aggressive right now. And I think that really helps us as new car dealers, obviously, give us an avenue to be able to rely on and support from them that they've stepped up with some additional programs and support as well.Daryl, if I could follow up on the dealership issue. You have a couple of good charts in the slides in there about the parts business and the growth and the benefits AcceleRide and EV sales. As vehicles become more complex, especially on the battery electric side, the service has to be done at the dealers because there is no independent aftermarket. Are your stores able to service some of these other start-up EV companies that are service constrained, call it, like a Rivian?Well, I hope that we have all the work we can do with our own brands. We haven't had any discussions with anybody like a Rivian or anything like that around any repair work or warranty work or anything like that. Could we -- I'm certain that if we work on the brands we do, we could work on those. But our focus is on the brands that we have relationships with today, Mike.Mike, can I just add two thing to that. It's Daniel here. We do the collision work for the EV. So we are approved that some of our collision centers for work and those start-up companies or more established EV operators.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead with your question.Hey, good morning, guys and congrats on the quarter.Thank you.Daryl, I want to start -- or a follow up on the service side. So obviously, trends remain strong there. You talked about parts availability. Let's go over to labor side. So you've been able to hire and retain for a while here with the four-day workweek, but I think you guys have been testing some new comp plans. Just curious how the reception has been? Is that helping you kind of maintain your lead on the hiring side? And has anything changed materially on the technician availability or retention?Daniel, thank you. Yes, we are still focused on attracting technicians and have had some success over the last year attracting them. Our turnover rate with technicians is down year-over-year. And then we are also piloting some different compensation plans that are -- we hope will make us a more attractive place to work and we hope will give technicians more certainty in their compensation. And right now, we've got that in about four stores that we're piloting and measuring. We want to make sure we maintain our productivity and our throughput, as well as employee retention and engagement, obviously, are super important there. So yes, we're testing that. We're also taking a hard look at our shop productivity, Daniel. There's traditional metrics around how much work we can put through our existing shop base. But then, are there some other levers we can pull to either increase the capacity of those shops or increase the throughput and productivity of those shops? And so we're taking a look at some things we might be able to do there. So -- we -- at the end of the day, we still see lots of room to run. And aftersales, we see lots of opportunity in aftersales. And we continue to want to invest there and think that there's going to be continued growth there for a long time into the future.That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then, Daniel, maybe one, is you're having about cap allocation. So you've made good progress, obviously, on the portfolio optimization. But curious what you're seeing. Are seller multiples continuing to compress in the M&A market as we move further from peak same-store earnings? And I guess with the stock multiple compressing and the cash flow generation, where do share repurchases kind of fall in your capital priorities from here just as you look at how to spend that free cash?Daniel, as Daryl said, our key priority is to continue to grow the company. I think it's fair to say there's a lot of potential acquisitions on the market at the moment. I think the market is more buoyant at the moment than probably it has ever been. Quality acquisitions are still more expensive and I think that the prices will continue to compress. We're going to remain balanced in terms of capital allocation as and when we think it's opportunistic to buy our stock back. We'll continue to buy our stock back and I think that was clearly messaged in our prepared remarks.And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call and presentation. We do thank everyone for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-25T14:17:10.000-04:00
Regis Resources Ltd (RGRNF) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Regis Resources Ltd () Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2023 8:00 PM ETJim Beyer - CEO, MD & DirectorAnthony Rechichi - CFOAndrew Bowler - Macquarie ResearchDavid Coates - Bell Potter Securities LimitedMeredith Schwarz - Bank of AmericaHugo Nicolaci - Goldman SachsThank you for standing by. And welcome to the Regis Resources Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].I'd now like hand the conference over to Mr. Jim Beyer, Managing Director and CEO. Please go ahead.Thanks, Darcy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on the Regis Resources September 2023 Quarterly Update. I'm joined this morning with our CFO, Anthony Rechichi who just managed to get out of being stuck in the lift this morning. So I'm grateful that he's here to answer to be part of this. Otherwise, I'd be on my own. Although having said that, Ben Goldbloom, the Head of Investor Relations is also joining us. So first off, looking at our key safety aspect and our frequency rate, our lost time injury frequency rate is well below industry average, as reported by DMIRS and WA with a frequency rate of 0.7. I would make a comment that we are seeing a slight increase in the less serious injuries. And I think we see that as a bit of a function of the lifting and skills turnover that we're seeing across the industry, or personnel turnover, I should say. So we're obviously keeping an eye on that to make sure we don't let that get too far ahead of us.We're very pleased to start the year with a reliable quarter of gold production and a modest cash build. This is the third consecutive quarter of cash buildAt Tropicana, the joint venture progressed, and the Havana underground project to the next phase. Now the Havana underground project has the potential to add seven years of life in addition to the current underground production or seven years of additional production to the underground. On the ESG front, we saw more than just safety improvements. So we commissioned the nine megawatt solar farm at Duketon South, which is now delivering a direct reduction in power costs and also on our carbon emissions. A key element in this period this time now besides the safeguard mechanism.At Tropicana, the joint venture has commenced the site works for the 62 megawatts solar, wind and battery facility. And overall for the quarter, we produced just over 111,000 ounces of gold for an all-in sustaining cost of a fraction over $2,100 at $2,160 an ounce. The September quarter was the first time all of our operating assets were in commercial production and it was pleasing to see them delivered a plan. Just looking a little bit more closely at our operations. The Duketon gold production was higher at just over than the prior quarter or just over 76,000 ounces for an all-in sustaining at $2,180 and at Tropicana we were just under 35,000 ounces for an all-in sustaining $1,859.Now it's important to keep in mind that Duketon’s AISC includes $227 per ounce of noncash inventory adjustment. Duketon North production was just under 1,800 ounces for an all-in sustaining cost of $1,925. Cash margins have improved in Duketon North, as waste movements have decreased as planned. The majority of mining at Duketon North will be completed by December 2023 as we get to the end of the Moolart pit. Some mining will continue at Gloster pit until the middle of next year in June. And this will represent the end of the current reserves -- in ground reserves. Following completion of the open pit, mill feed will be sourced solely from lower grade stockpiles, and will continue while they generate cash, once that ends or we don't deliver that and then we will put the site on a care and maintenance and we'll await further confirmation of the new deposits that we're working up at the moment potential new deposits.At Duketon South, production was nearly 59,000 ounces for an all-in cost of $2,258 an ounce AISC. Underground mining progress well, good development rates were maintained above 3,000 meters for the quarter. In the open pits mining with a Garden Well, Russells Fine and Ben Hur, and this will continue through the remainder of this financial year.At Tropicana, we delivered an improved quarter at approximately 35,000 ounces for an AISC of $1,859 an ounce. Now, we realized an increase in the AISC over last year, and I think we've already highlighted this or identified this before, but this is due to a shift in the classification as we move into commercial production, and the capitalized waste, stops being classified as growth capital and moves into AISC. Importantly, this is only a change in the inverted commas accounting classification, and the cash margins remain broadly in line quarter-on-quarter can be seen by the corresponding material reduction, of course, in the great cash flow of Tropicana, where spend for the quarter was nominally about $3 million. Following commercial production in Havana open pit in the June quarter access to ore is improved and is expected to continue in the current period. Underground ore production was the highest since we acquired our share of ownership in that asset. And debottlenecking activities have had a great impact. And we look forward to further improvement as the year progresses.So what I'd like to do now is hand over to Anthony to give us a little bit more insight into the financial for the quarter. Thanks, Anthony.Thanks, Jim. On to the financials for the quarter, we sold just over 106,000 ounces of gold and an average price of $2,560 an ounce that's Aussie dollars, which does include the effective hedges. This delivered $273 million of gold sales revenue for the quarter. Operating cash flows have been solid again. Overall, we generated just under $97 million in operating cash flows. That also includes a hedging with approximately $67 million coming from Duketon and $30 million coming from Tropicana.On that point, the biggest [inaudible] in the quarterly report, which outlines the cash flows for the quarter, cash and bullion closed at $250 million at 30 September, you can see that operating cash flows were $138 million. Partly offsetting this was $41 million in hedge losses, owing to the delivery of a further 30,000 ounces into our hedging program. You can see that over to the right of that waterfall chart at Figure 3. Furthermore, we spent $64 million on CapEx, [$79] million on exploration in McPhillamys and corporate and finance costs were $9 million. Regarding our debt as announced yesterday, the company signed that amendment deed with its lenders to extend the maturity date of the existing $300 million loan facility from 31 May, 2024 out to 30 June, 2025. The extension forms part of the broader funding strategy for the company's McPhillamys gold projects. Following the expected completion of the bankable feasibility study in the March quarter next year, it's likely the existing loan will be incorporated into a new financing package along with operating cash flows of our own to fund the project. Thank you. And back to you, Jim.Thanks, Anthony. And it is pleasing to see that within 20 minutes you're over the trauma of being stuck in the left. Okay, so coming back to touching on growth again. And our near future, our new term growth plans at all of our assets. I mentioned before Garden Well exploration is now, the decline has now finished and we're feverishly drilling out what we think will become a long and continuous mineralized system underneath the Garden Well pit. The initial drilling program will be finished at the end of this year. And we will at least be able to provide some progress updates on our biannual exploration report or update which will be in November to next month. At Havana open pit, we see the production hitting at straps and later in FY25, we'll see total waste movement start to decrease as we break the back of the stripping, while gold production will remain relatively flat. This will result in an uptick in free cash flow generation from that site. All other things being equal price of course, at Havana, underground that project has moved into the next phase, they're moving into the next phase was approved. The initial view is that the Havana underground has the potential to add a new production zone for seven years on top of the existing underground plants. And we're very excited to see this progress in the project. The Havana deposit is following a very similar maturity curve as its predecessors at Boston Shaker underground and also at Tropicana, and really reinforces why the entire asset is one of genuine two one assets going around, the value of the underground continues to grow well beyond the reserves, as they were two and a half years ago, the reserves that they were two and a half years ago when we bought the thing.And this is -- this ongoing growth that we're seeing in the underground is certainly in line with our views on value at the time. I continue to be really pleased with the fact that we acquire that asset and have it in our portfolio. At McPhillamys, we await a response on the Federal Section 10 application, we remain confident this will be cleared and completion of the DFS is expected to be in the March quarter. A final investment decision in the following quarter will likely follow the release of this study. Look, you can count on one hand the number of development projects with the scale of McPhillamys. And we're very excited to have that in our portfolio as well.On a final note here, I just like to thank Stuart Gula, who is leaving us after four years. He certainly made some material impacts on our safety and our operations and helped manage that through the COVID, the COVID era, something that I think we've all put to the dark recesses of our minds. And next week, I'm pleased to say that Michael Holmes will be joining us as the new COO. Some of you may know Michael, of course from his time at OceanaGold. So when you sum up the Regis investment case, we have existing assets that are demonstrating great cash generating capacity. We'll see a major cash flow inflection point in eight months in two days, with the hedging rolling off, and we'll also see this commencement of the decrease in waste movement at Trop. I suppose the reality as I said, I'd mentioned two days, it could be less as we're examining, and testing options to bring forward the end of the hedge work and [inaudible] here in the benefits earlier, potentially.One of the few growths, and we also of course, holding our portfolio, one of the few great development projects with scale being McPhillamys. So there's still time to get in while the stocks trading at cheap value. With such a relatively simple, we feel that readers with such a relatively simple story, clear production future and cash generating future that the market will see. And we'll see the -- this outlook reflected in the company share price very soon.All right. So what I'd like to do now is hand over to Darcey and we're happy to take on any questions that you might have.[Operator Instructions]Your first question comes from Andrew Bowler from Macquarie.Just, good morning, just looking at the commentary for Tropicana, you talk about the open pits delivering more ounces compared to plan. Is that just due to higher rates of mining than anticipated? Or was that a grade in terms of the resource model?Yes, no. Look, I think the context of what we were talking about there as the underground developing is adding ounces in life. We're seeing -- we've seen over the last couple of years that Tropicana has been replacing depletion and adding a little bit more. So we're pleased to see that continuing, we certainly pleased to see the potential with the Havana underground to continue with that by adding in new ounces, that are outside of, there is potentially new ounces that we haven't finalized. It's just a feasibility study, of course. So that's the context of what we're looking at here.Yes, I guess the other thing is we are -- we have seen a lift in back or the production levels at Tropicana are back to where people might have seen them a few years ago, certainly prior to when we bought them as the Havana cutback has hit commercial production. So we are seeing additional production coming from that but that's not -- that's what we expected to see that was part of the -- part of our expected value proposition that we were buying into back when we bought it just over a couple of years ago.Yes, apologies, I must have read that sentence wrong. The last one for me, on just your final comments there about potential to sort of bring the closing of the hedge book forward. Are you thinking of accelerating deliveries into the hedge book, or is that are you looking at sort of financial avenues to sort of bring the closure forward? Please just a bit more on that would be good thing.Yes, probably more of the latter than the former. And you don't want to, if our idea, and the options that we're looking at is really, does it make sense to take the book out completely. We got the capacity to do that. And how does that balance sheet look afterwards. Certainly our cash generating on a monthly basis at annualized $170 million a year, you're adding so $12 million to $15 million a month in additional cash flow by doing it. So there are a few things that we look at, I'm not sure whether we'd accelerate them, we'd probably just bite the bullet and take it out. But that's an option that we -- that's what we're evaluating at the moment.Your next question comes from David Coates from Bell Potter Securities.Good morning, gents. Can you hear me? Sorry about the [inaudible] lines since we dropped the internet this morning. Got a couple of quick ones. McPhillamys, I mean, let’s have the March quarter feasibility update and potentially FID June quarter and rather give us kind of any other getting any sort of concrete signs on this on the Section 10 coming through.I'd love to be able to but I can't. We've just been -- we've obviously been sent putting our inquiries into the department and getting the constant response, we'll let you know. But we're pushing on with this plenty that we can do. And as we work to finalize the feasibility study, so we'll just keep pushing on.Thanks. Yes, understood. In your commentary, you just mentioned the stockpiles Duketon North, they'll obviously come into the mix. It’s said just from the comment you made; it sort of sounded like it's potentially a little bit of a moveable phase with the gold price ticking up a little bit are there any sort of relapse processing run sort of like have extended in a higher gold price environment.Look, you're right, it is a bit of, it is very much a moving phase. We, pardon me, this low grade stockpiles are exactly what they as we described them, they're low grade they've been building over many, many years. And at the current price, so this time, last year, or probably 18 months ago, we thought there was viability, and I think I've always said if we make a couple of dollars an ounce, we'll do it. But the inflationary impacts on costs over the last 12 or 18 months have made that much more much harder and basically impossible. Because what we've seen, there's a pretty good gold price that we're sitting on at the moment. So that could influence it. Yes, we've got to wait and see how things look in the middle of next year. Or probably by the end of the March quarter, before we make a call on that. We, the key things for us are just making sure that we're managing the costs as best as we can. And we'll start we'll keep running with that over the next quarter or two. And then with that information, we'll also see whether the inflationary pressures have sort of eased a bit. Does it make sense to continue on or do we just put it into care of maintenance while we wait for other material.Right, sure. And finally, just on the Havana underground, the feasibility study there. Can you give us a bit of, I know I understand that it's emerging the work in progress, but can you give us a bit of a sense of scale of that operation compared to the Tropicana existing undergrounds at Tropicana?Yes, look, I'm a little bit reluctant to do anything too much. I mean, really, it's a conceptual, well, it's a little bit more than conceptual but we're still working on really what the options might be in terms of scale and in well annualized production. But there's still, I mean, it's material enough to make a difference to the underground production, which is why we're excited about it. And once we've got a little bit more information, which I'm hoping we'll be later next year, we'll be able to sort of expand a bit more and give an indication on the value that brings.Your next question comes from Meredith Schwarz from Bank of America.Good morning, Chairman and team. Thanks for the call this morning. And can I just follow on with McPhillamys? So I'm just trying to work out, if you're -- if you get delayed potentially, and you don't get the Section 10 until closer to the end of the year, say December. Does that mean that you're still going to stick to the March timeline for the DFS? Are you going to be potentially taking, reducing the sort of work that you need to do to feed into the DFS? I'm just trying to think about is there a fixed timeline to deliver or whether that could be pushed out? And what other work you may need to do after the DFS if you kind of cut a few corners there to deliver the timeline?Yes, look, I think the one of the things that we've been talking about is the Section 10 is limited access for us to get some construction quality into -- the construction costs related information. I guess we've made it, taken a view that will continue with the estimations. But at the moment that we're evaluating just how wide an allowance do we have to make for what we don't know, in terms of some of that geo tech. If we, so, I mean, in the end, you can set any date for if you like, within reason, of course, you can set any date for completing the study. But the less information that you've got feeding into it, the more variables, the greater the range of confidence. So we'll make a call as to as we get closer is that are we sufficiently confident that we could perhaps firm or land on a number that's got a couple of unknowns in it, but they're in an area that the risk is quite minimal or is it an area that we'd want to get more information before we finalized it. And of course, the subtle difference there is that we might land on it and publish our DFS, but not make FID until we've tightened up one particular risk area. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts in that because of, so I had that sort of answers the question, trying to get --Yes, it does. So you may refine some of your potentially your cost estimations between the DFS and feed and then make a decision on with FID with potentially some updated numbers. In the meantime, between DFS and FID side, so I think that answers my question. Thank you. It’s a little bit more clarity just on, yes, from what I wanted to know there.Yes. Look, our preferences, because you do an FS, a feasibility study, we don't want to have -- we prefer not to have uncertainty and say, yes, we've finished the study. But we haven't been -- we've still got more work to do to final to tighten up the numbers. That's actually the least desirable situation, because then you've got the sort of the worst of both worlds, you've provided a number and you haven't provided certainty. So that's not really what we want to do. We want to make sure we have to evaluate it as we go. But we're thinking that as we look at some of the detail, we're after, actually, the variability that might, we might have to provide for as a result of not having all the information might not be that significant. So we're just doing that work at the moment. So I'm trying to avoid saying we're going to come out with a study and then we're going to do more work and refine the number again, that's not what we want to do. That's, we'd rather than saying we come out with a study, and then we're going to do a bit more work and you know, what might go up more likely that our objective would be coming up with a study, and with a certain range of confidence, and if we feel it's needed, we might do a bit more work solely intended to restrict to limit up the potential contingencies, for example, rather than the absolute number.Yes, great. That's clear. Thanks very much, Jim. And second question on Duketon South, I noticed the grades were a little bit lower for the quarter primarily on that, the open pit in the transition and some extra stockpile material, are you expecting the grades to bump back up over the next 12 months as production stabilizes from those new sources? And sort of like looking at sort of similar levels to what you have over the last 12 months?Look, we'd expect the, I mean, I think if you look at what our numbers were for, our production was for the year, sorry, for the quarter and how that fits in with our guidance. We might sit we'll see, as you always do the grades shift and move around. But we've pretty well bang on we haven't made a comment about guidance. But we are clearly within guidance. And so we might see movements from, I'd expect that we might see mining grades lift a little bit, the milling grades will shift around, depending on which -- on the schedule that we've got lined up for each month for the low grade stockpiles that we might be feeding in. So we have low grade stockpile down at Duketon South as well. And if we have some spare capacity for a week or a couple of weeks, we'll shove load right into it just to help keep the mill full. But I don't, I think if you look at what our numbers are going to be over the year, we'll just see -- they're not going to see a spectacular rise in the grade and probably go up a little bit back in line with the previous quarter. But our production will remain reasonably consistent.Your next question comes from Hugo Nicolaci from Goldman Sachs.Good morning, Team. Thanks for the talk this morning. I just had couple of questions on cost. But maybe just quickly a follow up around that the hedging piece in closing that out early. If you're going to, as you put it by the bulletin and close the whole thing out, would that just be simply paying the difference between the hedge price and the forward curve on volumes? Or is there some extra phase in closing that out early?I'll answer that one for you, Hugo. Look, it's never quite exactly just the mark-to-market position. Because that's always calculated off a midpoint. There's a bit of a spread there that you've got to deal with when you're entering closing out those transactions. But it's quite immaterial amounts, insignificant, certainly in the context of the hedge.Yes, if you're trying to model the impacts, you just take the whatever the spot price is today, subtracted off the hedge, hedge value of 1571 multiplied by the answers, and you're pretty close. So many other things in our business to vary. So that's the thing for us that we evaluate, how much does that cost? What's that balance sheet looking like? What's the outlook? And the value in it? And can we do it without make a sensible move without putting our near term liquidity in issue? And we certainly with eight months, and two days and less approaching, it's making the potential for it to be a real option for us is certainly materializing.Great, thanks for that, guys. And then just on costs, looks like relatively low sustaining CapEx in the quarter. Just remind us of what the timing of that sustaining CapEx is across both assets for the rest of the year, just with regard to plant maintenance and the like.Yes, look, we haven't, there's obviously weighting in this quarter. I think if you did the simple math and multiplied Q1 by four, you'd see we're well over. But that's obviously impacted by timing and mine schedules and movements to commercial production and those sorts of things. So we're still holding not, we're keeping a close eye on whether inflation is pushing any of those unit rates up. And whether that's going to have an impact on our growth guidance. And we're certainly not seeing anything to make a decision on that at this point. The other thing that I would add as part of the Havana underground, there'll be a little bit of thought going into what additional extra unplanned development that we need to put in to access that area as part of moving the project into the next phase. And once we've got a bit of a handle on that, if it's material, then we'll let people know but I'm not expecting them to be anything of substance at all very much in the --That makes sense. I mean, and then just sustaining CapEx paces shutdowns and did you have any shutdown in the quarter and then broadly what the outlook for the rest of FY24 looks like there?Yes, we did. We had shutdowns across the board at Duketon. But I wouldn't see those as being overly mature material. I mean, I just and we gap pretty quickly.Yes. Okay, so then just this last one from a just [inaudible] a bit of step up in mining costs that drop in the quarter, is that simply just the factor and step up in underground? Or there's some other factors there as well?Are you talking about the all-in sustaining?Mining costs specifically?I think yes, because we've seen an increase in the proportion of underground production, we're just seeing a bit of an elevation in that. But of course, we're also seeing the pit, Havana pit is getting a little deeper, we're moving more material. And, yes, in terms of, there's no more pre-production at Tropicana that's going off into growth capital or anywhere, it’s all reporting into the sustaining costs.Your next question comes from Kate McCutcheon from Citi.Okay. I think the lines might have been mixed up, it’s Alex. Hi, Jim and team. Can you talk to if there any, if you've seen any further changes in CapEx expectations? At the June quarter, you mentioned that some costs had started to come down?In where sorry, Alex?At McPhillamys in terms of the future CapEx expectations?No, I mean, we still, I think we've been saying this thing $500 million or $600 million. It's a little bit too early to make any comment about anything materially coming down. I mean, there's certainly the pressures that were there 18 months ago, have dissipated, but then inflationary impacts have come in through that as well. So I think we've just got to wait until we see where that number plays out.Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Beyer for closing remarks.Okay, all right. Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. As always, if you've got any follow up questions, please give us a call, contact Ben and we'll do what we can to help you out where we can. Otherwise, thanks very much for joining us and have a good day.Thank you. That does conclude our conference today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T01:06:06.000-04:00
The Most Important Inflation Metric Is Back At Target Levels: SPY Implications,"The The rise of AI earlier this year boosted the technology mega-cap stocks - Microsoft Corp (), Apple Inc. (), Amazon.com, Inc. (As a result, SPY got off to a roaring start to the year:Since then, however, long-term interest rates have soared higher, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have increased significantly, and the assumption that interest rates will remain higher for longer has taken hold on Wall Street. Moreover, some of the aforementioned mega-cap tech stocks have posted Q3 results that disappointed Wall Street, further weighing on SPY. SPY is also likely suffering from the fact that it is trading at an elevated valuation andThat being said, some good news came out today, with the single most important inflation metric signaling that we are basically back to the Federal Reserve's long-term target level. In this article, we will look at the specifics of this more and discuss its implications for SPY.Today  that in September inflation remained stable without any significant cooling or resurgence, as reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The September Core PCE Price Index, the Federal Reserve's main inflation measure, rose 3.7% Y/Y, which was similar to the consensus estimate and slightly down from August's 3.8%.On a month-to-month basis, core PCE, which omits energy and food prices due to their volatility and sensitivity to short-term factors like weather and geopolitical events, rose 0.3%. Furthermore, the overall PCE Price Index increased 0.4% M/M, while on a Y/Y basis, it grew 3.4%.The best news of all is that - on a three-month annualized pace - core PCE has slowed to 2.4%. If the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate is ~2%, that means that inflation is nearly back to normal levels that we last saw in 2020:RSM US Chief Economist, Joseph Brusuelas, seconded this notion when he stated:Besides being the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures index is often cited as the best predictor of long-term inflation for the following reasons:Another piece of excellent news for inflation's outlook was that consumer spending - which is largely credited with being the main force keeping inflation sticky - surpassed personal income. Personal income increased by 0.3% M/M, while spending rose by 0.7%, pushing the personal saving rate down to 3.4%, its lowest level of the year. As a result, inflation is likely going to subside at an accelerated pace in the coming months as consumer spending is on an unsustainable pace and the saving rate is reaching low levels. As Morning Consult's senior economist, Kayla Bruun commented:With interest rates soaring and credit card debt at , it is highly unlikely that the consumer is going to be able to rely much more on debt to sustain its shopping spree moving forward. As a result, we think the conclusion is inevitable that we are on the threshold of inflation falling meaningfully. With Core PCE already nearly at the Federal Reserve's long-term target, a decline in consumer spending will likely push us below 2%, enabling the Federal Reserve to not only pause but likely begin to pivot towards cutting interest rates.Declining inflation and falling interest rates would  for the stock market, and SPY would be no exception. That being said, we also need to bear in mind that falling consumer spending would likely mean that a recession hits the economy as well, which will weigh on some of the less defensive names in the index, including mega-caps that are more consumer-facing such as AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN. After all, recent yield curve behavior implies that a recession is highly likely, as when the spread between the 10 Year treasury yield and the 3 Month treasury yield becomes negative (yield curve inversion), it has historically been a precursor to recessions, as seen by the ""Inversion Points"" in the chart below:Moreover, SPY is clearly overvalued based on several valuation metrics, including:As a result, while falling inflation and interest rates could potentially cheer the market up in the near term, a corresponding decline in corporate earnings due to an economic downturn will likely offset much of this initial cheer and potentially cause investors to take a fresh look at the lofty valuations that they have assigned to some of these companies.What does this mean for us as investors? For starters, we remain bearish on SPY and expect it to underperform its historical average returns in the next few years. As a result, we rate SPY a Sell.That said, with so much of the market priced for higher-for-longer interest rates, opportunities for investors certainly do abound right now. We think that hedging against geopolitical and financial crisis risk is certainly prudent right now, making gold ()() a particularly compelling investment at the moment. Energy () is also a compelling investment given the soaring geopolitical risk in top oil-exporting nations like Iran and Russia. That said, the risk of a sharp economic downturn could lead to significant near-term downside for oil prices should geopolitical risks not manifest into an actual supply chain disruption event, so we think that the risk-reward is more favorable in the midstream () portion of the sector right now.We also think that beaten-down quality defensive names in the utilities and yield co () and REIT () sectors make a lot of sense right now as these stocks offer very attractive dividend yields right now, are poised to soar in the wake of falling interest rates, while also providing strong protection against an economic downturn. As a result, we are buying precious metals, midstream, infrastructure, and REITs hand-over-fist right now, while avoiding SPY and the richly valued mega-cap tech names that dominate its portfolio composition.

Skyworks: Smartphone Headwinds May Grow For Years,"The semiconductor and electronic component market has been volatile over the past five years. Before 2020, and for sometime after, demand for smartphones and similar products steadily rose worldwide, creating solid growth and demand for semiconductors. Since 2020, supply-chain issuesSkyworks Solutions () is among the most directly exposed to the smartphone semiconductor market.  of the company's sales come directly from smartphones and the rest from various other end-products, of which around a quarterSWKS has not fared as well as most semiconductor companies. Since the beginning of 2022, SWKS has declined by around 29%, while the semiconductor ETF () is nearly flat. I was bearish on the stock back in 2020, with it losing about  of its value since then. At that time, I thought the company could face supply-chain-related pressures and was overvalued due to unreasonable expectations surrounding 5G. Since then, we've seen more widespread adoption of 5G; however, as expected, that has not boosted the company's income dramatically because the newer technology replaces a dated one at a similar cost. Further, macroeconomic pressures and slower technological improvements have led to a slowdown in smartphone sales. The company is seeing some growth in its automotive segment; however, that remains fickle due to uncertainty in the new vehicle market.Historically, Skyworks highly depends on smartphone sales for its income, mainly from Apple. While it has taken steps to diversify away from smartphones and Apple, the portion of its total sales from Apple only declined by ~2-3% since 2020 (). Further, Apple's total global iPhone shipments have fallen by  since the 2020 record (from seasonal peak to seasonal peak). Based on TTM measures, the total annual iPhone sales decline is closer to 10%, although its 2020 sales were abnormal because they were particularly low during the beginning of the year due to lockdowns. At the same time, Apple is making more money on iPhones, mainly due to price hikes and profit margin expansion. Unit sales, which are more relevant for Skyworks, are falling annually. Total global smartphone sales are also declining considerably, peaking around 2017 and down around .The smartphone slowdown is reflected in Skyworks' fundamental trends. Its valuation is low, related to its sales decline. Its operating profit margin is also slipping, with a similar pattern to total global smartphone sales (peaking around 2017). See below:SWKS's ""P/E"" ratio of 16.9X is below its average level of around 20X. That said, its valuation closely tracks its annual sales growth -13% YoY. The company's operating margin is also trending lower as its sales decline, and it loses its competitive edge, implying its income will trend lower over the coming year or more.Fundamentally, we must consider the facts and potentials of the smartphone market, including Apple and others on which Skyworks depends. For one, Apple and other smartphone manufacturers are vertically integrating  and will likely expand toward other electronic components produced by Skyworks. With operating margins of 26%, smartphone producers will probably find vertical integration of electronic manufacturing a pivotal way to grow or maintain profits in the current environment. Since the smartphone industry emerged around 2008, companies like Skyworks have been crucial to Apple, focusing primarily on pursuing innovation while outsourcing most manufacturing. Today, as the pace of innovation continues to slow, companies like Apple cannot continue to expand profits by releasing new phones. Still, they must also focus on vertical integration as they shift from growth to maturity.Of course, as the pace of innovation of smartphones naturally slows, people will also replace smartphones more slowly. Apple and global smartphone annual unit sales are trending lower as people do not feel the need to replace phones to ""keep up"" as often, given that most new models do not have hardware much better than older ones. This pattern is expected to grow over the coming years through , implying unit sales volumes should continue to fall globally. Indeed, many expected the 5G rollout to cause a surge in ""upgrade"" purchases, but most people were hardly  in it. Since 5G is likely the most significant technological hardware improvement of this decade, smartphone upgrade interests will likely be lower.This issue is the most significant for Skyworks because it will both negatively impact its sales and potentially dramatically hamper its operating margin as it begins to compete with its vertically integrating customers. Apple is aware of this trend and is reacting by  (to account for lower annual unit sales) and using its income to invest in vertical integration. Skyworks' largest customer is following the same pattern as any company in an industry shifting from growth toward maturity, and unfortunately, that will almost certainly  its profits as Apple's outsourcing needs decline.Skyworks is a cyclical company because most of its end products are sold to consumers (smartphones, computers, vehicles, etc.), of which most are higher-cost items. When excess economic demand is strong, people prefer buying higher-cost items with Skyworks electronic components. Today, economic data is a bit  prices; however, the manufacturing PMI points toward a decline in industrial activity. Historically, that measure has a considerable relationship with Skyworks sales trends. See below:There is certainly not a perfect correlation between these two figures, but the peaks and troughs usually coincide. Today, the manufacturing PMI is as low as it has been since 2008, excluding the substantial temporary decline in 2020. Skyworks sales are also falling quite quickly after solid growth in 2021, coinciding with the massive rebound in the PMI. As long as the PMI is below 50, we can expect generally negative trends in manufacturing activity, suggesting that Skyworks may lose sales due to macroeconomic pressures.In the US, economic demand is turning sharply in a negative direction due to savings and real median family income declines. Personal savings are around 3.5% of disposable income, much lower than before 2020. Median family incomes compared to services prices are also lower at about 2017 levels. See below:In my view, the trend in services prices (rent, healthcare, etc.) compared to incomes is the most telling because that factor is less influenced by commodity price volatility. As  in ""BND: Why Bonds May Crash Soon - A Deep Dive Into Inflation,"" inflation would still be around 6.1% today if commodity impacts were excluded - meaning it would rise if commodities do not continue to decline. Further, the on service prices has stagnated since the end of 2021, mirroring the trends most US households and businesses felt.Skyworks is tied to global consumer trends, not just the US. However, the US trend is generally telling of the worldwide trend. Key growth markets, such as China, might be even worse due to the country's tremendous economic , a fact the country is struggling to keep under . Of course, even US data may be overstated due to  in jobs and growth data. The Eurozone is also in an , potentially implying its historical financial issues may return to the surface.Skyworks is a very macroeconomically exposed company, and the broad global economic trend for consumer strength is undoubtedly negative. The company has been losing sales primarily due to a decline in smartphone sales, related mainly to technological improvement slowdowns. Looking forward, I expect that trend to continue, compounded by lower economic demand for smartphones, computers, vehicles, and other key products, as households are forced to reduce spending to make up for lower personal savings. Further, Skyworks may lose significant sales and profitability in the long run due to competition from its vertically integrating customers.In my view, Skyworks's pressure in the smartphone market is large enough that I expect its total annual sales will continue to decline, likely past 2024. Analysts expect its sales and EPS to  around the current quarter and rebound afterward. This bullish outlook may be due to hopes for a smartphone sales rebound with the . However, I strongly suspect that iPhone 15 demand will not be as strong as past launches because its specs are marginally improved, roughly equivalent to an . Of course, the price is higher despite consumer disposable spending headwinds. Thus, I am  willing to bet that the iPhone 15 will be one of the most disappointing in Apple's history. Further, I generally expect Skyworks income from Apple will fall as these issues continue over the coming years, likely compounded by pressure as the company vertically integrates.Electronic vehicles are a silver lining as Skyworks expands and  in that market. EV sales are also booming compared to pre-2020 levels. See below:Undoubtedly, economic headwinds will create pressures for EV sales. Further, only a smaller portion of Skyworks' total sales comes from vehicle components. This segment will be a crucial factor for the company as it shifts focus away from the maturing smartphone market to the growing EV industry. Will its new EV sales replace lost smartphone sales? Perhaps I would not heavily bet on it since Skyworks is still so dependent on Apple.Overall, I am slightly bearish on SWKS and believe it will most likely lose value over the coming year as it fails to see its sales and EPS rebound, as analysts expect. Further, I think there is considerable risk that its sales and operating margins fall over the coming years due to trends in the smartphone market and the economy at large. I believe its TTM ""P/E"" of 16X is not low enough to account for the potentially significant EPS decline it may continue to experience. While I would  AAPL today, I would not bet against SWKS because its valuation is not excessively high, and it could  see sufficient growth in non-smartphone markets.

Urban Outfitters: Limited Margin Of Safety At Current Levels,"Roughly two years ago, I  (), noting that while the stock reported record Q2 results and was benefiting from wardrobe refreshes post-COVID-19, the stock looked close to fully valued at $36.00. Since then, the stockUrban Outfitters released its fiscal Q2 2024 results in August and was one apparel brand next to Abercrombie & Fitch () and Lululemon () that outperformed expectations, proving the right assortment could overcome a tough macro backdrop. This was evidenced by record fiscal Q2 sales of ~$1.27 billion (+8% year-over-year) driven by strength in North America and exceptional quarters from its Free People, Anthropologie and Nuuly segments. And while its OU brand couldn't complete the quadfecta of positive comp sales, the company still managed to post 5% consolidated comp retail sales year-over-year as its other segments more than offset the softness at OU. And from a development standpoint, the company opened 9 net new stores in the period, including 5 Free People stores.Digging into the results a little closer, Urban Outfitters reported 26.9%, 10.6%, and [-] 14.1% comp sales growth at Free People, Anthropologie, and OU, respectively, with total Free People increasing 22% year-over-year to ~$331 million with traffic, transactions, conversion rates and AUR all up, besides strength in digital. Urban Outfitters noted it believes there's the potential for Free People Movement to potentially be a $1.0 billion brand in five to six years, and while it's an ambitious goal, American Eagle certainly proved that this was the case with Aerie under Jennifer Foyle, exceeding even its own expectations. In addition, it was certainly encouraging to hear commentary that the customer is "", suggesting that if the right assortment is there that its customers will pay up.Elsewhere at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters shared it was the 10th consecutive quarter of positive retail comps, and that it surpassed pre-pandemic traffic, conversion and comps both in store and online. The company called out apparel, accessories and shoes as areas of strength, and also noted that profit increased materially because of fewer markdowns, with momentum continuing into August. Urban Outfitters also shared that it has hired a new president of Anthropologie Home to improve its growth rates in this business, which has been an area of strength for off-price retailers like TJX Stores (). And elsewhere at the company's smallest but rapidly growing Nuuly segment, sales grew 94% year-over-year on 85% subscriber growth, with this being Urban Outfitters' new segment, a clothing rental and resale marketplace. In addition, the segment is getting closer to profitability with a DC in Kansas that will improve delivery times and reduce delivery costs to consumers.Unfortunately, we saw SG&A increase to 25.4% (+100 basis points) because of incentive-based compensation and increased marketing and creative expenses, and its UO brand still struggled despite the higher expenses. Urban Outfitters noted that this was the one disappointing segment with sales down over 10% on a two-year basis and that its comp improvement came up shy of its goals. And Urban Outfitters also shared that the turnaround could take longer than it expects at its UO brand with this news dampening what was otherwise a very impressive report for its other segments. The silver lining was that at least full-priced sales have improved and it's seen lower mark down rates, a trend that's consistent across its segments, which led to higher gross profit.Digging into earnings growth and the company's H2 2024 outlook, margins came in strong during fiscal Q2, with gross profits up 410 basis points, and the company also did a solid job controlling inventory which fell 16% to ~$586 million. The sharp increase in margins helped to push quarterly earnings per share [EPS] to $1.10 vs. $0.64, and FY2024 annual EPS estimates are now sitting at $3.24, pointing to 3% growth vs. the difficult comps from FY2022 (wardrobe refresh post-lockdowns) and a near doubling of annual EPS year-over-year. Notably, this earnings breakout (new multi-year high for annual EPS) appears to have further momentum, with FY2025 and FY2026 annual EPS estimates sitting at $3.45 and $3.60, respectively. So, while some brands are struggling to grow earnings and are struggling to hold on to market share like Gap (), Urban Outfitters is executing better than I expected.As for the company's H2 2023 outlook, I would normally be quite cautious with personal savings rates continuing to trend lower with the added impact of higher gas prices. However, Urban Outfitters certainly proved in its recent results that its better segments are performing well with double-digit growth and it's doing an excellent job executing while some other apparel brands are stumbling. Hence, although it might have been more sensitive if it was more heavily reliant on UO, the growth in its other segments now ~2.3x the size of UO vs. ~1.7x in fiscal Q2 2020. Plus, Urban Outfitters remains confident in further margin improvement in H2 of this year, suggesting that the fiscal Q3 results were not an anomaly if it can continue similar to momentum to what it's enjoyed year-to-date, suggesting the potential to beat fiscal Q3 estimates of $1,264 million. Let's dig into the valuation to see if the stock is offering a margin of safety:Based on ~93 million shares and a share price of $35.00, Urban Outfitters trades at a market cap of ~$3.26 billion and an enterprise value of ~$3.77 billion. This makes it one of the higher capitalization names in the Retail/Apparel industry group, ahead of names like Boot Barn () and Foot Locker (), and having a similar capitalization to American Eagle. However, with the stock now up ~95% off its Q2 2022 levels, I no longer see a margin of safety in place. This is because the stock is trading at ~18.0x free cash flow on an EV/FCF basis using FY2025 estimates, which leaves the stock close to fully valued (in my view), especially in the current interest rate environment where we've seen considerable multiple compression across most sectors. Meanwhile, the stock is trading just shy of its average earnings multiple of ~12.9 (10-year average), sitting at ~10.8x FY2024 earnings estimates ($3.24).Using what I believe to be a more conservative multiple of 11.0x earnings and FY2025 annual EPS estimates of $3.45, I see a fair value for the stock of $37.95, pointing to a 9% upside from current levels. However, while this might interest some investors, I am looking for a minimum 25% discount to fair value for mid-cap stocks to ensure an adequate margin of safety. And if we measure from an estimated fair value of $37.95, this points to an ideal buy zone of $28.50 or lower, suggesting URBN is nowhere near a low-risk buy zone following its gap-up and steady trend higher after its fiscal Q1 results. So, while the stock may be nowhere near as overbought as  which is trading in nosebleed territory and vulnerable to a sharp correction, I think there are better places to park one's capital currently.Urban Outfitters put together a solid fiscal Q2 report and, judging by the better than expected retail sales and positive commentary on fiscal Q3 trends, the company is likely to have another solid report when it announces its results in November. That said, I prefer to buy names that are hated or significantly priced (and ideally both), and while Urban Outfitters is very reasonably priced if it can turn its UO brand around, I don't see enough margin of safety to bet on the stock just yet. Hence, if I were looking to put capital to work in the Retail Sector (), I think there are better bets elsewhere like  () on dips.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.I would now turn the conference over to Bill Waelke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Thank you for joining us this morning for the discussion of the first quarter of our 2024 fiscal year. I'll briefly cover the non-GAAP and forward-looking language before passing the call over to our CEO, John Adent, who will be followed by our CFO, Dave Naemura. Before the market opened today, we published our first quarter results, as well as a presentation with both documents available in the Investor Relations section of our website.On our call this morning, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating our performance. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and the presentation, Slide 2 of which provides a reminder that our remarks will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks include, among others, matters that we have described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the SEC. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.With that, I'll turn things over to John.Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call covering the first quarter of our 2024 fiscal year. We've made significant progress across a number of fronts on the integration of the former 3M Food Safety business, whileFor Neogen in total, we saw core revenue growth decline by 0.4% in the quarter on a pro forma basis, which includes a negative impact from China of approximately 1%. In our legacy Food Safety business, core revenue growth was in the mid-single digit range, including positive volume growth in an end market where food production volumes continue to be down on a year-over-year basis for many producers. Additionally, certain producers have taken capacity offline in order to right-size the output from higher levels last year to the current environment.On our Animal Safety segment, we continued to see the impact of destocking in the distribution channel. Sales out of the channel to our end customers remained positive compared to the prior year with large veterinary distributors continue to reduce their purchases. Based on the data we have from the larger distributors in North America, channel inventories are at a three to four year low.In the former 3M Food Safety Division, the progress made with production levels at our transition manufacturing partner in Q4 of last year was maintained. For the former 3M division in total, core revenue grew by approximately 1% in the first quarter on a pro forma basis. Backlog remains at reasonable levels following the progress in the prior quarter catching up on past due orders, which helped drive a strong fourth quarter.We continue to work on rebuilding demand through targeted initiatives as we demonstrate reliable supply of Petrifilm and progress has been notable. Although pro forma growth was lower in Q1, impacted by weakness in Asia, a tough comparison against some elevated activity last year and a strong Q4 where we caught up on fulfilling orders, we have seen good progress so far in Q2 and remain very optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us.As we operate through a rather dynamic market environment, we are encouraged by our performance. The destocking and Animal Safety will ease as inventories right-size and end-user sales out of the distribution channels continue to grow. On the Food Safety side, we are dealing with a few challenges unique to us in Asia Pacific and macro weakness in China specifically that is common in most companies. However, outside of Asia Pacific, our Food Safety core revenue grew over 4% with positive volume despite the lower production volumes we see across much of the food production landscape demonstrating the resiliency of our business.On the integration front, the relocation of the former 3M pathogen and sample handling product lines in the Neogen facilities remain on track for completion in the third quarter. Hiring and training of new employees and inventory builds are underway as our initial equipment transfers with site preparation expected to wrap up later this month. These two product lines account for nearly 30% of the revenue of the former 3M business are a strong complement to the Neogen product portfolio that we're looking forward to have fully embedded within our operations. After these moves, we will have nearly 50% of the former 3M product lines fully integrated all but Petrifilm.The plan to exit the two transition services agreements. Those covering back-office functions and distribution are also on track to be completed in the third quarter. A key step that enables the exit of these agreements is the implementation of our new ERP system, which will allow us to take over order fulfillment services currently provided for the former 3M products. Last month, we had the initial go-live with our Food Safety business in the U.S. and Canada, as well as corporate, making the cut over to the new ERP on which we are now up and running.Implementation has generally gone well, in that we are fully operational on the new system, processing orders and shipping products, but as is typical, we are not as efficient yet on the new system as we were on the old. As a result, we've exited the month of September with an elevated level of open orders in our legacy Food Safety business that we expect will mostly ship in October and November. But, as we continue to work our way up the efficiency curve, it is possible that some level of revenue will shift from Q2 into Q3. What will be most important, however, is continuing to see end-user demand in line with our expectations and working diligently to satisfy it.The final phase of integration activities involves the construction of our new facility in Lansing, which will house the production of Petrifilm and other products from the legacy Neogen portfolio. The new facility continues to progress on track with construction of the exterior expected to be completed during Q3, at which point the focus will shift to the completion of the interior work and the installation of the custom manufacturing equipment.We're pleased with the progress we've made on the integration to date and are focused on the execution of the upcoming key transition activities in the second and third quarters that will bring the former 3M business closer to full autonomy within the One Neogen we're building.Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for some more insights into our results for the quarter.Thank you, John, and welcome to everyone on the call.Jumping into the results, our first quarter revenues were $229 million, an increase of 73% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Core revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions, and discontinued product lines declined just over 1% for the quarter. Acquisitions and discontinued product lines added a net 73%, while foreign currency was a 1% tailwind compared to the prior year. On a pro forma basis for the 3M transaction, core revenues declined modestly, down 40 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter or approximately $4 million to $5 million below our expectations, driven primarily by lower sales in Asia.In Asia-Pacific, customers were more impacted by the Petrifilm supply constraints we experienced last fiscal year, leading to what we believe will be a slightly longer path to demand recovery. Our China exposure is small, representing less than 3% of total company revenue, but worsening macro conditions there contributed to significantly lower sales in the quarter.Moving now to the segment level, revenues in our Food Safety segment were $166 million in the quarter, an increase of 157% compared to the prior year, including core growth of 4.5%. The core growth was led by the Bacterial and General Sanitation product category, which benefited from new microbiological testing business in the U.S. and U.K. Natural Toxins and Allergens also had solid core growth with a notable increase in sales of milk and gluten allergen test kits. Within the Indicator Testing, Culture Media and Other category, modest core growth in Culture Media was offset by a decline in food quality and nutritional analysis sales due in part to international distributor ordering patterns.Quarterly revenues in the Animal Safety segment were $63 million, a core decline of just under 7% compared to the prior-year quarter. Albeit generally in line with our expectations, Animal Safety revenue was a bit lighter than anticipated, driven primarily by the continued destocking at large veterinary distributors. This destocking was the primary reason for the core revenue decline in vet instruments and disposables, while supply constraints played a role in the lower sales of small animal supplements and vitamin injectables in the Animal Care and Other category. These declines were partially offset by solid growth in our biosecurity products with higher volumes in insect control products and cleaners and disinfectants.Worldwide genomics revenue was down modestly on a core basis with growth in international beef markets, offset by declines in poultry and porcine, driven primarily by the attrition of a couple of large customers in the U.S. In the former 3M Food Safety division, core revenue grew modestly on a pro forma basis, as John mentioned, which includes a compare headwind of a few points and also follows a very strong Q4.The Bacterial and General Sanitation product category saw the highest growth in this quarter with particularly strong sales of Clean-Trace Hygiene Monitoring products. This growth was partially offset by a modest core revenue decline in Petrifilm with the largest driver being the aforementioned weakness in Asia and China, in particular. Importantly, we were pleased to see that the improvements made in transition manufacturing during Q4 were sustained into Q1, providing stability of supply and allowing us to focus on demand-generating activities.From a geographical perspective, results were mixed. Growth was led by EMEA, which grew in the high single digits, and LatAm in the mid-single digits. USAC was down low single digits due mainly to the destocking of large animal safety distributors, as well as the lower sales in genomics, while the Food Safety business grew in the low single digits.Finally, APAC declined mid-single digits as a result of a slower-than-anticipated recovery in 3M demand following the Petrifilm supply constraints and also across-the-board softness in China. Recall that China represents less than 3% of our global revenues, but we experienced a decline in the high 20s, so the impact was measurable, particularly at the regional level.Gross margin in the first quarter was 51%, representing an increase of 400 basis points from 47% in the same quarter a year ago with the increase primarily driven by the addition of higher margin business from the 3M Food Safety transaction, as well as positive price cost. On a pro forma basis, gross margin expansion was 180 basis points.Adjusted EBITDA was $52 million, representing growth of 94% from the prior-year quarter, driven by the merger with the former 3M Food Safety division. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.9%, a year-over-year increase of 250 basis points, including approximately 100 basis points of negative impact from a non-recurring billing adjustment from our transition manufacturing partner and transaction FX. On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was 10 basis points, lower than we had anticipated due to the non-recurring items I mentioned and volume being a bit lighter than expected.Adjusted net income was $24 million for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 compared to $18 million and $0.16 respectively in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted net income was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, which more than offset the increase in interest expense, while adjusted earnings per share was negatively impacted by the increase in weighted average shares outstanding from the Food Safety transaction.We ended the fourth quarter with gross debt of $900 million, 67% of which remains at a fixed rate and a total cash position roughly unchanged from Q4 at $239 million, resulting in pro forma net leverage of 2.9 times and total liquidity of over $375 million.Although the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter seasonally, this year was a bit lower than we had anticipated, but generally aligned with how we anticipated the year developing. From what we have seen through the first month of Q2, the demand environment continues to appear consistent with what we had expected.As John noted, though, we are fully immersed in our ERP implementation, which will enable us to extract ourselves from the transition service arrangements we have with 3M. The inefficiencies he mentioned will make shipments more challenging in Q2, and we will likely have carryover of some Food Safety open orders into the initial weeks of Q3 as a result.Based on this dynamic, we could see a broader range of outcomes for the second quarter, depending on how the backlog of open orders develops. Our current base case view is that, we should see a modest sequential increase in revenue, which assumes we exit the quarter with an elevated level of open orders, as well as a modest sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA margin. If we do see some amount of revenue shift from Q2 to Q3, this would correspondingly affect the normal seasonality of our business in which the second half of the year typically accounts for 52% of the year's revenue.Based on our first-quarter results and the normal seasonality of the business, as well as the expectation of an improved end-market environment in the second half, we are maintaining our full-year outlook.I'll now hand the call back to John for some closing thoughts.Thanks, Dave. As you heard today, we believe we're making solid progress on the integration of the former 3M business and are on track to be completely independent from 3M in the third quarter outside of Petrifilm manufacturing, but we feel that arrangement is in a stable place. Our new ERP system is up and running after the Phase 1 launch, which is a significant step to have behind us. And we will work diligently through the backlog of open orders as we continue to become more efficient in our new ERP system.We still have significant work ahead of us though. With key activities taking place in the second, and third quarters, as we implement the final steps needed to relocate production and exit the transition services agreements. In addition to the important step of gaining full operational control of this part of the business there the associate -- there are the associated savings we expect to see from exiting the agreements and we fully anticipate ultimately achieving greater efficiency and utilization in our footprint.Having now crossed the one-year anniversary of the 3M transaction, we are excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our leading position in the Food Safety markets. Our sales and R&D teams are now approaching one year of working together on the combined product portfolio, building momentum that will result in new commercial opportunities, particularly as the market conditions improve.Our team members around the world have worked tirelessly on advancing the integration process and I want to wrap up here today by thanking them for their hard work. We have a shared goal that we are ever mindful of to remain the global leader in food safety and help protect the world's food supply.I'll now turn things over to the operator to begin the Q&A.Yes. Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. And I guess, first just to start on guidance at kind of a high level. I think some of the weakness in the quarter was coming from worsening macro, especially like in China, given update seem to be kind of negative out of there. Just curious, what gives you guys kind of confidence around reiterating the guidance range? Obviously, that was encouraging to see maybe an indication of the underlying momentum you guys are seeing, but, again, in kind of a worsening backdrop in macro that seems to be out of your control a little bit, what are you guys seeing that's giving you guidance or comfort in that guidance range?Yeah. Thanks, Brian, and thanks for being here. I think specifically to China, what we're seeing is that it's a relatively small piece of the business, it's only 3% of revenue. So, while China was a challenge, as we look forward, it was a particularly tough quarter that had a tough comp. But I don't think it’s going to repeat, so we don't see that big of a drag. For the overall markets, it's pretty similar to what we've been seeing, food production volumes are slow, the distributor channels destocking, that's kind of what we thought was going to happen for the year.And so, while this quarter was about a $4 million miss on what we expected it to be, we feel pretty comfortable about where we are on end-user demand. I think, like we talked about kind of the wild card is making sure that we're getting the product out the door with the SAP conversion. I'm really proud of the team on what we've been able to do under the SAP conversion. You hear all the horror stories, but you don't hear the good stories. This is one of the good stories, right? We're 40 days in, we're immediately able to do order to cash, build customers, pick pack and ship, manufacture, but we're just not as efficient and it's going to take us a little while to get that efficiency up, so we're caught a little bit behind. We think we can catch up in October, November, but as Dave talked about, there may be a little bit of carryover going into the third quarter. So, I'll let Dave talk a little bit more about guidance.Yeah, I think that -- Hi, Brandon. I think John summarized it pretty well. I guess I'd just highlight, we've talked about the first half being softer and that's what we're seeing. But outside of Asia Pacific, where I think we have some challenges that we noted in the prepared remarks, we saw, particularly, the Food Safety business grow pretty good outside on a global basis outside of Asia-Pac. So there is some strength there but I think the environment is not too different than we had anticipated.Okay. And Dave, maybe as a follow-up to that, you just hit on -- you guys mentioned on the prepared remarks a little bit that there are some, I think, the phrase John had used was that, unique challenges to Neogen in APAC. Can you guys maybe talk about some of those challenges that are unique to you guys? What you're doing to try to maybe fix some of those efforts?Yeah. What we -- what we mean by that was, when 3M was struggling with their production of Petrifilm, APAC was asymmetrically hurt regarding supply. And so, you had almost 24 months of supply disruption, which really challenged customers because they just -- they had to do other solutions and they had to find ways to continue to run their business without the Petrifilm product.And so, the unique challenge to us is, we have to earn back their trust, Brandon. We've got to show them we have supply. One quarter they're like great, but show me another quarter. So now we're two quarters in where supply is where it needs to be, but it's going back to those customers and winning back their trust that, now under our regime, we fix the supply issues that weren't able to be fixed for two years and earned their trust back and get that business back.Okay. And maybe I'll throw one last follow-up to that and then I'll let someone else get in queue here, but as you look at APAC and you're talking about winning trust back, you guys have a sense of where those customers are going. I think often when we talk to experts, they follow on kind of like backup plans, are they moving to competitors? Do you think this is kind of temporary? Any thoughts around that? Thanks.Yeah. It's a little bit of both. It's not so much traditional methods there. We did see some move to competitors, but we're seeing those customers come back. That's why I said in prepared I was encouraged, because we're starting to see that move -- that move back, but it's -- it takes you two years to lose them and it's going to take us a little while to get them back, but I think we're really confident that our solution and our -- the things that we provide around our product portfolio of solutions and people are just head and shoulders above our competitors. So we're going to get that business back.Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Daley of Wells Fargo.Great, thanks. So, John, just could you give us a bit more detail on the genomics? I think the term was attrition of two U.S. customers, please.Yeah.And did that impact the kind of like a below expectations revenue in the quarter?Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So, we had two large customers that are in very challenging markets right now, in poultry and swine and we're putting extreme pressure on pricing and other solutions for us. And for years these have been good volume customers but relatively low-margin customers. You've seen that we've been moving to transition the genomics business to different species that are higher value, higher margin, and when the pressure came and they wanted a significant price decrease, we declined. So we’ve made the decision that even though it's going to hurt us on volume, it wasn't as significant from a profitability standpoint. So that's really what drove that decision.All right. No, I appreciate that that detail. And just -- just thinking about those two customers, is there something that we could take out of the rev model here in terms of 2023 revenues? Any color around percent of revenues maybe those two customers that accounted for or would have accounted for going forward?Hi, Tim, it's Dave. I think it's in the guide. I would say the new news for us a little bit in the quarter wasn't these -- wasn't these folks. I would say, things came in generally a little bit lighter. I think some -- because of some of the end market pressures. But I think this more describes the kind of the absolute growth rate. I'd say it's contemplated in the guidance.All right. Got it. Perfect. And then thinking about the destocking, just I know new commentary around, I think the channel is that low -- pretty low levels here, just when should we think this rebound or how long should these low levels sustain of inventory before going back to normal or are we at new normal at low levels. Just additionally thought here on timing?Yeah, Tim, I don't think we're at a new normal. I think this is abnormally low and based on what we're seeing on end user demand, so we see what goes in and what goes out on end-user demand, like I told, we have always been bad at calling the bottoms, but to me, this is not a sustainable model. So I feel pretty comfortable, like we talked about the second half of the year where we think that you can't drive inventories down that low and it still provides the type of service levels that distributors want to provide to their customers. So I think this is a -- it's something that we contemplated and we think probably in the back half of the year is going to -- going to improve.All right. Got it. Then Dave, final one for me, and I'll pass along. So could you just walk us through the transition agreement here in terms of the pathogen and sample handling lines as a percent of like, you called it out, 30% of revenues? How much of the, I guess, transition manufacturing agreement costs are those product lines? And how should we think of like the day-one margin impact as those dual costs roll off, if you will?Yeah. Tim, look, we're obviously standing up a reasonable amount. There's costs from kind of move and kind of one-time in nature, but we're standing up recurring costs to accept those product lines in. And when those happen, to your point, we won't be paying the manufacturing transition fee. I think net-net, that's accretive to us; tough to quantify too sharply and some of the costs are overlapping, but we -- you had seen us put forward a schedule in the spring about where we expected to be from an integration standpoint at the end of our third quarter. Hopefully, it took away from the call that we feel at least here after the first, we continue to track to that.I think the other thing I'd add is that on the OpEx line, you know we have some duplicate costs as well that we'll see come out for the fourth when we -- when we're able to get to that point of integration that we previously noted. So just under 23% adjusted EBITDA margin for the first, I talked about 100 basis points of some kind of unanticipated headwinds, but there's probably another 100 basis points of duplicate cost in there. So we got to manage it well, but I think the fourth quarter and really the exit rate for the year is how I think about it, is where we should see us down to just manufacturing, transition fees related to manufacturing of Petrifilm, and then of course, that becomes an issue in the coming years. So maybe not as precise an answer as you're looking for, but hopefully that contextualizes it.No, that was great. Appreciate the time. Thanks, everybody.Thanks, Tim.Thanks, Tim.Thank you. And the next question comes from Dave Westenberg with Piper Sandler.Hi. This is John on for Dave. Thanks for taking the questions. So can you give any additional details on the ERP implementation? So, there was some revenue that was shifting from -- between the different quarters from the second quarter. So can you just walk us through what the implementation issues were, what the degree of the shift was, and what the areas were that shift was mostly around?Yeah. Thanks, John. Like we talked about in the prepared remarks, when you build a new ERP system, you will not be as efficient day one as you were on the old system, because you had spent 20 years on the old system and you knew it backwards and forwards. So, like I said, the good news was the business was up and running, we were able to do all the functions, nothing stopped. It's just we're not as fast and -- really around warehousing than we are in everything else that we were before. So, we're finding a way to continue to train the teams. We're seeing sequentially daily that that is improving day-by-day. But we had a period of time where that wasn't at our average and so we've to overperform to get to the average. And I don't know Dave has got a couple of comments on this. Dave?Yeah, just to make sure we're clear, so this didn't affect the end of the first quarter. So we went live for the first day of the second quarter. So what we're looking at is in the first -- the first month of our second quarter here and our shipments were out the door and we carried over open orders from September into October and that was low double-digit millions, whereas it usually be much, much lower than that as we ship at a slow rate, you got to make that up, right?So the question is, do we carry over some of that out of the second? So our goal here was to share, you know, I think first and foremost that the implementation went well. I think that's the headline. And as anticipated, maybe we're shipping a little bit slower than we otherwise may have and that we got our -- we're kind of calling it out as potentially a shipment timing risk for the second. Some of that might push to the third. But what we really got our eye on is the demand backdrop. I would say through the first month. Hopefully, you heard from us that feel supportive.Got it. Thank you. So, also we heard that Walmart had suggested that consumers are reducing their buying because of GLP-1. Are you actually hearing food producers saying anything similar?We're hearing the same things that you're hearing. Most of them are watching. They're understanding that it may have an impact. And we're looking at the same thing, John. I think, if you look at it on a relative scale and size of our business, GLP-1 will be a headwind, but it is going to be a relatively small headwind compared to the big tailwinds we have around this business, around increased regulatory environment, increased customer usage, expanding into new geographies, developing new products. So while it may be a headwind going forward, it is going to be a, I think, de-minimis headwind.Got it. Thank you. And just one last one. Sorry, if I missed it, but have you -- do you think that any customers stocked Petrifilm earlier in the year during supply constrained environment?Sorry, I didn't get the question. [Multiple Speakers]Yeah. Can you say it again, John?Yeah. Sorry if I missed it. But did -- is it your understanding that any customers stock Petrifilm earlier in the year during more supply-constrained environments?So, I don't think we've -- I don't think we've seen that. You know, I mean, as you know.Got it. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor to management for any closing comments.Thank you. Yeah. As we stated earlier, while the quarter was a little softer than anticipated, I think what we wanted to talk about was the success really of the integration and moving off our two transition services agreements and standing up ERP. And for those of you that have been involved in a lot of different companies, those were significant risk factors that could derail organizations. And I'm really proud of the team and the work they've done and the ability to plan and execute kind of seamlessly to continue to move to the new Neogen and the One Neogen environment. So, we’re really excited about the future. We look forward to talking to you in the second quarter. Thank you.Thank you. The conference has now concluded.

"Newmont: Margins Improve, But Production Below Plan","The Q3 Earnings Season for the Gold Miners Index () began this week and one of the first companies to report its results was Newmont (). Unfortunately, the results were a little below my expectations givenNewmont released its Q3 results this week, reporting attributable production of ~1.29 million ounces of gold, a 13% decline from the year-ago period. The sharp dip in production was primarily related to the company's massive Penasquito Mine being offline, but also to a softer than planned quarter at Ahafo despite the guided up-tick in grades (2.75 grams per tonne of gold processed vs. 1.89 grams per tonne of gold in Q3 2022), and lower production from its joint-venture partner at Pueblo Viejo (delayed ramp-up of PV Expansion). And while this was mostly related to one-time headwinds (Ahafo, Penasquito), the lower output at these mines combined with slightly fewer ounce sold vs. produced resulted in Newmont reporting a 5% decline in sales year-over-year with Q3 revenue of ~$2.49 billion.Digging into the results a little closer, investors will be pleased to know that aside from the 8% wage increase agreed upon between Newmont and the National Union of Mine and Metal Workers of the Mexican Republic, things are back to normal at its Penasquito Mine with a return to full operating capacity expected by year-end (resolution announced in mid-October). Unfortunately, the up-tick in production here will be partially offset by lower output at another of Newmont's massive assets, Ahafo, where the company noted that it identified damage to in the SAG mill girth gear that resulted in the mine operating below full capacity in Q3, which is why production was down year-over-year to ~133,000 ounces despite what would have otherwise been a 200,000 ounce plus quarter assuming a ~2.5 million tonne throughput rate. And while this did severely impact Q3 production and Newmont has optimized the circuit to operate at ~80%, full processing won't be reached until Q2 2024 when the damaged gear is replaced.Moving to Australia at two of the company's other largest operations, production was up year-over-year at Boddington (~181,000 ounces vs. ~174,000 ounces) on the back of marginally lower grades but higher throughput of ~9.1 million tonnes per annum. Meanwhile, at Tanami, production increased marginally to ~123,000 ounces at industry-leading costs of $890/oz after a slow start to the year (rainfall event), and this is a mine that will enjoy even lower costs once the Tanami 2 Expansion is complete, adding a shaft to the operation to a vertical depth of 1,460 meters. And as investors familiar with Newcrest will know, Newmont is expected to see a significant increase in its Australian production to 1.8+ million ounces per annum next year assuming Telfer is not divested. And these ounces will come at a lower-cost overall, with Tanami 2 set to improve costs and Cadia being a much lower-cost operation, with AISC at Cadia of $45/oz.Looking out across some of the smaller assets in the portfolio, Newmont's Canadian production declined year-over-year to ~162,000 ounces (Q3 2022: ~175,000 ounces), with the higher production at Musselwhite and Eleonore offset by lower output at Porcupine. And while Newmont's output from Canada will also increase materially in Q4, with the addition of Red Chris (70% of a copper/gold mine), and Brucejack (high-grade underground gold mine), costs for its Canadian operations will remain elevated with costs at these operations continuing to be well above the sector average, with year-to-date AISC of $1,869/oz, $1,545/oz, and $1,855/oz at Musselwhite, Porcupine, and Eleonore, respectively. And while this is partially because of higher sustaining capital, these assets continue to be a drag on the company's overall cost performance.Finally, as for Yanacocha, Cerro Negro, Merian and Akyem, production was higher at Cerro Negro (higher grades and throughput) and Yanacocha (increased leach pad production because of injection leaching), offset by lower output at Akyem, where lower grades and throughput resulted in a nearly 25% decline in production (~75,000 ounces vs. ~99,000 ounces). And although Merian reported much higher throughput in the period at ~3.7 million tonnes, production was lower here as well by ~4% due to lower grades and recoveries. Lastly, from a gold-equivalent ounce [GEO] standpoint, the drop-off was even more severe (down 82% year-over-year) given that the only co-product output came from Boddington with Penasquito temporarily offline. The result is that Newmont has reeled in its previous production guidance of 6.0 million ounces to ~5.3 million ounces of gold, with all-in sustaining cost guidance increased to $1,400/oz due to a much higher sustaining capital budget.Moving over to costs and margins, it was another high cost quarter for Newmont, with all-in sustaining costs of $1,426/oz (+12% year-over-year), which can partially be explained by a weaker than planned quarter at Ahafo, no contribution from Penasquito which is one of its lower-cost mines (FY2022 costs of ~$1,000/oz), and higher sustaining capital spend in the period ($336 million vs. $258 million). Fortunately, these higher costs were offset by a stronger average realized gold price and Newmont was able to report a 17% increase in AISC margins to $494/oz. That said, the company was up against its easiest comparisons in years with this being the weakest quarter for margins since Q4 2019. Hence, while the margin was recovery was positive, it was less of a recovery than I had hoped and costs at Penasquito won't be any cheaper going forward with a further wage increase for union workers.If we dig into the bigger picture, costs are sitting at $1,425/oz year-to-date ($1,209/oz in same period of 2022), and Newmont is now guiding for ~$200/oz higher AISC than its previous outlook of ~$1,200/oz. However, while this might seem alarming, it's worth noting that this is due to an increase in its sustaining capital budget for 2023 to $1.4 billion (previously $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion), with five new autonomous haul tracks purchased at Boddington, camp upgrades at Musselwhite, and a replacement conveyor at Ahafo. This has been offset by lower than planned growth capital due to less spending on Yanacocha Sulfides and delayed timing of spending at Tanami due to the rainfall event, with full-year capex still expected to come in near ~$2.5 billion. So, while the full-year AISC might appear disappointing, I would expect a meaningful improvement in costs with this largely a function of higher sustaining capital, and one-time headwinds, and with the benefit of Newcrest's lower-cost assets that will contribute a full year of production in 2024.Finally, looking at Newmont's financial results, the company generated ~$1.01 billion in operating cash flow helped by favorable working capital changes and generated ~$397 million in free cash flow despite higher capital expenditures in the period (~$604 million). This was a meaningful improvement from limited free cash flow generation in H1 and a free cash outflow of $63 million in Q3 2022. That said, the quarter was mediocre overall in my view and while the company will look very different with the addition of lower-cost assets added to the portfolio once the Newcrest deal closes in early November, the meaningful wage increase to turn Penasquito back online is not ideal especially with headwinds from a stronger Mexican Peso, nor is the softer production over the next couple of quarters from Ahafo vs. my previous expectations, with this asset now likely to produce closer to ~700,000 ounces vs. what should have been a ~800,000 ounce year previously.Although Newmont's year-to-date results have been disappointing, investors certainly have reason to be excited about the approval of the Newcrest merger by shareholders which will transform the company and add ~2.15 million ounces of attributable gold production per annum with the bulk of this coming from Tier-1 ranked jurisdictions and lower cost assets. In addition, Newmont will also add significant copper production (FY2024 production of ~130,000 tonnes based on Newcrest's guidance) assuming none of Newcrest's assets are divested. That said, Newmont did note that there will be re-sequencing of projects in the portfolio and that portfolio optimization proceeds from the divestment of assets will go to strengthening the balance sheet, suggesting that some portfolio optimization within the first 18 months post-closing looks likely.Overall, the amalgamation of Newmont and Newcrest will give Newmont a much larger leader on the #2 and #3 gold producers in the sector, with its total production set to be in line with its two closest peers production profiles  at ~8.0 million ounces vs. ~7.8 million ounces. Meanwhile, Newmont will see improved diversification, enjoy a significant improvement in its margin profile with the addition of lower-cost assets like Cadia and Brucejack, and could ultimately see much lower all-in sustaining costs if it approves the Red Chris Block Cave which is expected to carry negative AISC. Finally, Newmont shared that it plans to put its Full Asset Potential program to work at Cadia and Lihir (similar to how it put its own mark on Penasquito and significantly improved the asset), suggesting that there could be better days for Lihir under Newmont if it can be optimized (currently a massive producer, but higher-cost). To summarize, while the year-to-date and Q3 results were nothing to write home about, patient investors should be rewarded here.Finally, when it comes to capital allocation, Newmont shared that following potential portfolio optimization, it could look at buying back shares if its currency continues to be attractively valued and this would certainly help to claw back some of the expected dilution from the Newcrest deal. This is similar to what Newmont did following the Goldcorp deal and it was certainly received well by the market (~$500 million in share repurchases in 2019), with NEM outperforming the GDX massively following the deal and hitting a new multi-year high vs. the GDX from a relative strength standpoint. Plus, one could argue that the Goldcorp was more opportunistic vs. this deal being more strategic (higher-quality assets even if paying a higher price), so investors should be more comfy with the current deal and this contributing to a better portfolio overall vs. the Goldcorp deal where the best contributors were Penasquito, 40% of Pueblo Viejo and Cerro Negro, offset by some more marginal assets.Newmont had a softer Q3 year-over-year than I hoped even adjusting for the interruption to operations at Penasquito, but its financial results were helped by being up against easy year-over-year comps with a lower gold price in Q3 2022. And while Penasquito is back online, the wage increase isn't ideal when combined with a stronger Mexican Peso from a cost standpoint, though there certainly weren't many alternatives other than selling the asset and it at least drove a hard bargain to not cave to the initial demands. On a positive note, the company is just over a week away from closing its transformative Newcrest acquisition, and investors will get their first look at the new Newmont in the next quarterly report with seven weeks of operations from the combined portfolio expected in Q4. So, with Newmont 2.0 being much stronger and what I trust will be a much better portfolio post-2025 following portfolio optimization with much stronger free cash flow generation, I would view sharp pullbacks on NEM as buying opportunities.

And welcome to the Ethan Allen Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Analyst Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]Please note this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Matt McNulty, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.Thank you, Doug. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today to discuss Ethan Allen’s fiscal 2024 first quarter results. With me today is Farooq Kathwari, our Chairman, President and CEO. Mr. Kathwari will open and close our prepared remarks, while I will speak to our financial performance midway through. After our prepared remarks, we will then open the call for your questions.Before we begin, I’d like to remind the audience that this call is being recorded and webcast live under the News and Events tab on the Investor Relations page of our website.There, you will find a copy of our press release, which contains reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures referred to on this call and in this press release. A replay of today’s call will also be made available on our Investor Relations website.Our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. The most significant risk factors that could affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete review of those risks. The company assumes noWith that, I am pleased to now turn the call over to Mr. Kathwari.Thank you, Matt, and good to have you join our call to review our first fiscal 2024 results and our initiatives. AsWe are positioned well. We have continued to strengthen our vertically integrated enterprise. We have also continued to maintain a strong cash balance. During the quarter, we distributed $0.36 of regular and $0.50 of special dividend, and we also yesterday announced a regular dividend of $0.36 in addition to these two.After Matt provides a brief overview of our financial results, I will discuss our various initiatives in growing and growing our business by positioning us as an interior design destination, strengthening our talent, marketing, manufacturing, logistics and our unique retail network providing interior design service increasingly combined with technology. Matt?Thank you, Mr. Kathwari. As a reminder, we present our financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP results exclude restructuring initiatives, impairments, unusual or infrequently occurring events such as Vermont flood and other corporate actions. We believe the non-GAAP presentation better reflects underlying operating trends and performance of the business.Our financial results in the just completed first quarter are highlighted by strong margins, sales being impacted by July flooding at our Vermont case goods plants, positive operating cash flow, the payment of a special cash dividend and a robust balance sheet. Despite operating in a softening economy, our operations produced positive financial results, which I will now discuss.Our consolidated net sales totaled $163.9 million, a decrease of 23.6% due to lower delivered unit volume from softening order demand, reduced manufacturing production from lower backlog, a strong comparable prior year and the impact from the Vermont flooding, which resulted in a temporary work stoppage and lowered net sales by approximately $15 million in the quarter.Our Orleans plant has since resumed operations and we expect to recover from the delayed shipments during the upcoming second and third quarters. Sales in the first quarter a year ago set a near record pace as we work through historically high backlog, leading to a difficult comparison.From a demand perspective, we are back to more normal conditions, down from the high demand we experienced during the height of the pandemic. Wholesale segment written orders decreased 15.6% compared to last year, while retail segment written orders were down 13.2%.We ended the quarter with wholesale backlog of $75.4 million, down 28.6% from a year ago, but up $1.4 million since June 30, 2023, due to the timing of contract business orders combined with production levels being impacted by the Vermont flood.The number of weeks of backlog as of September 30, 2023, was down compared to last year with notable improvement seen within upholstery and home accent. Our wholesale backlog is approaching pre-pandemic levels as our teams are managing the business to service our customers.Consolidated gross margin was 61.1%, our 10th consecutive quarter that consolidated gross margin exceeded 58%. When compared to last year, our consolidated gross margin was up 70 basis points due to favorable product mix, lower input costs, investments in technology and reduced headcount, partially offset by lower delivered unit volume and a change in sales mix.Retail sales were 81.5% of consolidated sales, down 80 -- down from 85.6% last year as we delivered out more wholesale backlog, including a greater percentage of contract business.Adjusted operating margin was 12.1%, down from 17.6% last year, primarily from lower sales. These costs were partially offset by gross margin expansion, lower headcount and the company’s ability to maintain a disciplined approach to cost savings and expense control.Our SG&A expenses decreased 12.7% and equaled 49% of sales, up from 42.9% last year from fixed cost deleveraging. As previously stated, in July 2023, our wood furniture manufacturing operations located in Orleans, Vermont sustained damage from flooding. In addition to losses related to inventory and state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment, the flooding also resulted in a temporary work stoppage for many associates and a disruption and delay of shipments.The growth financial loss incurred from the disposal of inventory, inoperable machinery equipment from water damage, facility cleanup and restoration amounted to $3.6 million and after insurance proceeds of $1 million and a grant from the State of Vermont a $500,000, the net amount of the pretax loss was $2.1 million and was reported within restructuring and other charges and it’s excluded from our adjusted earnings.Adjusted EPS was $0.63, compared with $1.11 last year. For historical context, our adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $0.35. Our effective tax rate was 25.6%, which is comparable to 25.3% a year ago.Now turning to our liquidity and capital resources. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including cash and investments of $163.2 million and no outstanding debt. We generated $16.7 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, which was driven by strong profits. Our inventory levels decreased $18 million from a year ago as we restore our operating inventory levels to more historical norms as backlog decreases.We continued our practice of returning capital to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. In August, our Board declared a special cash dividend of $0.50 per share in addition to our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, both of which were paid on August 31st. We have now paid a special dividend in each of the past three years. Also as just announced yesterday, our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, which will be paid in November.In summary, our vertically integrated business was able to produce a double-digit operating margin during a period marked by industry-wide softer demand and a temporary work stoppage at our Vermont plant that led to lower sales.We generated $16.7 million in positive cash flow and protected our margins through disciplined investments and a strong expense management. We will continue to carefully manage our expense structure.With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kathwari.Well, thanks, Matt. As you know, we have had our interior design focus for decades. However, the recent focus, our initiative under the umbrella of interior design destination takes our business to an entirely different level. This includes the following impacts.Repositioning of the Interior of our design centers with strong and consistent programs across the entire network. We launched this concept in our Danbury Design Center in April of this year and have recently started launching in our design centers across North America and internationally.Recently, we had ribbon cuttings in 16 locations, just to give you perspective, including having this enhanced projection in Manhattan, New York; in Albany, New York; in Cordova, Tennessee; Plaistow, New Hampshire; Marlton, New Jersey; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Garden City, Long Island; Westchester, New York; Mount Pleasant, South Carolina; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Peachtree City, Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; Princeton, New Jersey and Setauket, Long Island.This week actually just now we are in the process of having grand openings in Kennesaw, Georgia that is near Atlanta; San Francisco, California; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Birmingham, Alabama.Our objective is to continue implementing this in our 174 design center locations in North America. Next 30 days, 67 are scheduled and in December 27 and by end of December 114 of the design centers have -- will have been repositioned with this -- the products and the attitude.The initiative has many benefits, including consistent projections across North America, continued strengthening of our Interior Design associates, consistent marketing across North America, strengthened and motivated interior designers and clients, consisting -- consistency in offering across North America helps improve service and gross and operating margins.After amazing focus of consumers in their homes during the COVID pandemic, we see consumers have spent more time and focus in other areas such as travel. We expect to see that that moderate and more focus on home, although not at the level we saw during the COVID period.We continue to see reduction of costs such as in raw materials, energy and transportation. While we have developed very strong new products during the last two years to three years, we decided to hold off introducing during the COVID period. We have now started introducing new products and will continue to do so in the next 12 months.During the last three years, despite high demand, we continue to strengthen and streamline our operations, including strengthening our Interior Design teams and our design centers. Today, we have about 30% less interior design professionals who are about to do the same business. In fact from 2019, our total head cost -- headcount in the -- in our company is less by 21%.By using technology and whether it is in our manufacturing, whether it is in our retail, especially in retail and in our logistics, has helped us make our interior designers more proficient and as they say, is a game changer.Now we have strengthened our talent and unfortunate recent bankruptcies of furniture retailers has brought us also new and experienced talent. Our manufacturing also has continued to benefit from strong teams and use of technology. Keep in mind that 75% of all our products are made in our North American operations and 75% of the products are made custom when we receive the order.So we are in a good position and I know that we are, we have some challenges because of the economy and but we are positioned well and we are stronger both in terms of people, in terms of our offerings and our facilities.And with that, I’d like to open it up for any questions and comments.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Water Tower Research. Please proceed with your question.Good afternoon, Farooq and Matt.Budd, Budd, Budd, just a second. It’s Budd -- it’s Budd Bugatch and Budd Bugatch, you have been covering us when I was -- since I have been 15 years old. So, how are you, Budd?I -- probably since I was 15 too, Farooq, but that’s fine. Thank you. Congratulations on the margin performance and what is it got to be, it’s a very challenging environment. And I do have a few questions and I am trying to just project forward. As you look at the volume and going forward, you noted that your deposits are down about 29% year-over-year as customer deposits and that would be at retail. So I am thinking and you did a pretty good job of less -- you were less down in orders for the retail than you were in actual net sales. So I suspect it for the second quarter retail sales will be down year-over-year, but probably, somewhat lower than what we saw in the first quarter, lower than the 20 -- less than a 24% -- 27% for retail, pardon me?Yeah. It’s a little bit early, Budd. But I think that your comments are good comments in the sense that while we have reduced our backlogs to a great degree, but still keep in mind as I said, our backlog is now down and because -- is down because we delivered, were down by about 27% and 28% or so at our wholesale, 27% at retail.So we generated a lot of backlog. We still have reasonably good backlog. We are still -- backlog is when you go back to pre-COVID when, for instance, our backlog is still about 20% higher than it was in 2019.So we have a decent backlog, not as what we had last year, but that backlog still gives us an opportunity to continue to ship products and we are also expecting hopefully, hope is not a method, but we are expecting that consumer’s attitudes, as I mentioned, are going to somewhat go back into the home after the last -- in the last three months or four months, they have spent a tremendous amount of time in travel and other areas.I understand that. And you did note that the retail orders were down 13% year-over-year and I will ask the obligatory, how that proceed during the quarter, what was those comparisons looks like as the quarter progressed?You are talking of this last -- the first quarter?Yes, sir. Yeah.Okay.It was 13% was for the entire quarter for…Yeah. I’d say, it…… smaller trend [ph]It was about consistently more or less the same.Okay. And for me to just one thing on the margin performance, which is notable that 61%. Can you kind of give us any, I know you don’t disclose that, but give us a flavor of how that compared retail versus wholesale. I know you had the issue in the Orleans plant. So I am just curious as to how that proceeded?Matt, do we give those margins or what our gross?In our break out, gross margins on our retail and wholesale perspective, we do on an operating margin.Budd, generally, I would say this that, if you take out this question of what happened in Orleans, but again what happens in Orleans was considered as extraordinary. I think, that on the basis of our operations, we have been consistent both in our wholesale margins and retail margins.Okay. And last from me on the inventory, it’s down, I think, what was it, about 11% year-over-year. How does that compare retail, again, retail versus wholesale?It’s approximately, let me just see. Matt, do you have that information?Inventory is down 11% from last year.Yeah. No. He says inventory is down.I think, down, it would be more down on the wholesale side versus the retail side. As Mr. Kathwari pointed out, we do have new product that’s coming out on the floor of our design centers. So the retail inventory was a little bit higher compared to a year ago versus the big -- the bigger decrease with that wholesale.Yeah. About 11% or so down, Budd.Okay. Thank you and good luck for the balance of this year and on to next.Thanks. Thanks, Budd.Our next question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.Hello, Cristina.Hi. Hi. Good afternoon, Farooq and Matt. I wanted to ask about the SG&A expenses in the quarter. I know they declined 13%, but obviously significant deleverage on the sales decline. So, what -- I guess what I wanted to know, was there anything one-time or related to the store refreshes in the initiative that was incremental this quarter in, it’s the 12% operating margin like a new level that we should think about the next couple of quarters given the macro and the refreshes in the stores or can it get back to a little bit higher level like what you have seen in the past couple of quarters?It’s a good question, Cristina that at this stage, it’s very hard to say, because the good news is that, we are operating much more efficiently both at the manufacturing level and at the retail level.At -- when I talked about the decrease in our associates, it has taken place in all levels, and especially, with the use of technology. It’s amazing how the technology has helped us, especially at retail where our interior designers today are about 30% less than what we had just a few years back, writing more business because of the combination of technology and their personal self.And of course, this was also a tremendously important in the COVID where many, many people who are working with them from their homes. So, I think that from our perspective, it is more or less, I would say, consistent between the two major areas of our business, wholesale and retail.Maybe ask another way, is there room to cut expenses more or is that kind of $80 million you saw this quarter sort of like a slow, if you can go on the expense side?Well, it’s a good question, because when we went from $92 million that we had in the previous year quarter to $80 million, that’s a pretty major decline in from a year-to-year. So I think that we always keep on taking a look at what needs to be done, but there’s always a possibility.We are always looking at the opportunities. And again as I said, the combination of technology and personal service in our manufacturing, in our retail, in our logistics is tremendously important. So there is a possibility, but I think we have cut down it quite a bit.Okay. And then I wanted to see if you can share more color on the demand side. What you are seeing from your -- from the design centers that feedback you are getting. It seems like the consumer took another step down this quarter. Maybe any more color on the behavior you are seeing, how is it changing relative two months, three months, four months ago or earlier this year?I think that consumers that, if you take a look at it right now, they are still somewhat very conservative. I think that we are expecting that will remain for the next few months and again it is the question of how, what we are comparing it to. Comparing it to last year was -- it’s a very tough comparison, but if you compare it to, for instance, going back to pre-COVID, you can see the differences that we are starting to.We are actually higher than the pre-COVID in both at our retail business, our wholesale business and I would think this that consumers are and we are looking to see the consumers somewhat get back into furnishing their homes. They have already done a lot of it. I think they spent a fair amount of time in travel and other areas and so we would say that certainly coming into this quarter and the next quarter, we should have more consumers and more interest in the home.Thank you and good luck this quarter.Okay. Thanks very much.Our next question comes from the line of Zach Donnelly with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.Hello, Zach.Hey, Farooq. Hey, Matt. Thank you for taking our questions. I know Matt had mentioned earlier that you don’t break out gross margins based on retail or wholesale segment, but in the Q, it’s kind of noticed that you had mentioned that gross margins were unchanged year-over-year for the retail segment. And so I was wondering -- I am assuming you are seeing some form of favorable product mix on that end, favorable input costs, but notice that the clearance sales were higher. So I was wondering if you could kind of bridge that for us or maybe help us understand what impact elevated clearance has had on gross margins on the retail segment?Yeah. That’s a good question because of the fact that, we did a number of initiatives. One was of course that after we did the Danbury Design Center with great projection, of course, I think, you saw that, we also had it in Manhattan and now we are launching it all over the country.What it has done is this, it has done a great job of having very strong projection in all our design centers, but it also created some products that had to be sold clearance. So that is and that clearance as we sold at a lower margin, so that affected our gross margins.The other thing we did, which I think we haven’t -- may not have mentioned too much is that, the size of our design centers has -- is going to change. It’s already changing. Keep in mind, Manhattan for instance, we for 30 years or so were in a 30,000-square-feet location and we went to 7000 square feet.In many, many areas of the country, we are going to 7000 square feet, 8000 square feet, 10,000 square feet and what we also did starting in Danbury when we repositioned Danbury, which was a 20,000 square-foot design center, we said anything over 12,000 square-foot will not be part of a regular design center.So we created space so products have to be sold and that product was sold at lower margins. They all good products. It did two things that certainly give us business, brought in customers, but it also in the short-term did sell products at a lower margin.But as we get out of those, we will have a greater benefit of having less products on the floors, because today, I also mentioned that almost 75% of the products that we sell is a combination of interior design and technology. 25 years back, we sold whatever we showed on the floors. That’s why we are 20,000 square-foot and 30,000 square-foot design centers.All of that has had a tremendous impact, but as we go forward, I think, it will take us another six months or so to sell off this excess products that we had all in all these design centers in the country. The good news is as we move forward, we will have smaller design centers and much more efficient.Got it. That’s really helpful. Thank you, Farooq. And kind of piggybacking off of that just really honing in on retail segment gross margins, something we have been kind of tracking really closely maybe over the past month or so is just credit delinquencies and kind of financing for big ticket for discretionary items?Yeah.We have noticed over the past two quarters, you have kind of called out increased financing costs as an impact to retail gross margins. I was just wondering, could you -- do you have any sense of what percent of your retail sales are financed versus non-finance? And then on that end, can you provide any color on what you are seeing in terms of interest rates associated with that?Yeah. That’s a good question because interest rates on financing has gone up quite a bit and we were offering until two months back 24 months free interest, I mean, loans with a free interest for 12 months to 24 months…24 months.… 24 months and we said, no, that was too much. And even though we realize that was probably close to 15% to 20% of our business was done with that -- with those loans, we took it down to 12 months and instead of 24 months and because I think the interest rates went up from 3% to close about 5%, 6%. So I think as we go forward, what we feel is that still there are people who need financing, but we believe that 12 months is sufficient.Now, we have to be careful that, we don’t want to lose business. So we are going to watch very, very carefully, but at this stage, we have taken down from 24 months to 12 months, which has an impact of about, as I said, the impact on the margins, that the interest has gone from 5% to 3% or so.Got it. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. That makes sense to us. And then, I guess, my last question just kind of just on wholesale in order trends and just breaking those out. We kind of noticed that in terms of contract orders, you were down about 18% year-over-year this quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe touch on what sort of impact is that or if there is any sort of timing shift that’s impacted that where maybe the GSA is pushing out orders later potentially into fiscal 2Q for you and just how to think about that maybe moving into the next quarter, that would be really helpful?You have actually answered most of the question yourself. It is. The GSA used to have a cut off at the end of the government’s fiscal year that is September 30th, that all orders had to be put in. But this year, I don’t know if they will do the next year, they have allowed them to enter orders after the end of the fiscal year.So that way what it’s done is, it’s created sort of lower orders in September, because not everybody didn’t have to put it in. So they are now going to put this in this quarter. So I -- we believe from what we hear is that the orders that didn’t come in, in September, they will come in this quarter and that’s been the one major factor.The other is, if we talk of wholesale, obviously, when our retail business is lower, it does affect our wholesale orders and most majority of our wholesale is from our own retail division. But when you asked about the question of the government, yes, the government business has been lower and that outside business that you referred to that’s non-retail was impacted by this decision by the State Department and the GSA that to not enter all the orders in September.Got it. Got it. That’s really helpful. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on that as a final point maybe. So with that being the case moving into fiscal 2Q as we kind of see that timing shift maybe benefit written orders in 2Q. I also believe that fiscal 2Q of the prior year, your contract orders were down maybe around 88%, so just easier comparisons, moving into the next quarter, the benefit of the timing shift. Would it be fair to assume that we should see some sort of sequential improvement in written order trends on the contract side moving into the next quarter?Yeah. I think that we can make that assumption because and that the government has something different, but we are expecting that. And the retail of course will depend upon how the -- how our retail network works, how the economy is. We are -- I think we are -- our people are very motivated.This initiative of Interior Design Destination is creating a lot of impact, because at this time if we didn’t do it because of the fact that we are going to end into this soft economy, we did it was the right thing to do.But this has given us a great opportunity to get our message across -- around at a time when the only message that is being given out is that of deep discounts and going out of business. So we are getting the message across that we are alive, well and very strong in our offerings. I think that is going to help us.Got it. Yeah. That’s it for us. Thank you, Farooq. Good luck on the refresh and congrats on the strong margins this quarter. Thank you.Thanks very much. Any other questions…There are no…… or comment?There are no further questions in the queue. I’d like to hand it back to Mr. Kathwari for closing remarks.Well, thank you very much and thank you for participating and attending. And as Budd knows this is most likely, I think, over 120th, 125th consecutive quarterly call and we are just getting started. So stay with us and we got a lot of, lot of good things happening. So thanks very much for participating.Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

"Adderall shortage prompts FDA, DEA to ask for production boost","Amid an on-going shortage of the ADHD drug Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts), the US FDA and DEA are asking manufacturers to step up production.The nationwide shortage has been happening since at least October 2022 when According to an Aug. 1 letter from the heads of the FDA and DEA, the agencies ""have called on manufacturers to confirm they are working to increase production to meet their allotted quota amount.""Because Adderall is a controlled substance and has potential for abuse, there are limits to how much of the drug companies can produce. However, the letter states that in 2022, drugmakers sold 70% of their permitted quota, meaning that 1B additional doses could have been made.The FDA and DEA noted that current trends indicate pharma companies won't reach quotas for 2023 either.""If any individual manufacturer does not wish to increase production, we have asked that manufacturer to relinquish their remaining 2023 quota allotment,"" the . ""This would allow DEA to redistribute that allotment to manufacturers that will increase production.""According to an , ""Teva () is manufacturing and distributing consistent with historic levels. We continue to see unprecedented demand."" Sandoz says that they have availability for all their dosage strengths. Other companies that aren't publicly traded are indicating a shortage of active ingredients.",17,2023-08-01T14:30:32.000-04:00
Hurco Sees Another Downturn In Orders As Manufacturers Batten Down The Hatches,"I’ve said many times over the years that calling a turn in any economic cycle isn’t exactly easy, as it’s not uncommon to see a few “false dawns”. That’s even more true with a company like  (Such would seem to be the case again this quarter. While fiscal second quarter results were better than  and included a nice sequential uptick in orders, fiscal third quarter results were significantly weaker (particularly in orders), and management called out softening markets almost across the board and a need to focus on reducing inventories, generating more cash, and realigning production to apparent near-term demand.Macro indicators likeReported financials for the fiscal third quarter weren’t too bad, nor much different than my expectations (gross margin was actually better), but orders were very weak and management warned about significant weakness across major end-markets, as well as the need to reduce inventories and readjust production in light of weakening demand.Revenue declined about 9% year over year in constant currency terms and about 1% sequentially. Sales in North America declined 23% yoy and came in flat sequentially, while sales in Europe rose 6% yoy and 4% qoq with stronger sales in France and Italy offsetting weaker results in Germany and the U.K. I thought it was notable that the company also pointed to strength in the Milltronics business, a business that focuses on lower-ASP products. Business was very weak in the Asia-Pacific region – down 21% yoy and 31% qoq.Gross margin actually improved 30bp yoy and almost two points qoq to 25.3%. Operating income declined about 42% from the year-ago period and came in about flat sequentially, with the operating margin down 110bp yoy and up 10bp qoq to 1.9%.Orders declined 22% yoy in constant currency terms and 30% qoq in reported terms, driving the book-to-bill to 0.79 from 1.1 in the prior quarter. Orders were weak everywhere, with North American orders down 33% yoy and 35% qoq (B2B of 0.8), European orders down 10% yoy and 16% qoq (B2B of 0.79), and Asia-Pacific orders down 43% yoy and 46% qoq (B2B of 0.71).Inventories increased about $3M sequentially on a <$1M decline in revenueI feel as though there’s been a growing divergence between macro indicators and corporate sentiment as 2023 has developed. I’ve been expecting a mild recession starting in the second half of 2023 (or around now, in other words), but while there were meaningful declines in orders and backlogs for many industrial companies in the calendar second quarter, guidance was still relatively upbeat.Looking at manufacturing PMIs, pretty much every market of consequence is now below 50 (meaning contraction). The last two U.S. PMI readings were 47.9 in August and 49 in July, while Germany saw 39.9 in August after 38.8 in July and 41.0 in June; the July reading being the third-worst result in 15 years (the two worse readings occurred during the global financial crisis and the pandemic). In Italy, the numbers have hovered in the mid-40s for five months now, though the last two months have seen sequential increases, while the UK’s number has been below 50 for some time now and August’s 43 reading was the worst since May of 2020.Not surprisingly, other metrics of business activity aren’t any better. U.S. machine tool orders declined 2% yoy in June (the July release is due shortly) after a 17% decline in May, and the release noted even weaker numbers for job shops – the sort of small-to-medium businesses that make up a large part of Hurco’s business (unlike , , and , Hurco doesn’t do that much business with large multinationals).Up-to-date data for Germany is harder to get, but orders were down 11% in the second quarter and the August PMI release noted a sharp drop in new orders (the steepest decline since the pandemic). Likewise, the Japan Machine Builders Trade Association (or JMBTA) reported a 17% yoy decline in orders coming from outside Japan, including a 31% decline in orders from Asia, a 5% decline from North America, and a 3% decline from Europe, with sharper declines from Italy (down 9%), Germany (down 11%), and the UK (down 31%).I could go on, talking about recent trends in manufacturing sales at  () and commentary from short-cycle metalworking companies, but I think I’ve gotten the main point across – just about anywhere I look, the numbers are not encouraging.I’d love to have a definitive answer as to how much worse it will get for Hurco, but as I said in the open (and many times in prior articles over the years), this company’s size and different product and customer profile makes it harder to benchmark to these macro indicators. Said differently, I’m expecting a few more “bumping along the bottom” quarters and while I do think Hurco’s business could turn up before the macro indicators flip, I also still think there’s a risk of an even uglier quarter or two before then.I’ve taken what I hope will prove to be a conservative route with modeling, lowering my FY’23 and FY’24 revenue estimates again. I haven’t changed my FY’25 and beyond numbers as much, as my current thinking is that the timing of the downturn/recovery process has changed more than the magnitude. With that, I still think Hurco offers some leverage to ongoing reshoring efforts on the other side of this downturn, and I’d also note that U.S. and EU companies have been underinvesting in capex for some time; I believe with the renewed emphasis on shorter, more secure supply and production lines some of that underinvestment will reverse and machine tool companies like Hurco will benefit.With weaker near-term revenue and a stated goal of running down inventories and adjusting production levels, I expect weaker gross margins over the next few quarters, but my longer-term outlook hasn’t changed.All of that works out to a long-term revenue growth rate of around 2% (unchanged from before), but a mid-teens three-year growth rate off of my FY’23 estimate. My long-term FCF margins likewise don’t change that much – I expect peaks in the high-single digits and a long-term average on the low end of the mid-single digits (around 4%).Between discounted cash flow and margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA I believe Hurco shares are still undervalued and offer double-digit upside from here (with a 12-month fair value in the mid-to-high $20’s). The shares of industrials like Hurco will often move a couple of quarters ahead of turns in the actual reported financials (the market bids them up in anticipation of the turn), but I do still see a lot of uncertainty out there so that upturn doesn’t seem likely until the first half of calendar 2024 unless these macro indicators suddenly turn.Is a Hurco a good play on that eventual short-cycle turnaround? I think the upside potential is there, but the risk is still elevated and this isn’t an easy stock to own. More aggressive investors looking to make early plays on a rebound cycle should take a look, but this isn’t exactly a “sleep well at night” type of stock.

The Bullish Calumet Specialty Products' Chart (Technical Analysis),"The September quarter just closed, leaving Calumet Specialty Products () investors with an interesting quandary, which way does the price head now? In our view, it's higher, maybe much higher. In the past, Beginning with a day chart created using TradeStation Securities, investors must take careful note of the price action in the upper right-hand corner. The price drifts slowly lower on decreasing volume after a strong upward move.The slightly lower action on falling volume, signals a very bullish pattern, a . TheBefore continuing, a short summary of Calumet's business follows. It consists of three primary entities: Specialty, Performance Brands and Montana Renewables (MRL). Specialty includes fuels and high-margin products. We are anticipating an accounting change for MRL in the September quarter, this business being split into renewables and asphalt/fuels.Two important fundamentals support a coming strong response. The first is from continued relatively strong crack spreads. Investors can gain a sense of any unreported quarters using the $30 million per quarter delta for each $10 change in crack spreads by comparing the spreads in the last quarter to this quarter, followed by adding the last quarter's result. For the September quarter, the Gulf Coast 2-1-1 spread averaged $36. Remember, management hedged half of the Specialty fuel at $29. The September average with the hedge included equaled $32.5. For the June quarter without the weather loss of $20 million generated $80 million in EBITDA with the Gulf Coast spread averaging $30. Specialty might hit $90 million, approximately $10 million more for the September quarter. The 3rd quarter of the year is generally strong, like June for Performance Brands. We expect a similar result for September at $12.5 million.MRL results are more difficult. Management announced that a heat exchanger on one of the units failed, dropping renewable production to 8000 barrels per day for the last two months of the quarter. In our , we estimated September MRL at $45 million for renewables and $30-$40 million for the old fossil fuel business. With full operations at renewables, the EBITDA begins at $65 million per quarter.Our total September estimate equals $90+ million for Specialty, $12.5 million for Performance Brands, $45 million for renewables, $40 million for the old business, and a negative -$20 million for overheads netting approximately $165 million.The second price mover, the more important short-term announcement, is management's signaling that the renewables repair was complete, bringing the unit back to full operation. If past management practices hold, expect an announcement on this issue by the middle of October. In our view, the chart lettering spells higher prices on significantly higher volume. The flag suggests strongly this is coming. We shall see.In our view, the biggest risk for higher prices is a delayed heat exchanger repair at MRL. Other risks do exists but again, in our view, the biggest is a delayed repair. Regardless, the other businesses are still performing exceptionally, and a repair is coming. With a positive announcement on MRL relieving investor concerns about its operation, the market seems poised to head higher, possibly even significantly higher. The chart readers announce a resounding yes. It is simply a matter of news, news most likely to come, soon. We rate the units a strong buy.  This company is our second-largest position.

Permian Basin Royalty Trust Remains A Sell Because Production Gains Have Slowed,"Permian Basin Royalty Trust () has dropped more than 20% since my April sell recommendation , and I still consider it a sell. Production at the Waddell Ranch has been somewhat disappointing given very high capex overThis is an update to my April 19 article on Permian Basin Royalty Trust, which is approximately 87% oil and 13% natural gas based on the latest quarterly revenue figures. My focus will be mostly on the Waddell Ranch, whichBecause monthly capex has often been greater than the monthly net profit interest, there have been no distributions from Waddell Ranch in the last few years. The very modest PBT distributions have been from Texas Royalty Properties. With higher energy prices and higher production, the Waddell Ranch results from July produced a net profit interest - NPI of $1,548,797, which reduced the cumulative deficit to $(213,227).Going forward, in order to produce an NPI that enables a ""normalized"" monthly distribution from Waddell Ranch, production has to increase, oil/gas prices have to increase, capex has to decrease, or some combination of these factors. PBT investors might be able to make some rational near-term estimates for production and prices, but capex is a big unknown. What are privately held Blackbeard Operating's capex plans for next year and the year after? We don't know.According to the  distribution press release, the planned capex for 2023 was going to be $135 million (net to the trust) with a ""projection of about 55.5 new drill wells and 45 recompletions along with about 37.5 plug and abandoned wells."" That was reduced to $122 million and 48.75 wells in the  press release and further reduced to $96.8 million and 30.75 new wells in the  release. According to that press release: ""This revision of the previously announced budget is the result of reviewing the current and future activity of the industrial environment of the Waddell Ranch."" It's unclear if these changes were made because the other wells no longer were expected to be profitable, or they were just deferring the planned drilling to sometime in the future.PBT investors have to remember that Blackbeard Operating has no fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for PBT investors. The trust only has a 75% net overriding royalty interest in Waddell Ranch. I assume that Blackbeard hedged some of the current production at much higher oil/gas prices last year and is, therefore, making a very large profit. Because the trust can't hedge, PBT investors are not. The question remains: When is Blackbeard going to reduce capex? When do energy prices drop? When drilling and workovers are no longer producing profitable results for this mature field? We don't know. Usually, capex plans are announced in monthly distribution press releases in January or February for that year.A major factor in capex decisions is actual recent results. I was able to find some recent information in a non-subscription source (copyright issues), , for Blackbeard Operating in a different field in Texas that was rather disappointing:Since this is not for Waddell Ranch or even in Crane County, it may not be indicative of the capex decision-making process for Waddell Ranch. It does, however, raise some concerns about their ability to select capex projects, in my opinion.The  monthly distribution payable on Oct. 16 is $0.022414 per unit, which is from Texas Royalty Properties only because Waddell Ranch still has a deficit.  (total NPI of $12,228,596). For the sake of discussion, annualize this $0.26 monthly amount to get a total annual distribution of $3.12, which implies PBT is trading with a 14.7% yield using the latest $21.25 PBT price. With an annual distribution of $3.12 and a yield of 8%, PBT would trade at $39. The reality is that with no capex, oil/gas production would drop significantly going forward and so would the distributions. It is, however, interesting to look at.Since PBT trades on potential future distributions and the resulting yields compared to U.S. treasuries, the significantly higher yields over the last 20 months had a negative impact on PBT price. Yield changes can have a dramatic impact on PBT prices. Just for the sake of illustration, assume the annual distribution is $1.20 (also ignoring any tax impacts), with a 6% yield, PBT would trade at $20.00; and with an 8% yield, it would trade at $15. With U.S. 10-year notes currently yielding about 4.6%, the difference between a PBT yield of 8% is only 340 basis points and the difference with a two-year Treasury is only 296 basis points, which is not enough to justify the risk of owning PBT, in my opinion.Given the level of high interest rates currently and because PBT is a risky investment, I think a ""normalized"" distribution yield of at least 8.5% would be appropriate. This would imply a ""normalized"" total annual distribution of $1.80 based on the latest $21.25 PBT price. Most of my annual distribution estimates are below $1.80 using a combination of a number of different variables. At this point, the biggest wildcard remains Blackbeard's planned CAPEX next year and going forward.PBT already had a spectacular run-up in price as both energy prices and capex increased sharply. Now, reality has settled in, and it seems that the oil/gas production is beginning to level off. How much can capex decline in order to allow for a normalized monthly distribution without dramatically reducing production? I think PBT investors are caught in a trap, especially since the trust can't hedge against lower energy prices and Blackbeard can.They're currently selling the significant increase in oil/gas production from larger capex at lower prices than last year. Since I just don't see how the monthly distributions can be increased to a level that justifies the latest PBT price given the high level of interest rates, I consider PBT a sell.

TD Synnex: Wait For Better Price Levels,"TD SYNNEX () is a solutions aggregator for the IT ecosystem. Since my last , the stock hasn't moved a lot; it is trading around the same level. It recently announced its Q3 FY23 results, and I will analyze theIt recently posted its Q3 FY23 . The revenue for Q3 FY23 was $13.9 billion, a decline of 9% compared to Q3 FY22. The decline was due to revenue decline in the Americas and Europe. The revenue from the Americas and Europe declined by 10.3% and 9.7% in Q3 FY23 compared to Q3 FY22. I think both these regions were affected due to lower demand for the endpoint solutions. Its gross margin for Q3The net income for Q3 FY23 was $139.2 million, a decline of 6.4% compared to Q3 FY22. A $16 million higher interest expense affected the income. The decline in revenues might show weakness, but honestly, I think the comparison with FY22 becomes quite difficult because, in FY22, the company saw a post-pandemic boom in PC ecosystem products demand, which boosted its revenue significantly, and in FY23, it witnessed a cooldown in the post-pandemic demand. So even though the revenue declined, I think maintaining the revenue growth even at this rate is quite impressive, and with only one quarter remaining, I think FY23 revenue will be quite lower than FY22 revenue, which I believe might not be an issue because in FY23 the company didn't have post-pandemic demand tailwind. In addition, if we look at its revenue growth over the years, it has outperformed almost every competitor of its. So, even after a revenue decline in the current quarter, I think the result was decent.It is trading at $96.9 level. The stock hasn't moved much since the last report. It is around the same level as it was in July. I can see a beautiful triangle pattern here. The stock is in a triangle pattern, and the stock has faced resistance from the upper trend line and is headed towards the lower trendline. Hence, one can initiate buying when it reaches around the lower trendline, which is at $91, because the lower trendline is a great support for the stock. The other reason is that the stock is looking great for the long term because there are signs of a trend reversal, like the break of the structure of lower highs and lower lows that I mentioned in the last report. Hence, I believe one can get it at a discounted price of $91. Hence, I would advise waiting for the stock to reach the $91 level, and once it reaches that, I think one can add it for the long term.It is performing quite well and keeping up the tremendous sales growth it has seen over the previous two years. The current  also looks quite low. It has a P/E [FWD] ratio of 8.97x, which is lower than the sector ratio of 21.32x, and it is trading at a PEG of 1.07x, which is lower than the sector ratio of 1.8x. I think the company is trading at a significantly lower P/E multiple than the sectoral P/E; considering its solid financial performance and future growth estimates, I think the company should trade at a higher P/E multiple. A P/E multiple of 15x is suitable for the company, and with a non-GAAP EPS [FWD] of $10.81, it gives us a price target of $162. So, I think this stock provides a significant upside from the current level. But even though it provides a significant upside, I wouldn't recommend investing in it as I think one can get it at an even more discounted price. The technical momentum suggests a slight correction. Hence, it would be better to wait and invest in it when it reaches the support line, which is at $91. So, looking at all factors, I assign a hold rating.The company's connections with a select group of OEM suppliers are crucial to its future success. For instance, the sales of products and services by HP Inc. accounted for around 10%, 12%, and 15% of their total revenue in the fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, while the sales of products and services by Apple Inc. accounted for roughly 11% of their total revenue in the fiscal year 2022. Their OEM supplier contracts are often short-term and subject to immediate, no-fault termination. OEM supplier contracts are frequently created at the regional or national level, and these connections may change in some nations or regions but not in others. The termination or deterioration of their relationship with HP Inc., Apple Inc., or any other significant OEM supplier, the approval of additional distributors by OEM suppliers, the sale of products by OEM suppliers directly to their reseller and retail customers and end-users, or their failure to forge relationships with new OEM suppliers or to increase the distribution and supply chain services that they offer OEM suppliers could have a negative impact on their operations, finances, and reputation. Additionally, OEM suppliers can experience liquidity or solvency problems, which could severely impact their operations and financial performance.Even after a revenue decline, I think the quarterly result was decent. They are continuing on their steady upward trajectory, and I believe it provides solid upside potential in the long term. But the current momentum is suggesting a slight downside.

Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,"At the close of 2021, a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up ""in the 2020s decade,"" setting the stage for what she callsStill, in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion: a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape, and shape fortunes, throughout thisRegarding the long-term future of the energy sector, my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developments:Because of these developments, I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the Russia/Ukraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today. In my opinion, these companies, as well as their investors, would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020s.In the following sections, I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil, while also exploring how this affects one of the world's largest and most vertically integrated oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corporation ().After the forced breakup of Standard Oil, an American oil behemoth, Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company. Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world, and produces a large amount of the world's energy ( in 2018). It is vertically integrated, and therefore controls the upstream (exploration, drilling, extraction), midstream (transportation, storage, refining), and downstream (retail sales and distribution) handling of oil and natural gas. While it may not be the world's largest oil company (a title usually held by state-owned Saudi Aramco), Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry, making it significantly appealing to investors.As formidable a company as it may be, the oil giant's past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s, and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that time.Revenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the $350-400 billion range, but declined to the $200-250 billion range from 2015 to 2019. Revenues for 2020 were disastrous, with the company pulling in only $178 billion that year. However, 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over $275 billion, and in 2022, the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil, revenues of Exxon increased to nearly $400 billion, since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supply.Regarding net income, the trends are about the same, with different numbers: ~$32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014, a decline to the $15-20 billion range from 2015-2019 (with a notable drop to ~$8 billion in 2016), a disastrous decline to a loss of $22 billion in 2020, a return to form of ~$22 billion earned in 2021, and a sharp rise to ~$55 billion earned in 2022.Lastly, cash flow from operations tells a similar story: ~$45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014, a decline to the $20-30 billion range for 2015-2019, a decline to $14 billion in 2020, and a rise to $48 billion and $67 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Notwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances, Exxon's performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry. A misstep like neglecting shale shouldn't have been catastrophic for the company in any case, considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industry's operations. This means, however, that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse, there's a good chance Exxon would follow as its oil-based revenue streams unraveled.As the stock of a well-known giant in the energy sector, I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time. As I've said in previous articles, quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing, and XOM is no different.At time of writing, XOM trades at a trailing P/E ratio of ~8.7x, a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector. However, its forward P/E is 12x, ~15% above sector peers. This premium exists for XOM's P/B (price to book) and P/Cash flow as well, trading at a premium of over 25% and over 50% above the energy sector, respectively. Even though XOM's P/S (price to sales) is slightly discounted at ~10% below sector, most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey, as is expected for such a dominant oil firm.As long as the oil market remains healthy, XOM's premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the world's premier energy companies. However, a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances, ultimately devaluing XOM stock. Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM, but in my opinion, this stock might be ripe for a decline, one that is not yet priced into its stock's somewhat rich valuation multiples.As I have stated, Exxon and XOM's fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry, due to oil's overwhelming centrality to Exxon's business model. Accordingly, to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline, we must understand the reasons why the oil industry, and fossil fuels overall, are set to decline. These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article, culminating in my rating for XOM stock.To understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending, we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument: the fact that renewables are rising. Why is this happening, and why does it mean the end of oil?To start, the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history, especially in the last century or so. Technologies, chemistries, and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today. These include new ways to generate energy.Regarding renewable energy generation specifically, to make  short, scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible. Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances, different manufacturing methods, designs, and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy - more compact, energy dense batteries, greater energy absorption from solar panels, better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power, improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen, and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and more.These improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible - producing and storing as much energy as possible, for as long as possible, with the longest lifespans possible, and with the fewest materials and resources possible. As an overlooked side benefit, these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap. Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar room-sized behemoths to hundred dollar hand-sized devices, innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient, expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient, cheaper, viable mass-market energy sources.Over several decades, the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations. Now, in the 2020s, this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources (see Lazard data referenced later), i.e. fossil fuels, and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years. This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market, which I will detail later in this section.As the prices for renewables fall, renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into. A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size, and efficient enough in energy production, that smaller industrial firms, factories, power plants, businesses, and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will. This means that due to competitive pricing, high efficiency, and high scalability, renewable power generation is readily decentralized, setting it up for rapid mass adoption.This is not possible with fossil fuels, it and never will be. The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized. Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground, transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries, then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines. Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are, because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refinement, combustion, and distribution is too large for any small firm, let alone a single household, to handle in a reasonably cost-effective manner.By contrast, renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time, with no transportation or combustion necessary. Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy, and then letting the environment fill it up from there. Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales, such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicle-to-grid transference, is optional, but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent. The refinement process for renewables (i.e. converting renewable energy to electricity, switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa, switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage, etc.) is quick and highly efficient at every step. Simply put, the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuels.Even so, one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology, and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself. While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy (at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used), renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost (the one-time payment for the devices themselves) to generate power; the renewable energy produced afterward is free, and the one-time cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy produced.Renewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production, and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized, free power over centralized, pricey power production where possible. This does not bode well for oil companies, other fossil fuel companies, or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF (), Reeves Utility Income Trust (), DNP Select Income Fund (), Vanguard Utilities Index ETF (). Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fuel-dependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies, the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure. Put another way, when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free, they will rarely, if ever, need to pay for energy from utility companies.Furthermore, as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics, and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices, economies of scale will start to ramp up. High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables, which will prompt greater production of renewable devices/tech, which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale, which will prompt further cost and price declines, which will prompt greater demand, and so on. This vicious cycle (or virtuous cycle) stands in stark contrast to the oil market, where prices seem to rarely decrease for long, no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy. As demand for renewables rises, and its unique benefits become clear, demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall, as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronounced.With these market dynamics at play, renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines, and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply; meanwhile, fossil fuels will see ever-decreasing demand, and soon will not be able to compete as energy sources.For about two centuries, oil and coal were the only high-energy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries. Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them, such as nuclear power and natural gas, yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree. But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels. Natural gas itself has become  in recent years, and renewables are now competitive with, if not cheaper than, fossil fuels.According to Lazard Ltd's  of the Levelized Cost of Electricity/Energy (or ""LCOE"", essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced) for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels, most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled - without renewable subsidies, with subsidies, adjusting for fuel prices, a hypothetical carbon tax, component costs, and so on. Ultimately, Lazard's data demonstrates that renewables, which were once  back in 2009, have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan. In fact, it has been argued that renewable energy sources, specifically solar, wind, and battery storage, have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE. Regardless, the cheapness of renewable power, once added to the energy market, stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installed.Consider the example of Texas. The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century, and Texas still  of the United States' oil today. The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though, as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix, along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy. As the major producer of its most in-demand energy sources, Texas, unsurprisingly, has had some of the country's lowest energy prices over the last 50 years,  (opens in Excel).This was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home. Yet even in Texas, renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price. Based on an  of Texas's power grid with vs. without renewable energy, renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022. This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions, even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given region.All this to say, renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities, states, provinces, and countries to use to power their economies. From the  to the , from  to  to , and even in , renewables are often the go-to option for power plant buildout, since they may now be one of the less expensive options available. Furthermore, renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs, but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs .Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels, with  and  still falling, future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power, displacing some aging fossil fuel-based projects on the basis of cost alone. This will devastate oil in particular, especially in the US. Electric vehicle registrations are , and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy , both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuels.Assuming these trends persist and broaden, they will destroy most of the demand for oil, since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about  (aggregating Road, Rail, Aviation, and Industry). As these sources of demand dry up, the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normal.To round this section out, let me highlight two important points. , ""[t]he global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years,"" and ""renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity expansion"" in that same time span. Additionally, there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world, and eliminate over 99% of global carbon emissions to boot. If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world, renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide, and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then almost every nation will do so. This will allow fast-spreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector, in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable market.In short, not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables, but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world, surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations. Further, renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations' economic preferences, and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapes.But the bad news doesn't end there.As with our ability to switch to renewables, the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change: humans are , and the consequences are being felt, and measured, . If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict, it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities, nations, and whole continents. Severe storms, floods, freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace, and things are only set to worsen. Left unchecked, climate change will  and cause devastating , a one-two punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human suffering.Because of this, governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles, putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum. Some nations, such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol, acted faster than others, but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change, or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituents.Accordingly, , various pieces of European Union (""EU"") legislation and policies like the European Green Deal, and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA""), are stuffed with climate-related mandates and incentives. Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere, including tackling the root cause: fossil fuels.  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens' fossil fuel consumption.Additionally, the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climate-friendly programs and technologies much more appealing - possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuels.For instance, , much of the IRA's funding is ""designed to  in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing"" (emphasis added). In other words, IRA funding is meant to jump-start an  buying spree of renewable energy tech, as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries; this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into law.Needless to say, regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 10-15 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry, and does not set it up for a decade of success. Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements, but the long-term trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakable.To illustrate, a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry, to the  of many environmentalists; however, an  of the law by ""[t]he think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings' energy use, home electrification, and green lands set aside as carbon sinks"" (emphasis added). While the real-world ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates, the intent and impact of the law is clear: ramp up renewables, curb carbon.These legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry, and to the fossil fuel industry at large, will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade. For all intents and purposes, governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use, and their word is law.Governments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of . The US is an infamous example of this, having lavishly funded the industry . However, as renewable energy technology has evolved, governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well. , global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time, representing a 31% increase from 2021.As renewable energy investment continues trending upward, governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources, especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States. Soon, these governments will be forced to subsidize just one.Assuming they are rational in their decision, they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities (i.e., choose renewables), and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies. Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables, it will be a big financial blow to the industry, including oil firms.If cost alone doesn't make the decision for governments easy, the following consideration might force their hand.What are two things that Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have in common? They are among  in the last decade, and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations. Western nations' interests consist primarily of protecting human rights, defending global law and order, and preserving political liberalism (not to be confused with partisan liberalism). By contrast, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in, or actively opposed to, these notions.To be fair, these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters - Canada and Norway are top producers too, after all. But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests, and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world. Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other such oil-rich nations' influence and ability to cause trouble would decline. Therefore, Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective, and will pursue it as they do other national security issues.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC/OPEC+), which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels, is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit. Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations, but most nations on earth, and would diminish OPEC's influence on energy prices and global affairs. Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables, if only to free themselves from OPEC's price controls.All of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand, as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industry.As if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough, the oil industry often courts scandal and . From the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry, be it  or ,  or , the well-publicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust. This sentiment is captured in well-worn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons, and that the entire industry is led by crooks, thieves, and liars in fancy suits.More importantly, the industry's scandals and reputation, its , and the rising prices of gasoline/petrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty. These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base, and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers. This isn't all that surprising - people, especially Americans, have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back , and such disdain likely has a much longer history.What's more, oil companies don't seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty. According to , only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business. This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty. Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies, most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business, or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decade.When the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent, and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass, ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves, resulting in sudden, severe, and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuels.This is almost certainly true for Exxon, which even has an oil spill named after it. Unfortunately for Exxon, the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness; this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms, worsening its position as the energy transition kicks off.Taken together, all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil, the oil industry, and the rest of the fossil fuel industry, as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables. As such, I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry, and should strongly consider abandoning these companies, including Exxon, as long term investments.Companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time, and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recover.This includes Exxon, of course, as well as names such as Chevron Corporation (), The Phillips 66 Company (), Sempra (), ONEOK, Inc. (), OGE Energy Corp. (), Brooge Energy Ltd (), WEC Energy Group, Inc. (), White Energy Company Ltd (), Magellan Midstream Partners (), Sunoco LP (), CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (), Enbridge Inc. (), TC Energy Corporation (), TotalEnergies SE (, ), Marathon Oil Corporation (), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (), Valero Energy Corporation (), NuStar Energy LP (), Ovintiv Inc. (), Cenovus Energy Inc. (), ConocoPhillips Company (), Eni S.p.A. (, ), Plains All American Pipeline LP (), Ring Energy Inc. (), VAALCO Energy, Inc. () Occidental Petroleum Corporation (), Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (aka Petrobras) (), Pampa Energía S.A. (, ), Callon Petroleum Company (), Imperial Petroleum Inc. (), NiSource, Inc. (), Devon Energy Corporation (), Energy Transfer LP (), Ecopetrol S.A. (), Vistra Corp. (), The Williams Companies, Inc. (), Canadian Natural Resources Limited (), Koninklijke Vopak N.V. (, ), InPlay Oil Corp. (), Inpex Corporation (, ), Shell plc (, ), Dominion Energy, Inc. (), Duke Energy Corporation (), Baker Hughes Company (), Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (), APA Corporation (), Chesapeake Energy Corporation (), Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (), PBF Energy Inc. (), and many more.On the other hand, pure play renewable energy companies, and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space, have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond. These include Enel S.p.A. (, ), Ørsted A/S (, ), Iberdrola S.A. (, ), ReNew Energy Global plc (), Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd. (), Ocean Power Technologies (), Tesla Inc. (), Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. (), Brookfield Renewable (, ), Freyr Battery (), Array Technologies, Inc. (), Nano One Materials Corp. (), Novonix Ltd (, ), LiCycle Holdings Corp (), Maxeon Solar Technologies (), First Solar Inc. (), Azure Power Global Ltd (), Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A. (aka Eletrobrás) (), Acciona, S.A. (), Nextracker Inc. (), AmmPower Corp. (), Enphase Energy, Inc. (), Fluence Energy, Inc. (), and Vestas Wind Systems A/S (, ), among others. Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers, including the oil industry.As an aside, you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the ""winners"" in the energy transition, despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term. The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy, it will be the renewable energy utilities. These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers, much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuel-based energy grid today. This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future, considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy use.Nevertheless, even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand long-term as renewable energy production decentralizes, they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities, which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuel-based energy generation, a double whammy for their prospects.Like the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil, many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time; they may even have a multi-decade timespan in mind. Therefore, the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise, and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits. This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks, creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlash.This cycle will be compounded by the transformation of productive and valuable oil assets (e.g. drilling equipment, pipelines, refineries, thermal power plants, gasoline/petrol station infrastructure, etc.) into unproductive stranded assets that further damage company balance sheets across the industry. Investors who keep their faith in the industry will ignore the warning signs and may double down as this all unfolds, retaining their shares or even buying dips on the expectation of a recovery. When the dust settles, many oil investors will have lost significant sums of capital. They won't be alone, though - investors in companies across the fossil fuel industry will sustain similar losses.For Exxon Mobil, all of these negative consequences will be felt even more severely, since it is exposed to all three streams (upstream, midstream, and downstream) in the oil industry. Exxon's exposure to all three streams also makes it the likeliest to feel these consequences first, since they could appear in any one of these streams before the others. Perhaps in the medium term Exxon will be able to shift its primary operations to whichever stream seems to be declining the slowest, but the eventual collapse of all three streams will ensure that, barring an exit from the oil industry, Exxon will decline severely along with the oil industry.Meanwhile, as fossil fuel projects age, become socially or politically unpopular, or become uneconomical to operate or maintain, they will be replaced by renewables. As fossil fuel firms start to fail, renewable companies will proliferate and grow. Renewable firms will take market share and capital from the old guard, and will become the vanguard leading the energy sector. These renewable companies will then steadily increase in status, value, and market cap, and will handsomely reward investors who sent capital their way - especially the early investors.For those currently invested in oil companies like Exxon, and fossil fuel companies in general, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of the energy transition is to get out of these companies as soon as possible, and pivot to renewable energy firms.Several fossil fuel companies have claimed that they will engage in renewables adoption, carbon emissions reduction, and carbon capture so as to reach ""carbon neutrality"" or ""net zero carbon emissions"" by 2050. This includes many oil and gas companies listed in the last section, including , , , and of course, . Respectfully, I believe that these pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050 may amount to plans to be bankrupt by 2035.The renewable energy transition will transform the energy sector, and other sectors, in a span of years, not decades. Former fossil fuel companies like Enel and Ørsted have already invested heavily into renewables, and now only have to focus on expansion, demonstrating much greater foresight in the past and reaping the rewards for it today. In my view, the factors causing the ramp up of renewable energy usage will trigger rapid, exponential demand destruction of fossil fuels throughout the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors during the 2020s decade, leaving little room for fossil fuel firms in most markets by the mid-2030s. Fossil fuel companies that have no plans to be carbon neutral or renewables-focused by then would consequently have little recourse as multiple sectors of the global economy leave fossil fuels behind.Further, while many fossil fuel companies are taking credit for building up renewable energy generation capacity, these companies still rely almost entirely on fossil fuel energy to prop up their business. Shell is a good example: a renewables-focused section of its website touts its wind and solar projects as contributing  (expressed as 1000 gigawatt hours) of renewable energy to the grid, but even if Shell's total renewables amount was doubled to account for nuclear, hydropower, green hydrogen, etc., it would still account for less than one percent of Shell's  of total energy produced in 2021, with the difference being made up of fossil fuels. This is at a point in time when, according to the International Energy Agency and International Council on Clean Transport, electric vehicles jumped from  to  of the global car market for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.In other words, as one of the biggest sources of global demand for Shell and other oil companies products, gasoline/petrol, is being eroded at an annual rate of 4-5% in absolute terms, and with an acceleration of such erosion very likely due to the factors detailed throughout this article that will boost renewable technology adoption, Shell declares that it is still more than 99% dependent on the very product whose demand is being eroded. This clearly does not bode well for oil companies' prospects during the energy transition, as many, if not most, other oil companies are in roughly the same condition of oil dependence as Shell, and display a severe lack of urgency in switching to renewables.But even when these companies promise to transition to renewables or go net zero, there is no guarantee they will follow through. Oil firm BP p.l.c. (, )  to cut natural gas production by 40% and end oil and gas exploration for the foreseeable future, among several other climate initiatives. Yet now, the company is  on its climate plans, perhaps due to a banner year for its finances on the back of record oil profits in 2022 that the company is loath to give up. Whatever the reason, such backpedaling shows that oil and gas companies cannot be counted on to fully commit to transition to renewables.On top of this, many fossil fuel firms list natural gas as a renewable fuel, and count it as part of their net zero goals. NiSource is a good example of this. Its  (page 14) is to reach net zero by 2040, which sounds impressive on its face, but the company goes on to say that it will do so by ""advanc[ing] other low- or zero emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and , and support the deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies, "" (emphasis added).At baseline, the inclusion of natural gas, to be sure a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal and oil, is nevertheless at odds with any zero-emissions goals. Pivoting to this slightly cleaner fossil fuel will only delay the inevitable for any company trying this strategy, because natural gas, even renewably generated gas, still produces carbon dioxide emissions when burned for energy, just like oil and coal do. To add insult to injury, the main component of natural gas, methane, has more much  than carbon dioxide when it leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned. Natural gas is also usually mined or otherwise extracted from the ground in large deposits with other fossil fuels, with all the related environmental concerns that such extraction brings; this makes natural gas prone to the same centralization issues and market quirks that consumers dislike regarding oil. For these reasons, I think natural gas is on the fossil fuel chopping block this decade, along with oil and coal.Worse yet, while NiSource acknowledges that its reliance on gas necessitates engaging in carbon capture to reach its 2040 net zero goal, the company cannot even guarantee that it will be able to capture as much carbon as it emits in 2040, since it is uncertain of the technological and economic feasibility of carbon capture by its 2040 timeframe. To be fair, I doubt any company can predict the long-term feasibility of carbon capture at this time. Logically, then, all companies relying on the assumption of feasible carbon capture to mitigate their natural gas or other fossil fuel usage are, in fact, merely  for net zero emissions by their stated timeframe, not actually committing to net zero.Sadly, NiSource isn't the only firm choosing the speculative path of carbon capture. Per the company's , Exxon states that ""[t]hrough 2027, we plan to invest approximately $17 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions … and [help in] reducing others' emissions through commercializing and scaling  …"" (emphasis added). Exxon's 2023 Climate Report also states that ""[a]ll energy sources are projected to remain important through 2050, with "" (emphasis added). This is in addition to the ""sustained investment"" in oil and gas, presumably by Exxon, that the company claims will be needed to meet the world's energy demands in 2050.Setting aside the strong possibility that oil and gas won't even make up a double digit percentage of the 2050 energy mix, this report makes me question whether Exxon's management is just skeptical of the coming wave of renewables this decade, or is simply ignorant of it. Either way, management's assumption of the continued reign of oil and gas, its implicit decision to divert even more funds toward oil and gas production over the next 27 years, and its inclusion of carbon capture as part of its net zero plans, reveal how unprepared it will be to steer the company out of danger if and when renewables begin to rapidly displace fossil fuels in the 2020s and beyond, putting Exxon's oil business and financial security at risk.For all their backsliding and sluggish execution, oil and gas companies appear to at least be talking the talk on adopting renewables and reducing carbon emissions. Coal companies seem content to say and do nothing, despite the even greater risks to coal as one of the dirtier and  fossil fuels (notwithstanding the current transient  due to the 2022 energy crisis). Case in point, coal companies Warrior Met Coal and Thungela Resources Limited () appear to have no plans to reach net zero anytime soon, even with the looming threat of electrified steelmaking technology indirectly , an industry central to both firms' businesses.In the end, the announced renewables projects and net zero goals by many fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, are unlikely to amount to anything substantial enough to save these companies from the harsh consequences of the energy transition, and they certainly won't be substantial enough to imperil my thesis. At the current glacial pace of renewables adoption these companies are engaging in, fossil fuel firms' oft-stated goal of net zero by 2050 is all talk. Unfortunately for these firms, while talk is cheap, renewables will be cheaper, and consumers will at least want to buy the latter by the mid-2030s.I believe that the oil industry, and the fossil fuel industry at large, is experiencing its last boom. Renewables are virtually at price parity with fossil fuels, declining further in cost, increasingly supported by regulators and governments, less risky in terms of geopolitics and national security, and are universally adoptable. Oil companies in particular have gained a negative reputation and a lack of loyalty from their customers, who will abandon them at the first opportunity. The headwinds that will catalyze said abandonment will strengthen over this decade, and soon the house of cards that is the oil industry's financial security may collapse quite suddenly. Subsequent revenue and earnings shortfalls will then trigger a major selloff of oil stocks, leaving many investors as blindsided bagholders.Since Exxon Mobil's fate is intertwined with the oil industry, all of these events mean that Exxon Mobil, once a king in the energy sector, is likely doomed to shrink into a shadow of its former self as the oil industry contracts, assuming the company does not go into bankruptcy during the oil industry's decline. Significant sums of shareholder capital invested in the energy sector could be lost along the way if investors refuse to acknowledge this likely reality.Meanwhile, renewable companies will become preferred providers of power, since their energy generation is a cheaper, safer, less risky alternative to fossil fuel use. Consequently, pure play renewable companies will gain the preferential treatment and market share advantages that fossil fuel firms, including oil companies, once enjoyed. This is in spite of fossil fuel companies' purported attempts to cut emissions and adopt renewables themselves; their lack of urgency exposes their renewable adoption efforts to be, at best, inadequate to address the challenges ahead of them as the energy transition proceeds in earnest.The trajectory of both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources is well-captured by a figure in a presentation by RethinkX, the think tank claiming that renewables have been cheaper than fossil fuels for over a decade. It visually depicts the feedback loops that tend to occur with most, if not all, innovative and disruptive technologies as they are introduced to the market and compete with traditional technologies. It also demonstrates the effect that these feedback loops have on market share; in effect, these loops propel disruptive technologies to exponentially capture share from traditional technologies until the disruptors completely replace the traditional players.This specific RethinkX figure shows the S-curve of market share transfer that will occur in the energy sector as positive feedback loops boost renewables, labeled the SWB (solar, wind, and battery storage) System, and simultaneously crush oil and other fossil fuels, labeled the Old Energy System. If you come away with nothing else from this article, at least remember this figure:Ultimately, the trends taking shape this decade foreshadow a steep and lasting decline for the oil industry, and massive losses may be in store for investors who believe the runway for oil is many years, or even decades, long. I therefore strongly recommend that long-term investors in the energy sector pivot to renewable firms now, and ensure that they are on the right side of the energy transition before it's too late.As for Exxon, needless to say, the company as we know it today is likely done for. Even if it becomes the undisputed king of the oil industry, it would make no sense to own the company's stock as the energy transition progresses, since Exxon will be taking a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. While renewables rise, fossil fuels, the oil industry, and Exxon itself will all be forced to contract in size, meaning that XOM stock will likely decline. As such, buying or holding XOM for the long term would only result in the destruction of shareholder capital.Therefore, for long-term energy investors, I rate XOM a strong sell, and I suggest that long-term investors also reconsider their ownership of all other fossil fuel holdings.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Occidental Petroleum: Take Me Down To 45Q Funkytown,"It's no secret. Shale companies are on a plateau, trading sideways to down from recent highs right now. Even with the price of WTI touching highs not seen in almost a year, many of the shale names are acting toppy. Our subject thisNormal trading in OXY stock is 7-8 mm shares daily but on the 15th, 23 mm traded to the downside. That coincided with a sharp drop in WTI () that day, from $91-89, so perhaps that accounts for the ever-fidgety seagulls taking flight all at once.The lads and lassies in the , have becomeIn this article, we will do a top-line review of the company in advance of the  coming on November 7th, after the close of business.In September, the stock poked its head above resistance at $64 and went all the way to $67, filling our heads with fantasies that it might be back on its way toward the middle $70s. Alas, that was not to be, as in the last few days it's formed what looks like a descending triangle on a technical basis. The next stop on this train could be in the middle $50s. Even the little bit of ""War Premium"" it gained following the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East is fading. When you add in the large build inventories this week, a case for somewhat lower prices is easily made for the near term.The company is a major producer of oil and gas globally with global production of 1.222 MMBOEPD, total U.S. production of 990K BOEPD, and Permian production of . The company also has lucrative chemicals - mainly caustic soda, a reactant used in intermediate chemical reactions to modify pH primarily. A  that facilitates its Permian EOR oil and carbon capture businesses. And, a nascent Direct Air Capture-DAC, carbon capture business operated by a  - Carbon Engineering.4-years ago the company made a transformative acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum that resulted in gaining some core acreage in the Delaware basin, and substantial U.S. GoM infrastructure. I , recognizing the hidden value in the deepest part of the Delaware basin, in terms of well productivity. Over time, the perception of this purchase has fluctuated, with some calling OXY a poor allocator of capital. Hmm. We'll see about that.The oil business has always been a ""Go for broke, raid the kids' college fund, put up the house title, and the pink slip to the pickup,"" type of enterprise. Not so much in recent years, but the spirit of the Wildcatter lives on even if the flame flickers a bit in the ivory tower reaches of the Corporate Boardroom. In the spirit of , Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha and convinced the """" to fund her ""swing for the fences"" deal for Anadarko. The next day, the petroleum powerhouse was snatched off competitor  table. Oil and gas from the Permian now provide about half of OXY's revenue, so the OXY purchase of Anadarko is standing the test of time in my book.Every silver cloud has a dark lining, and the debt required to complete this purchase, including $10 bn from , and the resulting issuance of a Preferred class of shares with an 8% annual coupon, nearly killed the company. Shares plummeted from the mid-$70s to as low as $9.46 in Oct of 2020. That was when I bought my initial position and have made several buys along the way.We all know higher oil prices and some adroit debt management saved the day-for OXY and a host of other E&Ps. In the intervening time, OXY has used the cash flow to repair its  with debt now at $19 bn as a result of asset sales and cash payments, and a DE ratio of 0.68, down from nearly 2X a couple of years ago. OXY CFO Rob Peterson noted the success of the past couple of years in this regard:OXY's rich Uncle Warren has increased , adding the luster of his storied name to the company. Even as  of the punishing preferreds Warren took as collateral for his $10 bn, and saving ~$100 mm in annual interest payments. Every little bit helps.OXY's efforts toward repairing the balance sheet have gotten to the point the company has been able to raise the dividend-still a shadow of its former glory, to $0.72 per share. As we head into the next couple of quarters it wouldn't surprise me to see a few more incremental bumps along this line. This should be significantly enhanced by the company's $3 bn share repurchase plan. At current prices, this commitment could take the share count down another 30-40 mm shares, from what is already a five-year low of 889 mm. As before, it all adds up over time.Carbon credits are all the rage these days. The CDR credits for DAC are just the latest step in the industry cozying up to the government for fun and profit. There is nothing like money from the government, as they have a boundless supply of it, and as has been aptly demonstrated in recent years, if they need more it's easily ""printed."" I am going to give a brief description of this program and the choice of laughing at its absurdity or crying at the futility of it all, is yours. It's ok to do both.All right, companies that remove carbon from the environment using  earn credits -  - credits from the . These CDR credits are fungible and can be sold to third parties. (Are you still with me?) Recently, through their  subsidiary, OXY has been growing a list of clients for their $1 bn 500,000 met ton annually DAC plant, now named Stratos. Amazon has just inked a deal to buy  over ten years, joining a growing list of companies signing up to ""decarbonize."" Vicki Hollub, CEO of OXY, comments in regard to Low Carbon Ventures:In the case of Amazon, it has been stipulated that the CO2 credits they buy will go into non-oil-bearing fields for sequestration, as noted below.The Inflation Reduction Act includes tax credits that range from $50-180 per met ton, so one can expect the retail value of a CDR is substantially more as this article in  notes.In summary, with a plant that can  remove 500,000 met tons of CO2 per year, OXY has the makings of a cash cow coming on line in 2025, and when fully subscribed. Simple math suggests a revenue potential of $175-200 mm per year using $350 per met ton. With a billion dollar investment there is a rough parity with a new build cost on a deepwater drillship, now fetching $450-500K per day. If OXY hits that $200 mm target, that's $547K per day, which suggests an acceptable return on investment. 1.5 talks of as many as 100 of these plants being built, and it wouldn't surprise us to see them all built out one. Uncle Sam is picking up a big part of ticket...so anything goes. It's only money, right? OXY shareholders stand to gain substantially as this gathers momentum.That's how you do it in 45Q Funkytown.The recent EIA DPR confirmed something we have been discussing for at least a year. Shale production is leveling off, and if the last three reports are any guide, could be entering a decline. One that's not explained by vagaries of the weather as in the Snow-maggedon of Feb-22, or a financial crisis. That's the macro picture.On an individual basis, shale daily output per rig has been on a long decline slope, until recently. This bit of data is pretty noisy and not amenable to much interpretation. The curve higher while total output has declined, as shown in the graph above, is interesting. Just throwing out a SWAG, I'd say this might be reflective of longer laterals and higher completion intensity.This is where the ""rubber"" meets the road in terms of technology. You will recall we discussed how  are changing the game in shale strategies. (If you are new and haven't read this article, you really should.)The gap between 2015-2023 is an  at the 150-day point. This is like having 4:1 in 2015, for considerably less drilling cost than it took to drill one well in 2015. Vicki Hollub comments on ramping efficiencies and the role they are playing in keeping costs down:In the Q2 call, the role modeling was playing in re-evaluations of lower tier benches to top tier benches was specifically mentioned. Vicki Hollub, who it should be noted is a petroleum/chemical engineer with decades of drilling experience, comments on the role modeling is playing in enhancing production:This is an unexpected dramatic turn of events. Upgrading benches? How is that possible? The answer is the role the big data sets that now exist play in giving operators much more detailed information about their reservoirs that enable these tier upgrades.Oil and gas prices have improved materially since late August. They are well off their mid-September peaks, however, and may see further degradation due to inventory builds. There is a reasonable probability these will continue as we are headed into  which will dampen the thirst for crude.Balanced against that are the proactive steps OPEC+ has taken in the past few months to support oil prices. In early October, these  to the end of the year. They could also be , as reported in an OilPrice article. With a lever like that adjusting production to keep it at a slight deficit to demand, we should avoid another collapse into the $60s.Occidental Petroleum Corporation is trading now at an EV/EBITDA of 5X and a price to flowing barrels of $60K per barrel. For a company with the acreage and other revenue streams they have, these values don't seem excessive under the market conditions we have now. With their cash flow sensitivity of $225 mm per $1.00 increase in WTI/Brent the rally from $70-90, translates to ~$4.5 bn on an annual basis, and taking this metric back toward Q-2, 2022 levels of ~$20 bn.Assuming WTI prices average more than $80, the EV/EBITDA ratio would drop to 3.75X. To keep things the same, the stock should rerate to about $80 per share. That has me thinking most of the seagulls are a bit too flighty and we ought to stick around for a while.Accordingly, I am calling for a hold at current levels, but just like Warren, if the share price were to drop into the $50s, it would be time to add.Fluidsdoc is an international oil industry veteran with 40 years of experience having worked on six continents and in over twenty countries around the world.

Russia to reveal new OPEC+ supply cut agreement next week - Reuters,"Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak informed President Vladimir Putin that Russia has come to an agreement with OPEC+ to slash oil exports to world markets, according to a .At a televised meeting, Putin asked Novak ifThe report did not elaborate on the parameters that could be revealed as they were unclear, and Novak's office refused to make an additional comment.Russia also said it would cut oil exports by around 5%, or 500k bpd, in August and by 300k bpd in September.The country may extend the cuts through October, Novak said on Wednesday, but added that it was too early to say definitively.",114,2023-09-01T12:07:59.000-04:00
Exxon Mobil: OPEC+ Is Coming To The Rescue (Rating Upgrade),"Exxon Mobil () experienced a sharp drop-off in free cash flow in the second fiscal quarter which is related to the decline in price realizations in end markets. Exxon Mobil still generated a solid $5B in free cash flow in theI previously rated Exxon Mobil a sell --  -- since the company’s free cash flow likely peaked in FYMajor OPEC+ countries Saudi Arabia and Russia recently decided to put into action major supply cuts that would see the combined output volume to be reduced by 1.3M barrels per day until the end of the year. Saudi Arabia  that it will reduce its oil production by 1M barrels a day while Russia  that it will also cut its exports by 300 thousand barrels a day. The decline in output has reinvigorated fears over energy supplies, especially ahead of a new winter season. Oil prices have soared on the back of such news, climbing back to $90 a barrel which significantly improves the earnings and free cash flow prospects of large energy producers like Exxon Mobil.Exxon Mobil experienced a rather significant drop-off in free cash flow in the second fiscal quarter which has been the result of lower average prices in end markets. Exxon Mobil’s average crude oil price (in the U.S.) declined 34% year over year to $71.37 a barrel while natural gas prices experienced a much sharper drop of 78% year over year to $1.45 per kcf. The second fiscal quarter was also the fourth straight quarter of declining average prices in Exxon Mobil's U.S. segment and the third straight quarter of negative growth in the natural gas business.The deterioration in the pricing environment in the last year has led to a significant drop-off in Exxon Mobil’s free cash flow. The company generated $5.0B in free cash flow in Q2’23 which was down sharply from the $22B free cash flow level which was recorded in the third fiscal quarter of FY 2022. But with OPEC+'s recent supply cuts and rapidly rising petroleum prices, Exxon Mobil has actually significantly improved earnings and free cash flow prospects.(Source: Author)The biggest competitor for Exxon Mobil in the U.S. is Chevron () and both companies trade at moderate price-to-earnings ratios. Exxon Mobil is currently projected to see a 35% drop-off in earnings per share in FY 2023, largely due to lower average prices. With price trends reversing lately, however, Exxon Mobil may see new EPS upward revisions. Currently, Exxon Mobil's shares are valued at 13.2X FY 2024 earnings compared to P/E ratio of 11.7X for Chevron. While I don't believe that Exxon Mobil is a bargain at 13.2X forward earnings, I acknowledge that OPEC's supply decisions could have a material impact on Exxon Mobil's profit situation.The biggest risk for Exxon Mobil obviously is a decline in average prices for petroleum and natural gas products because the production business accounts for the majority of the firm’s earnings and free cash flow. With declining market prices come weaker profit margins and lower free cash flow, however, so if the market doesn't trust OPEC+'s output decisions, energy prices may decline.Although Exxon Mobil saw a significant decline in its free cash flow in the second quarter, the energy company still reported solid profitability and OPEC+ looks to come to the rescue of major energy producers. Fears over additional or longer-lasting supply cuts ahead of the winter season have resulted in oil prices soaring back above $90 a barrel which should provide a decent profit and free cash flow boost to Exxon Mobil in the third quarter. While I don’t believe that shares of Exxon Mobil are especially cheap with a P/E ratio of 13.2X, I believe the change in energy market fundamentals justifies a rating upgrade to hold!

Why I Believe $200 Oil Could Be In The Cards,"Oil traders and analysts seem to underestimate the Israel-Hamas war and its consequences for the world's economy. Indeed, neither Israel nor the Gaza Strip have substantial oil reserves but there are not only two sides to the conflict. The war is getting moreI have been bullish on oil for a while.  on the subject wasThe map below was prepared by . The countries supporting Palestine in the conflict are marked in orange, whilst the militias are marked with red dots.As concerns Saudi Arabia, initially wanted  with Israel. However, as  escalated between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, the Saudi-Israel deal went on ice. Moreover, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a telephone call with Iran, Israel's opponent in the conflict, to discuss the situation. Simultaneously, Saudi Arabia is calling both sides of the conflict to peace and is trying to find a solution. In order to achieve this, Saudi Arabia and the UAE met to discuss the war.  Iran could be involved in the conflict. This could affect the Gulf countries' national security. That is why they have been pressing Western allies and Israel to de-escalate tensions in Gaza and lift a siege on the strip in my view.Here comes the biggest risk to the oil markets. Iran,  nations, has shown strong support to Palestine. It is highly likely to get involved in the conflict if the war intensifies. Yes, right now Iran is not having a war with Israel. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian  settlement of the situation in the Gaza Strip is becoming highly unlikely, and warned Iran may take """" against Israel. The minister also added the country did not initially plan to engage in a military conflict with Israel if Tel Aviv did not strike Iranian territory. At the same time, Iran may '' if Israel launches a ground operation in the Gaza Strip. , the latter seems to be inevitable.Moreover,  with Hezbollah, the military group located in Lebanon. Hezbollah has vowed to escalate if Israel begins a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which is likely, and Israel said it would retaliate. , """"The point I am making is that the situation in the Middle East might get more complicated.The situation is not new. The Israel-Hamas conflict comes 50 years after the Yom Kippur War. , the fourth of the Arab-Israeli wars, was initiated by Egypt and Syria on 6 October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. After that on , immediately after President Nixon's request for Congress to make available $2.2 billion in financial help to Israel, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) implemented an oil embargo on the US and started cutting their oil production. This made the global oil prices surge nearly fourfold. The prices rose from $2.90 a barrel before the embargo to $11.65 a barrel in January 1974. In March 1974, amid disagreements within OAPEC on how long to continue the punishment, the embargo was officially lifted. The oil prices, however, still remained high.I believe something similar might actually happen now. Although I doubt OPEC may implement an oil embargo, a potential war between Israel and Iran may lead to massive supply cuts. As can be seen from the map above, Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, also known as the Gulf. The Gulf is used to transport oil coming from the Middle East, most notably from countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Qatar. If there is a full-scale war, Iran might well close the Strait of Hormuz for all ships. Unfortunately, there are limited options to bypass the Gulf. Moreover, the very fact that there is a war in one country in the Middle East can disrupt oil production in the neighboring countries. Nowadays missiles are fired and infrastructure gets destroyed. So, there is a big risk as well.You might be wondering why I say that such a high oil price is well possible. But let us have a look at the history of oil prices in general.The diagram below shows the oil prices adjusted for inflation. If before the Yom Kippur War the prices adjusted for inflation were less than $30 per barrel (in today's money), then they surged past $60 in today's figures. So, it was a more than 100% increase.Inflation-unadjusted oil prices even surged fourfold as I have mentioned above.Interestingly, they remained at this level even after the embargo was lifted. That is because the Middle East region was quite unstable for a while. Regional conflicts are often here to stay. They do not always end in a few months' time. However, we can say that the US oil production was not as strong at the time as it is now. The oil production in North America is now accountable for almost 27% of the global oil supply. However, the Middle East still accounts for almost 33% of oil.Interestingly, earlier this year long before the Israel-Hamas war, some traders said oil could hit the $200 mark per barrel because of the conflict around Ukraine.  that oil could increase to $250 because """" According to the diagram above, CIS countries account just for about 15% of the oil supply. CIS countries or Commonwealth of Independent States include the Russian Federation, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. If a loss of less than 15% of global oil supplies can lead to such a price surge, imagine what would happen if a dramatic decrease in oil production happens in the Middle East.The point I am making is that a rise to $200 per barrel is a possible scenario.The risks to my thesis are obvious. As I am writing this, the yield on 10-year bonds is over 5% and the key stock indices are down somewhat. This is due to the fact the market expects the Fed to remain hawkish for a while. Obviously, this is a big downside risk to my thesis.If the oil prices remain too high, the Fed just like other central bankers may become even more hawkish because the inflation readings would also be high. This means they will keep raising the interest rates very fast, which will obviously provoke a recession. This will be a problem for the oil prices. However, in the 1970s this was not the case. In spite of the several recessions, high inflation, and very high interest rates, the oil prices still remained quite high.Another factor that could prevent the oil prices from surging further upwards is the conflict's de-escalation. This is well possible if the peace talks succeed. But in my view, this may take lots of time.In conclusion, I would say that the situation is quite complicated and might get worse. I believe a situation like the 1970s oil deficits and the resulting stagflation could be in the cards. It is well possible the conflict will be diplomatically resolved. But there are too many sides to it and it seems that tensions in the Middle East are here to stay. Another possible downside risk is that of a full-scale recession as the interest rates are going up. But high oil prices  an economic downturn can co-exist the way it happened in the 1970s. So, I am highly bullish on oil right now.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),"Over most of the past year, I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies, given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads. I  my long-term bullish take on MarathonHowever, as discussed more recently (), I've downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash "" in the ""crack spread."" As such, it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon, considering its stock remains generally high. However, its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon, particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines. The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk, as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopolitical-related production cuts. Overall, investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets, potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum, depending on how we calculate its forward valuation.For the most part, refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets, where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly. My long-term view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today. That said, the short-term outlook has changed as volatility mounts, raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline. See below:The first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022. However, oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around $87 per barrel today. Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil . Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped. Marathon has retained much of its value, but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income. The ""crack spread"" is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs. crude oil has crashed, particularly for the gasoline spread. See below:The heating oil spread remains high today, but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range. It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases, making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profit.Luckily, Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread. See its most recent analysis below:Since the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of ~$32/barrel to ~$19/barrel today. That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above. All else being equal, this $12/barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of -$12.96 annualized ($3.24B quarterly).  have only changed marginally over this period. Natural gas has also hardly changed, so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathon's refining margins.The company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023. However, this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathon's current EBITDA. See below:Historically, Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around $15, depending on changes in other operating costs. Today, that spread is below its typical range before COVID-19, indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability. The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around $1.5B per quarter from its Midstream segment. In comparison, its refining margins can vary from negative  (seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage). Its refining segment EBITDA was $3.16B in Q2 and may be as low as -$80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant. Combined with an expected +$1.5B from Midstream, I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at ~$1.42B, given limited changes in commodity prices and volumes.Marathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the . I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period. The spread averaged  during most of that period, or about $5 greater than the previous quarter. All else being equal, that equates to a ~+$1.35B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2, giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of ~$5.66B.Marathon's Depreciation and Amortization has run around $830M, and its interest is currently around $142M quarterly. Together, this creates an extra $972M added quarterly cost. Considering this, I project Marathon's Q3 pre-tax income at $4.67B, or ~$3.7B after taxes (~21% historically). The company usually has ~$350M in income attributable to non-controlling interests, giving a final net income estimate of $3.35B or an EPS of $8.38. This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at $7.48.For Q4, based on current prices, its EBITDA outlook is  lower at $1.42B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month. That equates to an estimated pre-tax income of $448M, or $353 after tax, and almost zero after non-controlling interest (~$4M, or a $0.01 EPS). The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at $4.53 EPS; however, those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downside.These estimates do not account for one-off costs, gains, or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market. I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathon's volumes will also remain constant. With hurricane season in full swing, refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels. Further, the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index I've used. The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically, so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA; however, it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates, potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to $7.5 and a Q4 nearer to $1.On Monday morning, both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 3-4%, indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk. While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities, I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand. As mentioned in my , the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies. Potentially, the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor. See below:EV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1%, that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive. Further, the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today, with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand. While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect, it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower. See below:Again, a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread. In my previous article regarding Marathon, my long-term view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade (and today in particular) would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil, contributing to a permanently higher crack spread. Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains, partially due .In the long run, I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline, leading to higher crack spreads. However, the short-term situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to . Further, the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue, particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasons.Gasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding. That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut. However, oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release. Of course, no more reserves will come out of the SPR, which has lost around half its previous storage levels. See below:We must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues. Currently, it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate, and most lack the information relevant to make that determination. Still, if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened, then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur. This potential "","" exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves (both strategic and commercial), could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel, considering it is . Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time. Still, gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices, mainly if it is already falling with the economy today.The US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC+ production cuts, offsetting the recovery in US oil production. That said, the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last. See below:As the rig count declines, future oil supplies should trend lower. That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline. Further, a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies, potentially harming Marathon's steadier income stream.At this point, it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count. Further, should global oil supplies decline enough, the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market. That said, I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon. I believe oil's bullish case has become much stronger, while gasoline is not nearly as solid, pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spread.At today's commodity prices, I believe Marathon's EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time. Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation, and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels. In the long run, I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil. However, in the short term, I believe MPC has ample 12-month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinery-margin profit decline shock.Looking forward, I expect MPC's Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer. However, from Q4, I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread. In my view, depending on how the oil market's situation changes, an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies. For this reason, I am bearish on MPC on a 12-month outlook basis. Its EPS may be around $-1 to $2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today, potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward ""P/E"" of ~30X.I rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period, but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable. I still like the stock from a long-term perspective, but not at its current price, given the immediate profit decline. To me, the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war,  global recession, causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer. If MPC operates in a ""highly sensitive "" environment today, it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world. Thus, if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years, as I've expected, its long-term potential would also be minimal.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,"This follow-up article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in U.S. energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering (2007-2022). In this period, the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet (""BCF"") of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas, it is important to first reference some history. Before that, we want to lay out some relevant terminology. Natural Gas, not surprisingly, is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature. It is measured in cubic feet at sea level (volume increases or decreases with pressure). It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet (MCF).Conveniently, one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1.036 million BTU (one author has a friend who considers this ""one of the proofs of the existence of God"") and this makes certain calculations easier (for example, a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad). Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs. After this removal, the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumers.First, a little bit of simplified but instructive history. Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers; these phases have been: 1) nuisance; 2) luxury; 3) necessity; and 4) national security. At first, it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually ""flared."" In fact, one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using no-flare orders. Natural gas began to be used in cities, but this was largely ""city gas"" produced from coal.It dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks, and pipelines started to make their way across the country. All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions. So far, so good.Then, the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, and the FPC (now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC) started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers. The ""experts"" at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production. There were various estimates, most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by now.This policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage, which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973. Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels, fuels for power plants, and in other applications. As oil prices rose, more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices. In addition, producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production. The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state (intrastate gas) was not price regulated, leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those markets.A complex mess emerged – loved by lawyers and lobbyists, but hated by the public. Each interstate pipeline had ""curtailment"" proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand. One point was widely agreed – natural gas could never be used ""under a boiler"" (i.e., to generate electricity). At one point in the interstate market, we came close to ""losing towns"" due to a cold January, and customers were told that it was patriotic to turn down the thermostat.Finally, starting in the Carter administration and continuing in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, wellhead natural gas production was deregulated. First, deep gas, then ""new"" gas, and finally all gas. It was confidently predicted by the ""experts"" that in 1984-85, when ""new gas"" was deregulated, there would be a monstrous ""fly up"" in gas prices. Just the opposite occurred, and gas became plentiful.As more and more natural gas began to be produced and as customers found that it was a reliable energy source, natural gas consumption and production increased. Now that natural gas could be used to generate electricity it gradually became a kind of ""default"" choice as a generating fuel. The electric industry has gone through various phases in terms of strategies for generation. In the early years, coal dominated. Then, there was a phase where it was trumpeted that nuclear power would take over and make electricity ""too cheap to meter.""For a whole series of reasons, this did not play out and after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, it became prohibitively expensive to build new plants. At one point, residual oil started to replace coal, and in some cases natural gas (remember that we thought we were running out of natural gas) – but the 1970s oil price shock ended that. In the late 70's, the government was encouraging ""coal conversion"" – which involved having utilities stop burning oil and start switching to coal.Now, in the 90's we began to see a halting but increasingly steady shift to natural gas. Coal was bad for global warming, oil was expensive, and nuclear was no longer on the table so natural gas was all that was left. Improvements in technology allowed for a reduction in the heat rate (the number of BTUs necessary to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity) from around 10,000 for conventional plants to 6-8 thousand for new combined cycle plants. Natural gas power plants were also much easier to site and less expensive to build than coal or nuclear plants. The table below gives total electric production and the natural gas share in 1977, 1990 (right after deregulation), 2007, and 2022 all stated in billions of kilowatt hours.Gas has increased its share enormously and that is the main reason that the domestic consumption of natural gas has increased. The table below provides natural gas consumption in the U.S. and net imports (the minus sign in 2022 means net exports) for those years in billions of cubic feet.We have been fortunate to have a massive increase in domestic production just at the time when natural gas was needed by the electric power industry. More recently, that increase in production has enabled us to become the world's largest LNG exporter and to help alleviate Europe's problem associated with the cessation of natural gas imports from Russia. Natural gas has now reached the point where its production has become a critical national security factor.The concern with global warming has led to a push for the deployment of energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. These energy sources – mostly solar and wind – generate electricity but are not easily if at all deployable to directly provide transportation, heating, and other end-use services. Even if a massive amount of energy could be generated by the deployment of these technologies, there would still be carbon emissions from fossil fuel use as heating, transportation, and other end-use fuels.As a result, climate activists have determined that a very high priority is the rapid electrification of the economy. This takes the form of mandates, prohibitions, and subsidies all favoring the replacement of gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles, and the replacement of natural gas use for heating, cooking, and other purposes with electricity. This electrification, it is assumed, will make it easier to reduce carbon emissions as solar and wind electricity production expands.At the same time, there has been strong pressure to shut down coal-fired power plants because of coal's very high carbon dioxide emissions. In the period between 2007 and 2022, the amount of electricity produced by coal plants has plummeted.It should be noted that there is also a general trend in developed economies for a higher and higher percentage of total energy consumption to be in the form of electricity. This trend is completely independent of efforts to combat global warming. The table below provides (solely for purposes of trend comparison) the total U.S. energy consumption in quadrillion BTUs and the total electricity production in terms of billions of kilowatt hours in 1950, 1975, 2007, and 2022.Over this 72-year time frame, total energy has increased by somewhat less than a factor of 3 while electricity consumption has increased by a factor of a bit less than 14. Even in the past 15 years, electricity consumption has increased while total energy has decreased slightly.Not surprisingly, climate activists have been somewhat more successful in their electrification strategy than they have with the actual deployment of renewable energy. The deployment of power plants and the necessary transmission facilities requires large-scale capital investment and is subject to intense and determined opposition that can stretch out the process or stop the project. While no one is going to sue me for buying an electric car, they are very likely to go to court to stop the production of the electricity necessary to power the car.All of these factors – the retirement of coal-fired power plants, the push for electrification, and the delay in the deployment of renewable sources of power – have created a massive opportunity for natural gas to expand its use as an electricity-generating fuel. The table below shows the billions of kilowatt hours produced by coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind in the years 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2022.Natural gas has become the leading electricity-generating fuel by a large margin. This past July we recorded the highest demand for natural gas at power plants in history one Wednesday and then the record was broken on the very next day. An interesting thought experiment would be to imagine what things would be like without fracking. We would almost certainly have had to import massive amounts of LNG which would have been much more expensive and one of the major issues in our society would have been the outrageous increases in electric rates.It is always dangerous to predict the future of energy consumption and production. However, it is reasonable to assume that policy provisions as well as long-term trends will increase the consumption of electricity in the near and intermediate future. It is also reasonable to assume that there will be continued pressure to shut down coal-fired power plants and that there may be some nuclear plants getting so old that shutdown becomes necessary. Of course, there will be increased output from solar and wind, but in that connection, the 2023 data so far shows no significant increase from comparable months in 2022. Wind may be moving up a siting cost curve having used up the sites where the amount of the wind resource, ease of construction, access to grids, and a low level of NIMBY opposition made costs reasonable. To a lesser extent, the same thing may be happening to central station solar.For this reason, one of our authors believes that distributed solar is the renewable technology that will grab the biggest share of the market going forward. Even with a massive expansion of solar and wind, the intermittent nature of these technologies will require a large and reliable base load capacity on the system and the phase-out of coal will remove many of the plants that supply such capacity. Natural gas is the only viable alternative in the near and intermediate term.In the long term the electrification of the entire automobile and SUV fleet would consume roughly 1 trillion kilowatt hours per year or roughly 25% of current U.S. electricity production (this is based on an assumption of a 7 to 1 kilowatt hour to gallon of gasoline ratio which may be optimistic). This massive increase in electricity consumption will add to the trends described above by requiring large-scale increases in generating capacity.Thus, viewing the U.S. energy market in isolation, it is almost impossible to imagine that there will not be an increasing demand for natural gas as a fuel for the generation of electricity. This will more than offset losses in demand due to the conversion of natural gas heating and cooking to electricity. In fact, such conversions are very likely – in the near and intermediate term – to result in increased natural gas being burned in power plants rather than in residences. The leader of the electrical supply team at the EIA (Energy Information Administration of the DOE) has said that ""Almost anywhere in the United States, any incremental increase in electricity demand is met with a fossil resource.""In the early part of this century, there was considerable activity on the Coast of the Gulf of Mexico planning and building LNG terminals getting ready for the ""inevitable"" need for the U.S. to import massive amounts of LNG because of the factors discussed above. As time passed the amount of gas produced through fracking surprised policymakers and began to produce a massive surplus. Plans were drastically revised, and in some cases LNG facilities were retooled so that they could operate as export facilities.In addition, methanol production (a technology for turning natural gas into a liquid that can be mixed with gasoline; methanol is extensively used in China) started to be planned for the area. Several major plants are now in production.The Ukraine war and measures preventing or at least dramatically reducing Russian gas sales to Europe created a powerful demand for LNG, and the U.S. was ready to jump into the breach. LNG exports have been increased and when added to the methanol production and export, now constitute a major portion of total natural gas output.The international market – in which the U.S. is now a major player – is complex. There is a considerable amount of ""stranded gas"" in countries subject to boycotts and sanctions. Iran and Russia could both be massive exporters in a completely free market. There is also natural gas in Latin America which is not being produced due to political factors. Some European countries could engage in fracking if they chose to do so. So, it is possible that in the intermediate or long term, U.S. exports will face competition from new sources.On the other hand, most developed countries (with some notable exceptions) face the same dilemmas in determining how to generate electricity that we face here in the US. Coal is available but disfavored due to carbon emissions. There is public opposition to nuclear. The intermittent nature of solar and wind requires a base load complement. As a result, there is likely to be an increasing demand for natural gas as a fuel for generating electricity in other nations.There may be political pressure against LNG exports both by those who believe that a ban would reduce domestic prices and by those who disfavor fracking. However, our allies need the additional gas. In addition, U.S. production is likely to be cleaner than the foreign production of gas or coal which would replace it – especially as strict U.S. restrictions on the leakage of methane in the process of production and transportation are implemented.While the export market may be more volatile than domestic demand, it is likely to be active and available to U.S. producers for a considerable time. It is ironic that, in a sense, we have done a full 180. From considering natural gas to be a finite resource on the brink of exhaustion and therefore viewing its use to generate electricity as a despicable waste, we now view it not only as our primary source for the generation of electricity but also as a source of revenue due to constantly increasing exports. This illustrates the tremendous difficulty of long and even intermediate-term energy projections. It is very easy for the ""universal consensus"" to be mistaken.The price of natural gas is volatile because its domestic use is weather sensitive. As a heating fuel, it benefits from a colder-than-normal winter. As an electricity-generating fuel, it generally benefits from a warmer-than-normal summer due to the importance of air conditioning demand. The best way to play this is to look for companies that earn money at least partly based on throughput or have a stable source of demand.In assessing other MLPs, investors can discover the percentage of revenue that is gas-related and can make a reasonable assumption that it is relatively stable. It is likely that the market has not fully digested the implications of the massive shift in the U.S. energy picture and there is still a considerable amount of money to be made.If you want full access to our Model Portfolio and our current Top Picks, join us at  for a .We are the largest income investor and retiree community on Seeking Alpha with +6000 members actively working together to make amazing retirements happen.

My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,"Through September the economy remains solid, but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead. Currently with the funds rate at 5.5% and the core CPI at 4.1% the real funds rate is 1.4%. ThatThe Fed can resume its fine-tuning operation later if the need arises, but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go. I'll agree that the bulk of the Fed's work is done, BUT I don't believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a last-minute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown, the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded. The first-ever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mix-raising the odds of a government shutdown in mid-November. While this situation won't affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that will.The political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics, fiscal spending, and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors, rating agencies, and voters. Now to be fair, the government's deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yields-the market's way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order. And, the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the government's out-of-control spending, the worse the situation will get.In an era of low inflation and zero/low interest rates, Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences. No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10-year Treasury yield now hovering around 4.9%. With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate, Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road. fiscal austerity would become a near-term headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates. However, that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2% target, so this growth/inflation/interest rate issue isn't going to be so easy to solve. However, as I will explain later, an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today. Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced before.The auto workers union is making (in my opinion) some outrageous demands. They are asking for a 40% increase in wages over 4 years, a 20% reduction in the workweek from 40.0 to 32.0 hours, and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of all-electric vehicles. The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands, poisoned any good-faith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainable.At the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rank-and-file union members. The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President. Against this background, it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly. As it progresses, the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip. The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparent.While investors seem to be pricing a ""soft landing,"" history is not on their side. The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history, and the market is still trying to absorb the impact. This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike, with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by near-term macro events. As rates have spiked, so too have long-term yields.Yield spreads also bear monitoring. The spread, or difference, between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, has been negative all year, i.e., an inverted yield curve, but has narrowed from a record -110 basis-point inversion in March to only 30 basis points today-not positive, but it's progress. Dating back to 1990, when an inverted yield curve has gone positive it can spell trouble for equities. It is not until the curve goes positive by about 125 basis points, do equities form a bottom and a rally ensues. I suspect we are a very long way from a yield curve that will be that positive.The past two weeks investors were reminded that they are operating in a world full of turmoil. We spoke about the terrorist attack in Israel last week, and as I'll speak to later markets tend to eventually calm and overlook these situations. The MACRO scene, however, has been impacted, especially  No doubt the  to Israel in what is their ""911"" event. Add that to the ongoing Ukraine situation and the spending/debt debacle in our economy, the ""rubber band"" gets stretched once again. The U.S. has pledged to Ukraine and now the administration plans to ask Congress for an  Israel that they will ""get what they need"" to defend themselves., but I am citing the facts and reality of the situation. These events along with the continuing overhang of the China/Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the weakest fiscal situation since WWII. In the meantime, taxpayers continue to hear the same rhetoric regarding ""spending"", as Treasury Secretary Yellen announced . Perhaps that might be true if they were the only issues that require boatloads of money to process. However, they are not.There is a contingent, in which Ms. Yellen is a firm supporter, that wishes to spend trillions on ""climate issues"" and an ""energy transition"". While the economy is doing well, welfare spending is near or at all-time highs. In fiscal year , the federal  spent $1.19 trillion on more than 80 different  programs. That represents almost 20% of total federal spending and a quarter of tax revenues in 2022. That is for WELFARE in a supposedly economy that is ""humming along""! The pandemic is over but the country's food stamp program reached an all-time high in November 2022 and remains at that level.Then there are the 6-7 million immigrants that have arrived, and they also come with a huge cost to social services, welfare, etc. Finally, the cherry on top of this debt cake. The cost of  the ""existing debt"" (not future debt) will be about the same as the existing Social Security program. In effect, we are soon going to be spending on TWO Social Security programs.Therefore it is a HUGE ""stretch"" to assume the U.S. can afford the two wars and will ever be able to enter a period of fiscal responsibility that is so desperately needed.It doesn't take a Wharton School graduate to realize that ""other"" spending must be curtailed. I realize I keep repeating that, but it is the lynchpin in this MACRO scene that will have the most impact. At some point, this notion that the climate is the BIGGEST threat to our economy has to be scrapped. If it isn't then you can kiss global economic growth goodbye. Given all of the other existential threats that are REAL, some will slowly come to realize what the common sense crowd has said from day ONE. ""The climate ISN'T the biggest threat to our economy"". The only question that remains is - is it already too late?Between the ""issues"" at home and with events and threats presenting themselves on multiple fronts abroad, the geopolitical situation is as fragile as it has been in decades. For the U.S., the latter is a self-inflicted policy error that leaves the  That in turn will negatively impact the financial markets for what could turn out to be a period The 3Q23 earnings season ramped up this week with 11% of the S&P 500 market cap reporting results, traders entered the scene with a wait-and-see approach. Financials started the EPS parade and investors liked what they saw and pushed all of the indices to gains of 1+% respectively on Monday.Tuesday rolled around and a ""HOT retail sales number tossed cold water on the enthusiasm as Treasury yields spiked to 52-week highs. The resiliency of this market came to light as the indices staged a complete reversal to wipe out the early-day losses to close flat for the day. The Russell 2000 bucked the selling trend all day and posted a 1% rally.Selling pressure was stepped up again on Wednesday in what turned out to be a complete wipeout with every index posting a 1+% loss with the Russell giving back all of the previous day's gain, then adding another 1% to make it a 2+% loss for the day. Thursday was a replay with across-the-board losses in every index and sector finishing in the red.A negative week ended on a negative note when the S&P posted its fourth consecutive day of losses. For the week, the index dropped 2.4% and that could be considered a fairly mild drawdown considering the negative backdrop. Since the July highs, this S&P pullback has now reached 7.9%.Every major index closed in the red for the week. The NASDAQ was down for the second week in a row and the Russell 2000 small caps made it three straight weeks of losses.The  fell 0.7% to 104.6 in September.  and follows the 0.5% slide to 105.3 in August.

Three components made positive contributions.Consumers showed their steadfast resilience and kept spending in September despite grappling with higher prices, interest rates, and a host of other headwinds piling up., more than twice what economists had expected, and close to a revised 0.8% bump in August. Retail sales in August were inflated after gasoline prices spiked, however. That was not the case in September when gas prices began to ease.A closely watched category of retail sales that excludes auto dealers, gas stations, and building materials and feeds into the gross domestic product jumped 0.6% last month compared to the prior month.September's uptick in retail sales, the sixth consecutive monthly gain, reflects how the U.S. economy has remained resilient despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool spending and hiring.In the good news is bad news backdrop, this number was considered a negative as it potentially keeps the Fed engaged in the rising rate scene.The  to -9.0 in October from -13.5, versus a 16-month high of 12.0 in August which was the only positive reading over the last year.

The indication that the FOMC could be sidelined by the rise in longer-term interest rates that are doing some of the Fed's heavy lifting was taken by the markets as a dovish stance and yields and the US Dollar tumbled, while Wall Street rallied.However, the markets shuddered at Powel's view that the economy's resilience could be because rates have not been high enough for long enough, suggesting a restrictive stance for a lot longer until the economy slows sufficiently to bring inflation to 2%.That is a message I sent a couple of months ago when we started to see the forecasts for a solid GDP forecast for Q3.--  - It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That is also frightening for equities.House Speaker Vote. It now appears there is no obvious path to 217 votes for Jordan, leaving some Republicans to wonder if they could elect current temporary Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry (R-NC). It's unclear if he can garner 217 votes either.The continuing resolution keeping the government open expires on 11/17, and besides the geo-political turmoil around the world that needs to be addressed, the longer the House goes without reaching an agreement on who to elect as speaker, the more likely it is that we reach that mid-November deadline without a budget agreement.Then there is the administration's emergency request to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine and Israel. With the slim Republican majority, they would need 98% of their contingent to back ONE candidate, and as we have seen that is an impossible task. An easy solution would be for the President to solve the issue by persuading a literal ""handful"" of Democrats to get behind a candidate (ALL have unanimously voted against any Republican nominee) and remove this obstacle.As far as the shutdown, as stated in earlier updates, it's a non-event for the markets. If the aid packages are deemed that important then the roadblock can be easily eliminated to approve the spending. With complete dysfunction in Washington, we're all suffering the consequences of politicians.After three years of overlapping crises, it is natural to wonder whether the surprise attack on Israel and its subsequent declaration of war poses another threat to the global economy and supply chains around the world. While these concerns are valid, I do not think the tensions in the Middle East will lead to any  Unlike Russia and Ukraine, Because of this, it is unlikely that the Israeli-Hamas war will disrupt supply chains or drag down economic confidence in the same way the Russia-Ukraine war or the pandemic did over the last few years. A major impact on supply chains could occur if there was an escalation in the war throughout the region.Fortunately, I think we have to view that as a LOW probability of occurrence. The only way the oil supply could be disrupted is if Iran were to enter the war. Iran has long been a financial backer of terrorist groups like Hamas, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that is very different from engaging in a direct military confrontation with Israel. As the leadership in Tehran knows very well, Israel is a nuclear-armed country and has the strongest air force in the Middle East. It would be downright suicidal for Iran to get involved. However, for a variety of other reasons, I do believe that the added uncertainty will hold oil prices near the $85-$90/barrel range. that are taking place in the Israeli conflict, but the war has not altered my asset class views or outlook for the US economy or earnings growth. First, from an economic perspective, Israel is a small country, with a GDP of $521 billion-making it the 29th largest country in the world, representing only 0.5% of world GDP. To put this into perspective, when measured by GDP, Israel would rank as the 13th largest state in the US (roughly the size of Virginia) and when compared to companies in the S&P 500, Israel is roughly the same size as the 15th largest company (Eli Lilly).Additionally, Israel is not a significant trade partner of the US, making up only 0.7% of both US imports and exports (the 25th and 29th largest trade partner respectively). And because of this, Israel is not big enough to derail the US economy from its current path. From an earnings perspective, given that I don't expect a significant economic impact from the war, combined with the fact that the S&P 500 receives only 0.2% and 2.8% of revenues from Israel and the Middle East region respectively, the conflict will not have a meaningful impact on earnings.Finally, it is worth noting that previous events in the region have not had a significant market impact. Unfortunately, conflict in this region is nothing new. Bespoke Investment Group notes that in the previous 11 major conflicts, the S&P 500 was up ~15% on average in the 12 months following the onset of the conflict and was positive 75% of the time.While this terrorist act may not change my economic views, it does highlight what is yet another global policy error that can have major MACRO consequences in the future.Iran did some saber-rattling this week by  The fact that Iran is in a position to make any 'calls' in this war is preposterous. The lack of global leadership in dealing with Iran is why there is a second global war being waged today. Shockingly the US continues to be the leading player in shirking responsibility by sending billions to what the  as a state sponsor of terror.If this terrorist attack isn't a wake-up call to impose economic sanctions that will  the Iranian economy once and for all then we can expect more of the same in the future. The FACTS, not opinion, rhetoric, or ""spin"", but FACTS, tell us the existing sanctions on Iran are NOT being enforced. Iranian oil exports have tripled in the last 2+ years. Instead of crippling their economy, the country's coffers have been enriched in the last 2 years.If common sense doesn't prevail, this war is just the beginning of global turmoil. The U.S. received yet another reminder that 'policy' errors have consequences when a  headed for Israel. After missing the opportunity to buy oil at a cheaper price, the U.S. finally decided to begin  (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). Energy Secretary Granholm has stated it may take up to two years to bring the reserve back up to prior levels. Combine this with U.S. Domestic issues that I'll present next, and it's easy to see why the price of crude oil will stay elevated and perhaps ratchet higher.There is  reason to abandon the energy trade.Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods announced that he struck a $59.5 billion deal to buy oil and gas explorer This deal can be read as a bet on U.S. shale fracking and a side-step against the US anti-fossil fuels policies. The acquisition comes at a time when the present hostile regulatory environment makes it more difficult to explore and develop new resources.This deal accomplishes quite a lot for Exxon  as the company becomes the biggest player in the rich  that spans Texas and New Mexico. In addition, the rising rate environment is making it more expensive to drill, and that should encourage more M &A activity.Being a low-cost producer with an enviable list of land assets, Pioneer Natural Resources is a ""prize"". Exxon will now have the luxury of bypassing the arduous and at times impossible task of acquiring new leases and permits. That means the newly combined entity will drill longer, more productive horizontal wells without wasting more time and money. Exxon has already stated that it can drill longer ""laterals"" Which means fewer wells which reduces the environmental impact.A the end of the day Exxon expects to double its current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is more than half of its current worldwide production. In a stroke of genius, Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. shale, while defraying costs, and in effect has outgamed the system that is at war with fossil fuels. In essence, this buyout of Pioneer makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing long-term supply and demand.U.S. oil output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. However, that is about to end, as the number of those wells has dropped to 830 from 3,330 in the Permian in the last 2 years. The Administration continues to slow-walk new drilling permits and leases, which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisition.The Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated five-year offshore leasing plan, more than a year late. It included a mere three auctions through 2029-the least necessary to comply with the IRA. Since 1992 no five-year plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales. That action sends large oil companies to move their operations The world will need fossil fuels for many decades, and at some point, the energy transition fraught with all of its issues will be   The costs associated with the transition run into the trillions and the money that has already been buried in this project has not produced anywhere near the solution that is required to run a productive economy.Finally, U.S. workers and the U.S. economy would be better off if production happened at home rather than overseas. The U.S. energy policy that I have warned about for the past two years is starting to show that 'policies' have consequences.The indices are all at a point where they could still go either way. Given all of the ""outside"" influences, the best scenario might be more sideways action. Plenty of starts and stops, with uncertainty sure seems like it will be part of the scene for a while. Perhaps for the entire 4th quarter. That tells me to stay diversified and look for ""special situations"".It's easy to see why I use technical analysis as part of my strategy. The S&P 500 rallied to a resistance trend line and was turned away. The battle will now be waged at what is considered to be an important support area for the index.The ball is in the BULL's court and it will soon be time for them to step up and defend their position. A 'break' of support opens up a completely different set of circumstances on the technical front.Once sentiment sours, NOTHING is going to change that downward price action. Plenty is going on now that keeps the  and why the volatility is ramped up. Headlines out of Israel, Drone attacks in Iraq, Navy warship intercepts Iranian missiles (U.S. policy errors have consequences), D.C. dysfunction, and higher Treasury yields are all impacting short-term sentiment.I've come to find that in most cases market ""reactions"" were consistent with what the ""charts"" are implying. Simply because they are giving us the pulse of all of the emotions that are present. Any investor that isn't using the ""technical aspects"" of the investment landscape as part of their strategy is coming to the gunfight with a knife.

Devon: OPEC+ Cuts Remain A Boon To Its Free Cash Flow,"We previously covered  () in June 2023, discussing the management's stellar capital allocation across strategic acquisitions and intensified capital expenditure for production growth, fueled by theFor now, the DVN management has further demonstrated excellent use of capital in FQ2'23, with $699M returned to shareholders (-41.7% QoQ/ -40% YoY), comprising $462M of fixed/ variable dividends and $237M of share repurchases.The latter has already reduced the oil/ gas producer's shares outstanding to 639M (-1.2% QoQ/ -2.2% YoY) by the latest quarter, otherwise, down by -5.8% from its peak of 679M in FQ2'21.This is on top of DVN's $6M debt repayment in FQ2'23 and another , bringing its overall debt down to approximately $5.92B (-3.8% QoQ/ -4.3% YoY).Therefore, while some investors may lament DVN's  payout of $0.49 (-31.9% QoQ/ -68.3% YoY), we are not concerned at all. Most of our optimism is attributed to the recovering spot prices by +26.5% for the  and by +22.8% for  from the May 2023 bottom.This is an important development indeed, since  is split almost equally between Oil at 323 MBbls/d (+1% QoQ/ +7.6% YoY) and Natural Gas Liquids/ Gas at 339 MBOED (+5.6% QoQ/ +7.2% YoY) in FQ2'23.While both commodities' spot prices may have been drastically normalized from the hyper-pandemic heights of $122.11 and $9.85, respectively, we are encouraged by this promising development. This is especially since the WTI crude oil spot prices remains elevated by +43.4% compared to the 2019 averages of $60.The higher WTI crude oil prices are likely attributed to the  through 2023, with the July 2023 ""production at (the) lowest since August 2021."" With a tighter OPEC+ supply and consistent global consumption, it is unsurprising that  has estimated that inventories will draw down in H2'23, ""placing upward pressure on global oil prices.""While the  has attempted to refill the US SPR to 349.54M barrels (-100.45M YoY) by August 25, 2023, up by +2.79M from the July 2023 bottom of 346.75M, there remains a great distance of -288.54M from the December 2020 levels of 638.08M.Depending on the  across the EU and the US, we may see gas prices continue to rise for a little longer as well.As a result of the great supply/ demand imbalance, we may see the commodities' spot prices remain higher, explaining the DVN stock's recovery since the May 2023 bottom.Therefore, it is unsurprising that DVN is trading at NTM Market Cap/ FCF of 9.40x, elevated compared to its 1Y mean of 8.51x.The same optimism is also observed with its oil/ gas peers, such as Exxon Mobil () at 12.06x, Chevron () at 11.65x, and Occidental Petroleum Corporation () at 8.88x, against their 1Y mean of 10.33x/ 10.13x/ 6.70x, respectively.Then again, we believe that DVN is still attractively valued, compared to the oil/ gas sector median Market Cap/ FCF valuation of 10.19x. This is especially due to the widening gap between the producer's WTI breakeven of $40 and the spot prices of $86.09 at the time of writing.The DVN management also guided a promising  of 326 MBOD (+1% QoQ/ +10.8% YoY) at the mid-point.This builds upon the excellent expansion of its FQ2'23 oil volumes of 323 MBOD (+1% QoQ/ +7.6% YoY)/  of 662 MBOED (+3.2% QoQ/ +7.4% YoY) and FQ1'23 volumes of 320 MBOD (+1.2% QoQ/ )/ 641 MBOED (+1% QoQ/ +11.4% YoY), respectively.Assuming a similar cadence through H2'23 with a moderate ~1% QoQ expansion, we may see the producer exceed its upper limit  of between 643 and 663 MBOED.This is based on our bullish FQ3'23 overall production projection of 668 MBOED (+8.7% YoY) and FQ4'23 projection of 674 MBOED (+5.9% YoY).Thanks to the higher WTI spot prices, we may also see DVN's Free Cash flow margins exceed 9%, as per the management's previous guidance. This is in line to the H1'23 FCF margins and much improved compared to the pre-pandemic average FCF margins of ~4%.As a result, investors may potentially look forward to an outsized H2'23 variable dividends ahead.While DVN may be trading near its July 2023 resistance levels, we believe that the stock is at a comfortable accumulation range since it is still near its fair value of $49.48, based on its NTM P/E of 8.82x and the  of $5.61.Therefore, we maintain our Buy rating for DVN, since the exercise may also allow long-term investors to drip and lower their dollar cost averages accordingly.

$100 Oil Is Only The Beginning,"Saudi Arabia is OPEC's de facto leader,  established to exert maximum market influence. The Kingdom primarily does what it likes, and the subservient OPEC members eventually follow. For instance, the Kingdom recently announced that it would cut oil output by  and warned that the supply cuts could deepen.Saudi Arabia's supply cuts are part of a long-term effort to elevate oil prices in partnership with Russia. While Saudi Arabia cuts by 1M barrels daily, Russia will continue its 300,000 daily production cut. Russia is the third most significant oil producer globally, responsible for roughly 12% of global oil output in 2022. Additionally, Russia is the undisputed leader in the CIS (former soviet republics) block, which accounted for roughly 15% of global oil production in 2022.Additionally, Russia faces difficulties due to its ongoing conflict in Ukraine and increased isolationism and alienation from the West. Therefore, these oil exporting juggernauts must maintain a relatively high oil price and should continue implementing strategies to keep oil prices heading toward $100 and possibly higher beyond that.Furthermore, there are continuous threats to production disruptions in the Middle East. Iraq is the third most significant oil exporter globally and is a perpetual hotbed for unrest and instability. Additionally, Iran remains a substantial producer and exporter and may face additional sanctions due to its destabilizing policies and direct/indirect involvement in various conflicts in the Middle East.The Middle East has the most dominant market position in proven oil reserves. Moreover, we see Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, and other OPEC nations sitting on oceans of black gold. Russia has a significant 6.2% portion, which could increase due to its enormous untapped and underexplored landmass. The U.S. only has 4% of the proven global reserves, limiting its influence in the oil industry.Europe, the U.S., and the West have minimal oil reserves and are primarily net oil importers. Therefore, much of the pricing power is with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and OPEC+, as these nations produce far more oil than they use. They can keep oil prices low for their domestic markets while constricting supply to increase prices for the export market, primarily to the U.S., Europe, and other Western markets. Due to the OPEC+ agreements, their oil production is expected to fall by an average of  this year.Despite America being a net oil importer and not having the most outstanding reserves or the best relations with the top oil exporters, the U.S. has the best oil companies in the world. U.S.-based high-quality oil companies have some of the most extensive expertise, professionalism, and advanced technologies required to locate, extract, refine, ship, and sell oil globally. Therefore, the U.S. oil companies make the global oil world spin, and they should benefit from the higher oil prices as we move forward.Some of my top picks in the oil and energy space include Take advantage of the  and receive this limited-time  with your subscription.  and start beating the market for Victor Dergunov is an independent investor and author with 20 years experience.

My View Of Wall Street: A Disturbing Macro Scene,"It is no secret that many of theSpeaking of a challenge, the Fed has been left with a near-impossible task. They are trying to come up with a solution that measures the right amount of restraint needed to bring inflation back was once believed to be a ""temporary"" issue beginning in 2021, but the inflation rate defied those forecasts and climbed until reaching a peak in March 2022. The Fed says it is determined to get it back to the 2.0% mark but it does not  - some four years after inflation began to move higher. We've already seen the effects. Higher prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services - gasoline, food, shelter, cars, hotel room rates, and restaurants.These price increases aren't going away anytime soon. It would be foolish to believe we won't see this issue having an impact well into next year, and perhaps well beyond that. The Fed's goal is 2%, but getting inflation back down to the 2.0% mark is not good enough.  to counter some of the cumulative buildup from the long-lasting run-up in inflation. The Fed will surely stay on course (higher for longer) but they are once again ""stuck"". I doubt the Fed can loosen the reins even after inflation hits its target as they will have to wait until this run-up in inflation is reversed.Inflation spares no one. It erodes the consumer's purchasing power. Unfortunately, the ones hurt the most are those at the lower end of the income scale and those relying on a fixed income. They cannot easily avoid rising food and energy prices and higher rent which consume a very large portion of their take-home pay. The warnings were there. Excessive, and as it turned out all of the added unnecessary spending to ""right"" an economy that was already ""right"", may remain a problem that can haunt the MACRO scene for a while.I do not agree with some market pundits' assessments that the economy is less interest rate-sensitive than it has been in the past. Their claim is relatively speaking interest rates are not high when compared to history. They have a point but that argument stops there. We've seen how equities  reacted to any movement in the 10-year treasury note. It's been the speed of these increases that kills their argument. If that isn't enough, after years of zero interest rates, the market will t, but this adjustment period will take time. There is also another unknown that not many are talking about. We have a large contingent of money managers and investors who have never been invested in a stock market where interest rates are moving higher. How they are reacting and how they will act when rates don't come down tomorrow is yet to be determined.So, as a result, I think it is premature to predict a soft, non-recessionary landing, and all systems go for a rousing BULL market. With multiple headwinds building on the horizon, a recession is more likely. How ""mild"" it is remains unanswered. However, if the Fed loses its patience or overstays its welcome (some believe they already have), the downturn could be more protracted than some of the forecasters expect. I'll note that the ""forecasters"" referred to in the last statement have dwindled to a scant few.What drives the U.S. economy is Consumer spending, which makes up nearly 70% of the GDP. With the strong labor market, good wage improvements, and all the pandemic stimulus they could ever want, consumers have danced their way through the Fed's aggressive rate hikes and higher borrowing costs. However, there are a few reasons why we can expect things to change. For starters, the labor market is softening. Second, excess savings from the pandemic are swindling so consumers no longer have a cushion to support their spending. Third, with student loan payments set to resume on October 1 (likely to subtract 0.4% from consumer spending in '24) and gas prices rising as oil prices move higher (from ~$68/bbl to ~$90/bbl), consumers should have less discretionary income to spend going forward. There is a positive, they do have a job, and as long as that remains the case, it will continue to be a tug-of-war. One that will resolve the recession/no recession argument.We have seen some weakness creep in and spill over into slightly weaker travel demand. Perhaps we have seen a near-term peak in travel after what has been a robust travel season. And with the headwinds building, a recent Gartner survey flagged that the upcoming holiday shopping season could be weaker than previous years, with only 9% of consumers expected to spend more this season.While economic growth, in aggregate, has not materially slowed, the Fed's 525 basis points of rate hikes are impacting the economy. With mortgage, auto, and credit card rates at multi-year highs, demand for loans from households has fallen dramatically. Banks are not only less willing to lend; the cost of borrowing has become prohibitive. For example, the  With mortgage rates now well above 7.0% and house prices still elevated due to inventory shortages, affordability is becoming a serious dilemma.While housing appeared to be stabilizing over the last few months, the recent plunge in housing starts (to a three-year low), drop in home builder sentiment (to a five-month low), and sharp decline in prospective buyer traffic (to its lowest level since February) point to further weakness ahead. And with buyers more likely to postpone their home purchases and existing homeowners frozen in their homes, the multiplier effect from housing-related spending is likely to dry up.Mortgage, auto, and credit card rates have gone up dramatically since the Fed kicked off its tightening campaign nearly two years ago. As a result, affordability is becoming a major issue.At some point, all of this is going to matter and it will result in a slowing economy.Much of the improvement in the equity market this year has come through an expansion in the price-earnings multiple. The good news reflected in the multiple expansions ran its course during the first few months of the year. That along with more investors joining the soft landing army has kept stocks from following through on last year's BEAR market.Analyst are still optimistic, as their earnings outlook for 2024 remains strong. Consensus is at $248 and Goldman Sachs comes in at $237. That of course is assuming a  outlook. My view is that a more challenging macro environment over the next few quarters suggests that earnings are more likely to tread water in 2024.As a result, companies are likely to have difficulty maintaining their top-line sales growth and delivering improving margins in a recessionary environment. The good news: earnings are not likely to fall precipitously from here, and they will need to move higher from here for equities to deliver the next big uptrend in the market. Once again, investors are left with a glass half-empty, glass half-full situation to try and figure out.Bottom line; It is a difficult market backdrop to navigate. Good news to start the Monday session. The equity market wasn't influenced by the interest rate scene because the bond market was closed for Columbus Day. The Bad news is the terrorist attack over the weekend in Israel that has sparked a war and dampened global sentiment. The S&P turned a morning loss into a gain for the day closing at 4335 up 0.63%.Treasury rates dipped and the U S dollar retreated and the rally continued, The S&P 500 and NASDAQ ran their winning streaks to three while the Small caps as measured by the Russell 2000 () made it five straight days of gains.It was more of a choppy session on Wednesday but the resiliency of the market came through as another late-day rally pushed the S&P and NASDAQ to five straight winning days. Both of those streaks were broken as overhead resistance tuned back the S&P 500 to a minor loss for the day on Thursday. All of the indices closed in the red and only two sectors () and XLK) showed modest gains on the day.The selling continued keeping the major indices in retreat. In a BULL/BEAR tug of war, the S&P managed to squeak out its second week in a row with a gain. The DJIA was also fractionally higher this week. No so for the NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 as they both lost ground. For the Russell that made it two weeks in a row and five out of the last six with a loss.  That is hardly a BULL market setup and highlights the fact that to be successful an investor has to be very selective.U.S.  popped 0.5% in September and the core rate was up 0.3%. .

When we view Inflation in the context of a 2% Fed target- Inflation is far from dead. While I agree that it was trending in the right direction, this trip to the target is going to be a long and winding road.

The good news is that new homes are still hitting the market; they're not impacted by the desire to stay in a low-rate mortgage which has hit existing home supplies. But with 30-year fixed-rate mortgages hitting 7.89% this week per the MBA data, even the new home market is struggling mightily amidst major concerns for affordability. With yields pulling back now, we may not hit 8% mortgage rates, but we sure got close. decreased by half of a point in September to 90.8. September's reading  Twenty-three percent of owners reported that inflation was their single most important problem in operating their business, unchanged from last month and tied with Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB Chief Economist; plunged 5.1 points to 63.0 in the October preliminary print. That's much weaker than expected,  However, the direction is not surprising given the various headwinds of inflation and the dysfunction in Washington. Much of the weakness was in the expectations component which dropped to 60.7 from 66.0 previously. The current conditions index slumped to 66.7 from 71.4. The 1-year inflation index surged to a 3.8% rate, the highest since the 4.2% clip from May.The latest minutes from the September 19th -20th policy meeting at the Fed showed unanimity across all members that rates should ""stay restrictive for some time"". The fact that rates are now in restrictive territory means that the Fed can ""proceed carefully"" given the general agreement that risks to goals are ""more two-sided"". Consistent with recent commentary from among others Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, ""several"" members attempted to shift the debate over rate policy from ""how high"" to ""how long"".None of this is a surprise to anyone who carefully watches FOMC's public statements. As a point of fact, there was no notable new information in the minutes that had not already been highlighted by the Fed for months on end. Only those who still believe in the Easter Bunny were surprised and caught off guard.The spike in Middle East tensions following attacks on Israel may help resolve domestic U.S. uncertainty related to the ongoing House Speaker battle and clarify the path forward for new defense funding. This  and general market concerns over DC dysfunction if the events over the weekend materially raise pressure on the House to return to regular order. We've already seen a bounce in ""defense sector"" stocks which have been sold off hard since September 1.The market will be watching to see whether a consensus Speaker candidate emerges within the GOP and if clarity around the appropriate level of aid for Ukraine becomes more of a focal point, although the path forward on both issues remains highly uncertain. A tightening of oil export sanctions by the U.S. on Iran can also impact the global supply balance, While the U.S. markets will tend to overlook these events (we saw that with Ukraine), this conflict does have a genuine (if relatively low probability) possibility of large spillover. This terrorist attack is the equivalent of our ""9-11"" where civilians were targeted. A severe Israeli response can't be ruled out. That would include expanding this conflict to Iran, the poster child for state-sponsored terrorism where  were made known in September. Rest assured, Israel will continue to question Iran's involvement the risk premium reflected by stocks, bonds, the dollar, and most of all oil will quickly retreat as is usually the case in periods of geopolitical instability. That should be an investor's baseline view.For others who may be worried about the situation spiraling into something greater (a possibility if Israel decides Iran funded the attack), from a market perspective, you can perhaps look to something like VIX, Gold, Oil, or products related to these. That could provide some protection in the case of a more severe move,I shy away from going overboard with reacting to news and ""what if"" scenarios because when it comes to investing, they never go away.A breakthrough in the House Speaker's race this week as Jim Jordan (R-OH) offered a nomination speech for Steve Scalise (RLA) in a floor vote. Scalise got 113 of 221 House Republican votes. 217 are necessary to be elected Speaker. While Jordan's willingness to back Scalise is progress, we could be headed for the same kind of iterated floor vote drama that took 15 rounds to elect Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) last January; it will all depend on fringe members like Matt Gaetz (R-FL).That breakthrough turned into a breakdown. Initially, there were roughly a dozen (and counting) House Republicans who were adamantly opposed to electing Steve Scalise (R-LA) Speaker. With only a four-vote margin in the House, that means little prospect for a resolution to the Speaker's race in the foreseeable future.So, Republican Speaker of the House candidate Steve Scalise (R-LA) withdrew his name from consideration. Following a series of meetings Scalise reached the conclusion that the GOP caucus would never reach the near-unanimity required to elect him (or anyone else) Speaker. The alternative candidate is Jim Jordan (R-OH) who only lost the internal caucus vote on Speaker candidacy to Scalise by one vote. But his aggressive conservative leanings (among other issues) could make him a tough pill for moderates to swallow.Of course, if Democrats could be pulled into the voting process almost any GOP candidate would have the votes to win. But the opposition is almost certain to require a very, very high price for that kind of support, and it's not clear anyone in the GOP caucus would be willing to go down that road.One possibility that is being discussed is that Acting Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry (R-NC) simply continues in the role indefinitely, moving legislation that is critically important without ever being formally elected Speaker. This would certainly solve some problems, though it's not clear how McHenry would be empowered to deal with issues like keeping the government open when the temporary extension expires in November.The geopolitical backdrop for energy can contribute to higher oil prices over the medium term with tools available to control prices and keep them higher.Factors for price support around the current range (or higher) include;However, expectations are that OPEC/Saudi Arabia would put supply back on the market if concerns around demand destruction were to escalate. Here is the WILD CARD. China's sustained oil import demand - it is the world's largest importer - in the face of slowing economic activity will be a factor to watch over the coming months. There is a wide range of scenarios for why China would continue to sustain high import levels, including a desire to take advantage of lower market prices vis-à-vis building up of reserves (China has never been a member of the International Energy Agency and thus needs to have its stockpiling effort). Another, more concerning, possibility is that China is building stocks in anticipation of geopolitical disruption to supply. They are the largest buyer of Iranian oil. It has been noted that China purchased significant quantities of LNG in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Finally, further use of strategic stockpiles is another option for the U.S., especially heading into the 2024 election cycle. However, at some point, that option runs out and we are very close to that being a reality. It may be symbolic but like the first SPR drawdown, it will prove meaningless.After the terrorist attack last weekend we now have another geopolitical event that bolsters the energy trade. I'm puzzled when I hear that sanctions haven't been relaxed when it comes to Iran, an .Janet Yellen - yesterday;The chart of  in 2023. They stand at an astounding 5-year high, and China is the principal buyer. ""Despite sanctions, the People's Republic of China has purchased roughly $47 billion in Iranian oil since this administration took over. Regardless of who is buying (a story for another day) the fact that this oil is hitting the open market.So if the sanctions haven't been relaxed (we'll never get a straight answer)  That isn't my opinion - the facts indicate that to be true. Despite the deep discounts Iran has placed on their oil exports it is safe to assume they are reveling in this windfall. Without oil, Iran has no money. Without money, terrorism loses its biggest benefactor.The reason I bring this up is twofold. One has to wonder why a state sponsor of terror that has supported a known terrorist organization like HAMAS since 1990 and is a  is still participating in the global economy. Quite frankly it makes no difference if they were directly involved in  barbarism or not - as an identified state sponsor of terrorism , they should be isolated and cut off from global trade. The Facts support that and ""many"" global leaders are once again burning their heads in the sand and denying what is right in front of them.I'll now offer an opinion. History suggests only a naive child would believe Iran all of a sudden decided to stop supporting the terrorists. While everyone is looking for evidence that they  involved, there is NO evidence that they . If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck - the probability that it is a duck is VERY HIGH. Be that as it may, the next set of circumstances could very well change the dynamics in the oil market.Secondly, if Israel or a coalition of nations comes together and takes Iran off the world economic map with , (and/or destroys their oil output facilities) then all Iranian oil comes off the market. China will go scrambling to fill that void. None of this is political, it's a fight against terrorists. Similar to when the US decided to destroy ISIS.It's simply another reason to remain with the energy trade, as ""pressure"" from geopolitical events will likely remain high for quite some time.The S&P followed through on the prior week's gains and then hit a resistance level that for the time being has turned the index back.If we are going to see a Q4 rally the index has to hold at or near these levels. If this week's failure proves to be another resistance level that can't be overcome, the S&P is in danger of posting another LOWER high from the ""TOP"" that I noted on July 31.At best a questionable technical scene for the S&P 500.Even though perfection is not necessary for a bottom to form or to make money off of it, the stock market continues to play out in a mostly typical bottoming fashion. Post-Labor Day through  Performance is now more likely to be influenced by 3Q earnings season. I am seeing plenty of caution in earnings outlooks ahead of this earnings season and going into this week the bar seems to be set quite low. That increases the probability that we could see more upside surprises.The market by its price action after the terrorist event in Israel, today tells us this new geopolitical situation will be similar to what we saw with Ukraine and  won't be that impactful on stocks. The market will get back to inflation. On both the PPI and CPI front, it sure is another ""Higher for Longer "" scene, and that keeps the Fed's ""higher for longer"" rate outlook intact. The market will now have to swallow that as the handwriting that has been on the wall for months has to be reckoned with.Friday marked the unofficial kickoff to earnings season with the major banks and financial companies reporting, and so far, the results have been promising. Between the reports of BlackRock (), Citigroup (), JPMorgan (), PNC, and Wells Fargo (), they've all topped EPS forecasts, and only BLK reported weaker-than-expected sales. A lot can change between then and now, but the immediate first impression is positive.For every near-term positive, I can conjure up a near-term negative. This backdrop isn't for amateurs.Despite all of the near-term woes, money managers and analysts are hopeful their wish comes true; A year-end rally. When I reviewed the status of the ""BULL""(?) market recently I found an interesting picture. One that suggests it is a bifurcated market scene loaded with uncertainty.While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still holding onto their uptrends, the DJIA dipped under its longer-term trendline recently for a few days. The Russell 2000 has broken its uptrend and it's been more than just a few days, as this index has screamed a slowing US economy for over a year now. As mentioned earlier the small caps are 30% below their all-time highs. In an unsettled and questionable stock market, it's not uncommon for trendlines to break over a short period just to shake out some of the weak hands, but unless those levels are quickly reclaimed, it often signals a shifting trend in the market. I saw a few more pieces of the puzzle hit the board last week, but there is still a long way before this Q4 picture is complete. I do expect to see the stronger groups remain in demand as it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as money managers ""want"" to have these stocks overweighted in their portfolios. For a  to materialize, sectors like the semiconductors will have to step back up and become leaders again. If we are to see any continuation of a rebound off the lows we will need interest rates and the USD to slow down their parabolic rallies. That is easier said than done.Nothing has changed - selectivity is the name of this game. On Monday I released a list of ten stocks that should be accumulated for a late-year rally.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,"There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer. ThisWe've already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger & acquisition activity in the sector with  () and  () being acquired. There will be more similar opportunities in the future. For now, let's take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the U.S. energy sector.In the past 15 years, U.S. energy production has skyrocketed. Since 2007, we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter. We have increased naturalBut today – we don't hear much about this from politicians or in the media. It may be that, with today's political alignment, the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations – and, for other reasons, the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that fact.This article deals with the general effects of this development. Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topics:The table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022. Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time period.There has been a major decline in coal production, but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources. On a Quadrillion BTU basis, the decline in coal production has been roughly 11.458; while the increases in petroleum, natural gas, solar, and wind production have been respectively 13.969, 17.320, 3.504, and 1.814 for a total net increase of 25.149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly one-fourth of our total annual energy consumption. This has not been a demand-driven increase in production. During these same 15 years, the annual energy consumption in the U.S. has stayed roughly equal, actually declining slightly from 100.9 Quads to 100.3 Quads. There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables. But an equally important shift has been that the U.S. is no longer an energy importer and, in fact, exports petroleum (on a net basis), natural gas, and coal.Back in 2007, the massive U.S. oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which, in turn, was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices. Heading into the Panic of 2008, oil prices briefly reached $145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach $200 a barrel. When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day, $200 a barrel means more than $700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits. This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates, confidence in our economy, and economic growth.There is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy. Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of ""choke chain"" on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil, which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which, in turn, produced a recession. An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973, 1979, 1990, and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases. There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middle-income (and other) Americans who had to pay more money for gasoline.While the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them, the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental. Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lower-middle-income Americans especially hard. Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas, and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spend higher than average amounts of take-home pay on gasoline. The drain created by gasoline price increases may have increased the number of residents who defaulted on the mortgages that backed the securities whose failure led to the Panic.Now that we are no longer major importers of oil, it is still possible for world oil prices to increase and for that to increase U.S. gasoline prices. But there is an important difference. In 2007, the money being spent to buy more expensive imported oil was going overseas and, in some cases, was not easily recycled into the U.S. economy. If we had a major price increase today (as we had in 2022), the money would stay in the U.S. economy and go to higher royalty payments, higher tax collections in oil-producing states and localities, increased CAPEX by oil producers, and increased dividend payments to owners of U.S. oil companies. This immediate recycling of funds within the U.S. economy may have the effect of reducing the negative impact of higher oil prices on growth and reducing the danger of a deep recession. This may be a factor (although certainly not the only factor) in the surprising resilience of the U.S. economy in the current cycle.It should be noted that the U.S. economy can still be impacted by a cutoff in oil imports or a massive increase in the world oil price. While we are net exporters, the petroleum market is complex, and we still import crude and export refined products. Refineries are generally set up to refine certain types of crude, and transportation economics often leads to imports in one part of the country and exports in another part. Due to this complexity, an abrupt cessation of oil imports would be disruptive, and it would take time and expense to adjust. But the degree of disruption would pale in comparison with the impact we would have suffered in 2007.Now that the U.S. is actually a net exporter of energy rather than an importer, an increase in energy prices will tend to reduce the U.S. trade deficit rather than increase it. This would tend to strengthen the dollar. Most of our trading partners are actually net importers, so their currencies may be negatively impacted by higher oil prices. The net effect in the long term may be a stronger dollar which tends to reduce inflationary pressures.The fact that the dollar is not likely to be negatively affected by the rollercoaster of oil prices, although competing major currencies (the euro or the yuan) may suffer negative effects, is likely to cement the dollar in place as the global reserve currency.The fact that we are no longer dependent upon oil imports will likely enhance our national security. In the 20th century, oil was a major factor in the cause and the course of World War 2. Our oil independence may give us more leverage in confronting various oil-exporting countries (including Russia). The Strategic Petroleum Reserve – originally set up to ensure that our military would have access to oil in the event of a cutoff of imports – now does not really need to serve that purpose. Instead, it can be used to cushion the market from price fluctuations and also to generate profits simply by buying at low prices and selling at high prices. The Biden Administration seems to have adopted this policy.As noted above, the petroleum market is complex, and we should take measures to protect ourselves against the disruption that an abrupt cut-off would entail. It is also the case that many of our allies are net importers, and we would try to help cushion the impact upon them by increasing our exports if their imports were disrupted. But – again – the impact of an import disruption upon us from a national security perspective today would be sharply reduced from the impact we would have suffered in 2007.The above factors lead to certain conclusions from the perspective of investment. They definitely make investment in the U.S. more attractive than investment in markets which would be subject to severe impact from higher oil prices or an oil import disruption. The enhanced resilience of the dollar makes investment in dollar-denominated assets comparatively attractive.The U.S. energy sector also becomes more interesting because of its ability to serve as a source of exports to our allies; especially in the natural gas-oriented sector, certain names should command investor attention.

Rising Instability And Its Market Impacts,"This piece revisits the current U.S. fiscal debt and deficit system, in light of the ongoing problems in the U.S. bond market, and explores some investment themes amid this very ""macro heavy"" environment.Long duration bonds have enduredI've been bearish on bonds for a number of years now (see """" from July 2019, """" from April 2020, and """" from August 2020), but the nominal degree of this drawdown over the subsequent 3-4 years has been surprising even to me.I think the main part of this drawdown is mostly done for the time being, and TIPS are looking interesting here with their positive real yields, but the overall fiscal picture remains highly problematic.In various fields of engineering, such as control engineering or mechanical structural design, the concept of  is very important, and it means something quite specific.A system is either stable, unstable, or marginal, as shown by the pictures above.-A  system has a bounded output that reduces over time when given a bounded input. It tends towards calmness. If you hit a metal beam with a force, for example, the resulting vibrations in the beam will diminish in intensity over time. If you have an electromagnet and sensor system trying to  by measuring the position of the ball and automatically varying the power of the magnet accordingly, a stable system will be able to reduce the ball's oscillations until it hovers motionless. If you poke the ball with a small force, it will oscillate a bit from the dislocation, and then return to calmness.-A  system has a bounded output that remains in motion when given a bounded input. In other words, the system might keep oscillating but the oscillations won't get worse. It would be like if you poke a levitating metal ball and it just keeps oscillating but still able to levitate there. The control system is keeping it in check but is unable to get it back to calmness. Every time it applies a magnetic force it slightly overshoots, and then when it pulls back on the magnetic force it slightly undershoots, and so the ball keeps getting pushed around, but not getting worse.-An  system has an unbounded output when given a bounded input. The oscillations will keep getting bigger, like how if you push a child on a swing at the perfect time while she is already starting to travel in the direction of the prior push, then you can apply a pattern of pushes that keeps her going higher and higher each time even though your push strength doesn't change. The inputs are  into a larger and larger output oscillation. This is how a singer can shatter a wine glass with her voice if applied to the glass's mechanical resonance frequency, or how soldiers marching over a bridge can collapse the bridge if their unified footsteps match the bridge's mechanical resonance frequency.When thinking about the financial system of a developed country like the United States, our mental model generally views them as marginal systems: a series of oscillations that stay within the same overall bounds. Sometimes debt levels go up, and sometimes we need to tighten our belts so that debt levels go down. Sometimes the central bank tightens monetary policy, and sometimes it loosens it. The financial system, in other words, is thought of as being similar to how it was 20 or 40 years ago.But in reality, most financial systems are . They have an unbounded output in the sense that sovereign debt as a % of GDP keeps growing over time. Fortunately, the frequency of these systems is very long, so it takes decades for problematic levels of instability to build up to the point where the output gets out of control.When it does get out of control, the system needs to be reset, recapitalized, or restructured in some way. In other words, sovereign bondholders lose purchasing power through nominal default or, more commonly, through inflation. To use the control system analogy, the oscillations get out of control, the electromagnet drops the ball, and it has to be picked back up and put back in with some fixes.We can divide the modern (post-telegraph) era into three main global financial orders.Prior to the invention of the telegraph, there was very limited ability (e.g. fire signals in the night) to send information faster than the speed of human travel. The telegraph was invented in the 1830s, but it wasn't until the 1860s that it was deployed across the American continent, across multiple European countries, and across the Atlantic Ocean to link the whole Western world together. Separately, the Franco-Prussian war ended in 1871, bringing a period of peace to Europe.The combination of fast long-distance communication and complex paper financial instruments greatly increased the speed of commerce globally, at a time when gold was used as money. As a result, gold had to be increasingly abstracted in order to keep up. And this abstraction was done with credit.The international gold standard is generally considered by economists like Barry Eichengreen to have operated from 1871 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Under this scheme, gold was the base layer of money, and countries pegged their currencies to gold at a fixed rate. Whenever too much gold left a country or left central bank coffers, then that country could raise interest rates to attract more gold back into the country. There was a certain balance to it; a perception of stability.However, it was unstable underneath the surface. It was almost too efficient for its own good; physical gold rarely had to change hands. Hardly anyone wanted to withdraw and hold gold, and so an increasing number of paper claims existed for gold relative to the actual amount of gold. Most things were an abstraction built on an abstraction, with a lot of leverage. In his 1875 book , William Stanley Jevons described the efficiency of the system:However, he also posed a warning. This system was so efficient (he used the term ""excessive economy"" to refer to high levels of efficiency), and the system was levered 20-to-1:Indeed as the era of peace in Europe ended with the outbreak of World War I, this highly leveraged system failed. Gold pegs were subsequently paused and broken throughout the interwar era. Vast sums of money were printed relative to the amount of gold in the system, and anyone holding paper claims for gold was defaulted on and sharply devalued. It was like punching someone who was in the process of trying to juggle way more balls than they have hands.One way to visualize this is by looking at the money multiplier and total level of credit in the United States, which was better positioned than Europe throughout the war years.The ratio of broad money to base money in the U.S. increased from around 3x in 1870 to 9x in 1929, just prior to the banking collapse and Great Depression. And even base money itself was only partially backed by gold:With a double-digit ratio of the amount of broad money in the system (all of which is redeemable for gold on demand) relative to the amount of gold in the system, it was inherently unstable and prone to failure. Gold pegs were broken, and the currency was sharply devalued in order to bail out the highly leveraged system.They ended up breaking the gold peg, dramatically increasing the base money supply, and recapitalizing the banking system.As World War II came to a close, allied forces met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944 to discuss the next monetary system, and it was partially implemented in 1946. Under this scheme, the dollar would be backed by gold, but redeemable only to foreign central banks (it was actually illegal for Americans to own gold from the mid-1930s to the mid-1970s). Central banks could hold dollars and dollar-denominated assets like Treasuries and could peg their currencies to the dollar.In 1958, they , which had been in place during the post-war era. They sought to open financial borders and let market forces go back to work as global trade normalized. This marked the true beginning of the full Bretton Woods implementation. However, the system was unstable; the financial system was fractionally reserved, and yet there was only a finite amount of gold in the U.S. Treasury's reserves.From 1950 to 1970, the amount of base dollars in the United States more than doubled, and the amount of broad dollars more than tripled. Offshore dollars kept increasing in supply as well. As soon as exchange controls were eliminated, the foreign sector began rapidly redeeming ever-increasing dollars for ever-decreasing U.S. gold reserves. Reserves fell from 20,000 tons to 9,000 tons very quickly. That was the instability of the system; the U.S. gold reserves constantly fell during its implementation which rendered the ever-growing currency supply less and less backed by gold:In 1971, President Nixon defaulted on the promise of gold redemption and ushered in the era of fiat currency. Many people blame him for that particular moment, but the uncomfortable truth is that the system was unstable from its inception and full implementation. There was no mechanism in place to constrain the supply of new currency creation, either from the government itself or by banks and their lending activities, despite the fact that the currency was backed by gold.In 1974, the dollar was flailing, but the United States had by far the largest economy and military, and thus had resources to fix it. The world had never been on a completely unbacked currency system all at once, so this was a new experiment.The Nixon Administration  to backstop the dollar and reinforce its existing network effect worldwide. In this arrangement, Saudi Arabia would only sell its oil for dollars, regardless of who it was selling to, and would invest many of those dollar surpluses into U.S. Treasuries. In return, the U.S. would keep the agreement a secret (close association with the U.S. had troubling optics for Saudi Arabia so shortly after the 1973 Yom Kippur war) and would supply arms deals and regional protection for Saudi Arabia and their oil exporting infrastructure. This spread to the rest of OPEC, and the United States kept the dollar at the heart of the global financial system.Most countries hold U.S. Treasuries as reserve holdings, and most developing countries rely on dollar-denominated financing (which is often lent to them from non-American sources, like European, Japanese, and Chinese lenders, in addition to American ones). In addition, most FX trading volume involves the dollar (currencies tend to get traded for dollars and then traded for other currencies, rather than traded directly), and a large percentage of international contracts are denominated in dollars.However, this current system is unstable as well, in two ways.By reinforcing the dollar as the most salable currency with the deepest and most liquid capital markets, it attracts a strong monetary premium. Usually, currencies weaken when a country runs a trade deficit for too long, and strengthen when a country runs a trade surplus for a while. However, the U.S. dollar has a big extra monetary premium on it, which means it is stronger than it otherwise would be based on the U.S. trade balance. We therefore run trade deficits for decades straight, and the system doesn't correct itself as most currencies would have done by this point:To put it another way, in order to supply the world with dollars, the United States needs to be in the . And we do that via structural trade deficits.The extra foreign demand for our currency strengthens our import power and weakens our export competitiveness, and so dollars continually flow out of the country to the rest of the world in the form of trade deficits. The rest of the world then takes their dollar surpluses and buys U.S. assets with them. They used to buy mainly Treasuries, but now they also buy equities, real estate, private equity, and other American assets.The U.S. therefore has a deeper and deeper negative net international investment position, meaning that foreigners own more U.S. assets than Americans own foreign assets.A way to describe this is that the United States sells its appreciating capital (stocks, real estate, credit, etc.) in exchange for depreciating assets (electronics, industrial parts, raw commodities, etc.) in order to fund its trade deficit and maintain global reserve currency status, and the imbalance is unstable and thus keeps getting worse.The prior point applied mainly to the United States, but this point applies to the U.S. and most developed countries. Sovereign debt levels relative to GDP keep increasing.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker stabilized the dollar by sharply raising interest rates (along with the geopolitical maneuverings of getting OPEC nations to heavily invest in dollars in exchange for protection and arms deals). He was able to do this at the time because debt levels were quite low after so much inflation and defaulting and negative real interest rates.This ushered in a four-decade trend of falling interest rates and rising debt levels. Whenever the U.S. economy ran into a slowdown, monetary policymakers would provide liquidity and cut interest rates. Fiscal policymakers would also generally provide stimulus.The falling interest rates allowed for higher and higher debt accumulation without causing an acute problem, because interest expense remained low. If you double your debt level but cut your interest rate in half, for example, then your interest payments are unchanged. The United States benefited from that trend for forty years, and so countless calls for there being too much debt in the system came and went without issue. It lulled people into thinking the system was marginal or stable.However, when interest rates bounce off zero and start going sideways-to-up, while deficits and debts keep growing,  a problem. The instability of the system begins to reveal itself.The United States now pays more money on its interest expense than it does on its entire military. The mid 1990s to the early 2020s saw a great moderation in interest expenses, and this coincided with the opening of the Soviet Union and China and consequently a large period of disinflationary globalization. That period is over now, both because we bounced off zero interest rates, and because the world has become more multipolar and adversarial.In a , billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones described the U.S. fiscal situation as follows:Here's an image of the unbounded instability from the Congressional Budget Office, and this assumes that interest rates remain pretty low (it only gets worse if they remain high):However, I differ from Paul Tudor Jones in terms of how I see this playing out in the years ahead. In the interview, Jones frequently said the United States is going to have to raise taxes and cut spending to get the fiscal situation under control. I view that as being very unlikely to happen in today's polarized political environment.-Republicans are likely to hold firm against tax increases.-Democrats are likely to hold firm against cuts to entitlements.-Most entitlements are inflation-adjusting. Social security is indexed to inflation, and Medicare expenses go up with the cost of healthcare.-Military spending is unlikely to go down given the recent geopolitical situation. The U.S. is now financially involved in two war fronts, Ukraine and Israel, with Taiwan always a possibility as well.-Tax receipts are highly correlated with asset prices in the United States because our economy is so financialized. Any fiscal actions that attempt to raise tax revenue but that dampen asset prices are likely to offset themselves.So, in the long run, I expect this to lead to persistent above-target inflation or waves of inflation punctuated by temporary disinflationary slowdowns, driven by large monetized fiscal deficits.Currently, the Federal Reserve is trying to keep monetary policy tight to rein in inflation. High interest rates are having mixed results, as they slow down bank lending but also increase the fiscal deficit by quite a bit when debt levels are over 100%, which is stimulatory. They are, however, also reducing their balance sheet.They're able to decrease their balance sheet because, during their 2020-2021 stimulus, a huge reverse repo facility was built up. This can be thought of as a pool of excess liquidity that can be used to buy T-bills as they are issued. The liquidity in this reverse repo facility is now being used up and sent back into the rest of the financial system, and at the current rate will be drained in eight months or so:Bank cash levels as a percentage of total assets are also back down near their post-2008 effective limit. Ever since the March 2023 banking crisis, aggregate bank cash levels have been managed by policymakers with various tools to remain flat rather than keep going down as they were in 2022. Large banks could still draw down cash a bit more, but overall, there's not a lot of room here.If the Fed finds itself in a position in 2024 where the reverse repo facility is drained and it has to stop decreasing its balance sheet and perhaps start increasing its balance sheet even if inflation levels are still above target, that could cause quite a change in market perception about the Fed's ability to keep inflation under control. The market could collectively realize that the Treasury's deficits are in control, not the Fed because someone needs to buy those Treasuries and keep the Treasury market functioning with decent liquidity.From the 1990s through the 2010s, the world had a disinflationary ""peace dividend"" from the economic opening of China, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the resulting acceleration of globalization that ensued. Western capital and eastern labor were united, resulting in a huge increase in manufacturing in Asia. Russia began increasing its oil and gas production and supplying large amounts of cheap gas to Europe. As a result, unstable fiscal policies were easier to maintain, thanks to so much disinflationary pressure and new abundance, and the falling interest rates that this disinflation enabled.In the 2020s, that era seems to be over. Large deficits and money supply growth are more likely to be ""felt"" quickly because there are fewer disinflationary offsets going forward. Technology will continue to provide some disinflationary pressure in the white-collar world, but the blue-collar world (energy, commodities, manufacturing, and trying to duplicate supply chains and make them more resilient) is likely to contribute to an inflationary backdrop, with uncontrolled fiscal deficits and the inability of central banks to deal with them with their policy tools, since their tools were designed to deal with excess bank lending, not excess fiscal deficits.When I talk about unstable financial systems up to and including the sovereign level of the developed world, it can come off as quite bearish. It sounds almost ""doomy"".But it's important to remember that big monetary changes have happened before. Every few generations the system resets itself and starts something anew. The period of change can be disruptive, but on the other side, something comes out that is either better or worse, depending on how we all work together to shape it. To use the control system analogy again, the metal ball is picked back up and put back in the electromagnet control system.As a matter of perspective, I got back a few weeks ago from living in Cairo for a month and a half. My husband and I have family and friends there, and so we spend part of each year there. Egypt has less than $4k GDP per capita and was dealing with 37% record official inflation while I was there. And unfortunately, they are likely going to face another currency devaluation and a wave of inflation within the next year.And yet life... went on. People went to work. Kids went to school. Restaurants were full. Roads were packed. It's hard there, but people are hustling. You wouldn't guess that inflation was 37% by looking around. Life looks similar to how it looked last year, the year before, the year before, and so forth. The cracks are underneath the surface.There are dark places out there where society fully breaks down. Incentives around the production of goods and services fall apart, people go hungry, and people flee. Fortunately, most countries are able to stabilize before they hit that type of situation, but it's always a risk.Those of us who are in some of the wealthier parts of the world should be grateful for our good fortune. Some of the worst financial situations in our countries are like a normal year in some of the poorest countries in the world. Things that seem unimaginable in the developed world happen all the time in the developing world.I have a long-term positive view on gold and bitcoin given the prospect of fiscal problems ahead, but I also like T-bills, TIPS, oil producers, select real estate, select equities, and so forth. The past few years have been difficult for a lot of investors to navigate financially, with all sorts of ""unprecedented"" things happening that would have sounded crazy to someone in 2019. I expect the same will be true for the rest of the decade. We live in interesting times, but life goes on.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

OPEC+ Mid-Month Update: Saudi And Russia Are Serious On Reducing Supplies,"I had to do a double-take when I was going through these numbers. This is just a mid-month update, so the figures are likely going to be different. But it's important to know that if crude exports are this low for theFirst of all, according to Kpler, the first 15 days of August are showing a dramatic drop in crude exports from OPEC+.Most of this decline is coming from Russia.There are a few important points we need to figure out first. How much of Russia's crude export is to buyers following the sanctions and how much of it is not?In July, China and India accounted for ~2.6 million b/d out ofThe price cap was set at $60/bbl, so the decline in crude exports could be the result of prices breaching this cap. In addition, we also know based on the communique that Russia is finally starting to target crude exports. Will volumes finally revert back to the average around ~4.3 million b/d? Quite possibly, and if so, this means structurally lower OPEC+ crude exports going forward.Saudi's crude export decline this month is following the playbook. We originally thought that Saudi crude exports would fall to the ~5.8 million b/d range following the ~1 million b/d voluntary cut announcement. This looks to be materializing.With another 1 million b/d set to take place in September, global oil-on-water will continue to trend lower, and if Russia's crude exports remain below ~4.5 million b/d, then we have the tailwind for much higher oil prices.Over the ensuing weeks, oil-on-water will lead the charge lower. Assuming the same thing for everything else, Saudi and Russian crude export cuts over the next 45 days will take away 67.5 million bbls from the market.This will put us where that red dot is on the graph (lower right). As you can see, if the momentum continues, then this will put us at the lowest oil-on-water level over the last 5-years.This, combined with what we talked about yesterday (strong refining margins), should usher in tighter physical market conditions and higher oil prices.Don't fight the Saudis, and in this case, also don't fight the Russians. Both countries seem very determined to increase oil prices via lower supplies. We are seeing the conviction via the export data. As a result, we should see the oil market further tighten in the weeks to come.It's just economics.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, ""."" Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering . Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks. If you are interested, we can help!

China Curbs Exports Of Battery-Making Graphite As Global Tech War Escalates,"Citing national security concerns, Beijing said onUnder the new restrictions, China will require exporters to apply for permits to ship two types of graphite, including high purity, high-hardness and high intensity synthetic graphite material, and natural flake graphite and its products.Meanwhile, it dropped temporary controls on five less sensitive graphite items used in basic industries such as steel, metallurgy, and chemicals.China dominates global supply chains of graphite, the raw material essential for EV batteries. Graphite demand is expected to riseThe EU listed natural graphite as a critical raw material in 2020. The US also considers it to be a critical and strategic mineral.Beijing’s move comes days after Washington tightened controls on exports of semiconductors to China, including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by Nvidia ().The EV supply chain has become a source of escalating feud between Beijing and the West. Last month, the European Union said it was weighing levying tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidies.China dominates the global supply chain of critical minerals needed to make EV batteries, from material processing to the construction of cell and battery components. This is a result of Beijing’s early push towards electrification, particularly through subsidising EVs.The curbs are similar to those placed in August on , key metals used to make semiconductors and electronics.Exports of the two metals had surged before the controls went into effect but have fallen in recent months. Meanwhile, prices outside China have increased.China is the world’s top producer and exporter of the mineral. It also refines over 90% of the world’s graphite into the anode material used in EV batteries. Top buyers of graphite from China include the US, South Korea, Japan, Poland and India, Chinese Customs data shows.Graphite can be found naturally or produced synthetically. Natural graphite is the mined graphite, which is then processed into an end-use product that can be used in the battery industry.Natural graphite is primarily mined in China and Mozambique. Synthetic graphite is produced by utilising a carbon precursor product, typically petroleum coke, needle coke or coal tar pitch, and made into graphite through a process called graphitisation.A natural graphite anode generally benefits from smaller costs and lower energy consumption than a synthetic anode. But synthetic graphite is popular thanks to its higher purity and most lithium-ion batteries rely on it these days.Other countries that mine graphite include Brazil, Mozambique, Russia, Madagascar, Ukraine, Norway, North Korea, Canada, and India.In 2022, China took the top spot by mining 850,000 tonnes of the mineral, accounting for 65% of the global total. Brazil came a very distant second with 87,000 tonnes while other countries mined significantly less, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).Africa has been a recent focus for graphite exploration, with projects under development in Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, and Tanzania.Ukraine and Russia were among the top 10 producers of graphite before the conflict, according to USGS. In February last year, Ukraine halted graphite production.Operations resumed in August, however future production is uncertain as the conflict continues. As well, many countries have suspended trade relations with Russia, which has removed supplies of Russian graphite from much of the global market.Graphite is the largest component by volume in an EV battery. It makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode) material in lithium-ion batteries, in varying natural and synthetic combinations.In lithium-ion batteries, graphite cannot be substituted as it helps improve electrical conductivity and acts as a host for lithium ions. Cathode, the other half of the battery, constitutes lithium, nickel and cobalt.Graphite prices are likely to rise, but China’s latest move will also intensify the need to find alternative sources of this key battery material and push production out of China.Although China produces more than half of the global supply, but looking at global reserves, China is not the only option. Turkey takes the top spot (27%), followed by Brazil (22%), with the two countries owning half of the world’s natural graphite resources. China comes third at 16%, according to data from the USGS.Some EV manufacturers have already moved to diversifying supply chains away from China. Earlier this year, Tesla () signed a supply deal with Australia’s Magnis Energy Technologies (), which produces graphite concentrate in Tanzania.Meanwhile, graphite consumption is expected to continue to increase, owing largely to growth from the EV market. A total of 14% of all new cars sold were electric in 2022, up from around 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020.Global  10 million last year alone – and this level of growth isn't expected to slow any time soon, with almost one in five new cars sold worldwide this year set to be electric.The battery end-use market for graphite has grown by 250% globally since 2018, according to USGS. Besides EVs, graphite is commonly used in the semiconductor, aerospace, chemical and steel industries.The energy transition has become a pillar of policy for many governments, while global trade and political tensions have prompted a reconsideration of global supply lines.The global incidence of export restrictions on critical raw materials has increased more than five-fold in the last decade. In recent years, about 10% of the global value of exports of critical raw materials faced at least one export restriction measure, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).China’s graphite export restrictions are just a part of the global trend, with several other countries having taken greater control of their resources. Chile nationalised its lithium industry earlier this year, while Indonesia banned exports of nickel ore in 2020.We believe the rise in resource nationalism could slow down the pace and increase the cost of the energy transition, impacting the scale of investments, supply and prices. Meanwhile,  will continue to play an increasingly large role in the future of EV supply chains.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

"Energy In, Tech Out","As you know, the tech sector is largely responsible for driving the market higher this year on a strong bounce-back in the sector's financial performance after being pummeled by the 2022 bearYet over the past few weeks there has been a rotation out of tech and into the energy sector. Indeed, over thePrior to the last three years, the energy sector was arguably the worst sector in the entire market for over a decade. Yet despite the energy sector's strong performance over the past three years - and being the direct beneficiary of Russia's conflict with Ukraine that arguably broke the global energy (and food) supply chains - the XLE is still a relatively unloved sector. I say that because today the XLE ETF makes up only 4.5% of the S&P500 - roughly half of its weight in 2010 ().As a result, and despite the excellent run in energy stocks over the past three years, the sector is arguably still a value: According to , the XLE ETF currently has a TTM P/E of only 8.3x and yields 3.67%, both of which are very attractive as compared to the broad S&P500 ( and a yield of ).There's currently a very dynamic and relatively complex push-pull going on between the tech and energy sectors. This week, and over the past month, the momentum traders behind the energy trade have been winning. Today I will discuss the factors behind this dynamic push-pull and what investors can expect going forward.A globally traded commodity market like oil and gas is impacted by a variety of factors that can have a complex relationship with each other and on prices. My followers know, I have long considered the price of oil to be the dominant factor with respect to inflation - and we know that the rate of inflation can directly impact interest rates. We also know that U.S. interest rates can impact the value of the U.S. dollar which in turn impacts the foreign currency translation (""FX"") on the revenue of technology companies that generate a significant portion of sales overseas. That being the case, let's take a closer look at how these considerations impact the push-pull dynamic between oil (i.e. energy stocks) and the tech sector. I'll start with oil because it's the main determinant of inflation in my opinion, and which, as I will later explain, directly impacts the valuation of technology stocks.Despite the false narrative that the world is somehow facing a shortage of oil supply, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, as I explained in a previous Seeking Alpha article, we live in an . The U.S. shale fracking revolution has resulted in 10s of billions of bbls of  oil and gas reserves that can be easily and very profitably drilled (with a near 100% success rate) and brought to market within a couple of months over existing pipeline infrastructure. In addition, we have elephant discoveries like offshore Guyana while the oil sands of Canada have abundant bitumen reserves (a whopping  worth).As I pointed out in my recent  on the Fidelity Energy ETF (), Exxon () grew its Permian and Guyana production in Q2 by a whopping . Exxon is well on its way to achieving its ultimate goal in Guyana: Deploying six FPSOs, or Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessels, by the end of 2027 in order to bring Guyana's production capacity to more than .In Q2, Chevron () grew its Permian production to  or +11% year-over-year. As the slide below from its  shows, Chevron has an inventory of more than 6,600 drilling locations in the Midland and Delaware Basins and plans to grow production to well over 1 million boe/d by 2030 and then will hold it at that level for at least a decade:ConocoPhillips (), the No. 3 largest US O&G producer, has one of the largest Permian leaseholds and had Q2 Permian production of . - that's up from  in Q2 of last year (+12%).Meantime, on the natural gas front, last year the U.S. quickly ramped up natural gas production to replace cut-off Russian supply to the EU. As a result, last year the U.S. became the world's  Which, as I have pointed out, proved that shale actually still is a ""short-cycle"" resource - just as energy company CEO's had been marketing it to be for over a decade (that is, at least until President Biden asked them to raise production on account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and $120/bbl oil). Currently, United States domestic natural gas production is at an all-time high and so is total United States petroleum production.The point here is that despite the popular narrative that the U.S. is somehow not energy independent or that somehow President Biden would ""kill the energy companies,"" nothing could be further from the truth.That said, obviously shale reserves must be actually be  in order to ultimately impact supply and price. But after the ""lost decade"" of pitiful returns in the energy sector, when the idiotic ""drill baby drill"" mantra caused over-production into an already over-supplied market, the shale producers have discovered discipline and are spending $10s of billions on emphasizing stock buybacks instead of drilling - and in many cases, even over giving shareholders a fair shake on the dividend (i.e. like with Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips). The fact is, as high as U.S. oil production is today, it could be considerably higher with relatively modest increases in the cap-ex budgets of the major players.Meantime, as the chart below from  shows, Canada has nearly doubled oil production over the past 20 years:Meantime, Saudi Arabia recently announced it would continue its previously reported  through September. Reuters quoted an unnamed source as saying Saudi's cut may be ""extended, or extended and deepened."" Shortly after that announcement, Russia jumped on board by saying it would cut oil exports by  bpd in September. As a result, and combined with previous OPEC+ cuts, those countries are keeping multiple millions of bpd off the global market.So,  - so that isn't the problem. In my opinion, the problem is we are still burning too much of it and, as a result, quite literally burning up the planet as well.But of course as long as oil demand is strong and can soak up the current (restrained) production, prices will be strong too. From that standpoint, U.S. consumers responded to significantly lower gasoline prices this summer to demand more gasoline as compared to last year:In this week's , we found out that:Speaking of the SPR, it currently has 348 million bbls, up from 347 million last week but down significantly from 470 million bbls one year ago (see ). Net-net, according to  total U.S. crude oil inventory according is down significantly over the past three years:Meantime, the EIA reported last week that global oil demand is set to expand by an estimated 2.2 million bpd to , with China - the world's No. 1 oil importer - accounting for more than 70% of that growth. And just yesterday, the U.S. and China agreed to  between the two countries (from 12 to 24). That will result in additional jet-fuel demand in a global travel market that is already quite robust.The bottom line when it comes to global oil supply and demand: Restrained supply by U.S. shale producers and OPEC+, a significant drawdown in the U.S. SPR last year to mitigate the worst impacts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and combined with a general global recovery in oil demand has led to a tightening global oil market and a higher oil price. As a result, and predictably, oil company stock prices have risen inline along with the higher price of oil:Last year, the price of Brent crude skyrocketed to over $120/bbl after Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion, and its huge and negative impact on the energy and food supply chains, resulted in boosting inflation - which was already high and rising from the pandemic - even higher. In response to seemingly runaway inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to begin increasing the Fed Funds rate (see chart below). That resulted in a strengthening U.S. dollar and a wicked bear market sell-off in the tech sector due to the combination of a strong FX headwind that would reduce bottom line profits for big global tech companies, and due to expectations of lower demand due to the potential of an imminent recessionary macro environment.I know the chart below is somewhat busy, but it shows the interplay between these variables quite nicely:Starting from the left, you can see that Brent (in purple) was leading inflation - as measured by the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") in orange - higher. Tech stocks were still doing well because the thought process at the time was that inflation was transitory because pandemic-induced supply change disruptions were finally beginning to resolve themselves after vaccines were made available. However, starting at the beginning of 2022, you can see that Brent crude (and CPI) began to rise as tension rose over Ukraine. The tech sector - represented by the XLK ETF in green - began a sell-off that only accelerated when the invasion actually took place in February and which caused Brent Crude to temporarily jump to over $130/bbl.President Biden, after being rebuffed by U.S. shale producers and supposed ally Saudi Arabia, responded by releasing significant volumes of oil from the SPR. In parallel, the EU's natural gas supply chain was totally and surprisingly quickly reconfigured away from Russian supplies, and the price of Brent began to fall. And CPI eventually followed it lower. That led investors to think the worst of inflation was over and to the big tech rally over the first six months of this year. However, on the far right of the chart above, you can see the turn higher that oil began on July 1. You also can see the beginning of a drop in tech stock shortly afterward.Last week's  came in at 0.2%, as expected. But while energy prices are down 12.5% yoy, they're rising and no doubt investors are watching it very closely. Shelter was 90% of the inflation number, and is still a serious problem. On a yoy basis, July CPI rose 3.2%. That compared with an expected 3.3% yoy rate. While that is progress, it's still above the Fed's target rate of inflation (i.e. 2%). Still, the U.S. Dollar Index (shown below) rose for the week. I consider the DXY index to be an anticipatory indicator as it typically moves in advance of expected developments. Regardless of whether that theory is right or wrong, clearly the strengthening of the index last year was a primary factor in creating an FX headwind for global tech stocks that was a primary catalyst for the bear market.For example: Note that in  (the quarter ending Dec. 31) Microsoft () reported diluted GAAP EPS that was -11% yoy, but +2% in terms of constant currency. In other words, FX was a 13% headwind to MSFT's bottom line earnings primarily because the value of the U.S. dollar peaked at the end of the year (see chart above). Due to the U.S. Dollar's fall since then, MSFT's  diluted EPS faced only a 6% headwind. That being the case, if the price of crude oil rises, and the rate of inflation rises along with it (which it no doubt will), the market will start pricing in additional increases in the Fed Funds rate. That will likely cause the U.S. Dollar Index to strengthen again. That will lead, once again, to a stiffening FX headwind for the tech sector and a subsequent revaluation of their discounted future cash flows going forward.We're already seeing expectations of this scenario playing out. Broadcom () - one of my favorite technology holdings - recently broke through its 50-day moving average after an AI-fueled rally. Once through the 50-day, AVGO hit quite an air pocket on the way down:I find the interplay between the global energy markets and the U.S. tech sector to be both complex and fascinating. Currently and clearly, crude oil supply/demand fundamentals and various geopolitical and macroeconomic considerations favor the energy sector over the tech sector - at least in the near term. Momentum traders have obliged with an ""Energy In, Tech Out"" strategy.That said, my followers know that I advise them to build a well-diversified portfolio and hold it through the market's up-n-down cycles. They also know I feel it's critical to have exposure to both the energy and technology sectors, albeit for different reasons: Energy for income and a hedge against inflation, tech for excellent growth and long-term wealth accumulation.With that in mind, a title of ""Energy In, Tech Out ()"" may have been more appropriate for this article. I say that because long-term investors would make a big mistake to go overboard energy and to exit tech. Consider this:The fact is, and despite the newly found discipline of U.S. shale companies, higher crude prices are typically met with increased supply. That said, I do expect the second half of this year to be very strong for the energy sector. But stick with the oil producers and refiners (like Phillips 66 (), which is just killing it on high diesel crack spreads - see the previously referenced article on the FENY ETF for details - and not the natural gas producers. I say that because there's an abundance of natural gas, and despite growing U.S. LNG export capacity, pure-play natural gas producers are faced with growing associated nat gas volumes from Permian shale producers that are targeting oil. In addition, older shale wells simply get gassier over time - and the U.S. has thousands of older shale wells. See .Meantime, higher gasoline prices will likely motivate consumers to only accelerate the transition to EVs - of which  already are booming (which, I would note, is a boon to the semiconductor sector).On the tech side, the recent sell-off could continue for a while longer and result in giving investors who have heretofore missed much of the tech rally a second chance to get into some of the higher-quality companies. I say that because:I've been reporting on some of these trends on Seeking Alpha. For instance, in the article , I reported that Google continues to be a FCF machine and generated $21.8 billion in FCF in Q2 and a FCF yield of 29.2% of total revenue (up a whopping 11 percentage points yoy). GOOG ended Q2 with $118 billion in cash and has a forward P/E of 23.3x. False predictions that ChatGPT was somehow going to kill Google Search pushed GOOG stock down into the low $90's back in February (I added to my position). Any significant pullback in GOOG (say under $110) in the current ""correction"" would be a gift for investors who have yet to establish a position in the stock.The previously mentioned article on Google also cleared up the false narrative that somehow migration to the cloud is no longer a primary catalyst for the hyperscalers. That is simply not the case - AI being one big reason why. Meantime, note that widely followed tech analyst Dan Ives agrees with me that any pullback in tech stocks will likely be  So, get ready to pounce. Indeed, Broadcom already is very attractive in my opinion: It has a forward P/E of only 19.7x and - after being one of the best dividend growth stocks over the past decade (if not  best) - pays out an $18.40 annual dividend good enough for a 2.2% yield. Meantime, CEO Hock Tan noted the impact of the  during the :Bottom line: Let your energy stocks run. If you want to take some profits in order to reduce your exposure at the top of a cycle, you will likely get a great chance over the next few months. For tech stocks, it's just the opposite: Prepare to pick up shares at bargain prices. I'm not as upbeat on Apple () as I'm on equities like Google, Broadcom, the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (), and the Fidelity MSCI IT ETF () - all of which I expect will grow faster than Apple over the next year or two.Lastly, and to put thing into a broader perspective, I'll end with a 10-year total returns chart comparing the Energy XLE and its two biggest components (Exxon and Chevron), with the tech XLK and a few leading tech stocks and funds:As you can clearly see, long-term investors that bought and held tech through all the market's ups-n-downs over the past decade have been very well rewarded and done much (much) better than O&G related equities. Odds are that will be the case for the coming decade as well.  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

Chevron Offers Smoother Ride In Any Oil Market,"Owning energy stocks can be like riding a roller coaster with no idea of when the ups and downs will come or how long they will last.While leveraged exploration and production companies provide the most thrill, the reasonablyThe forward price-earnings ratio of 12.1 is way below the S&P 500 () ratio of 19.1. This lower multiple is typical of oil and gas stocks, which have been out of favor due to volatility and climate change concerns.The shares are in the middle of their 52-week range and sell for less than the Morningstar fair value estimate of $172.The chart shows that except after the COVID-19 oil bust of 2020 when free cash flowChevron management assumes a 12% return on capital at a base price of $60 realized barrel, far below recent prices. The company can operate normally even when Brent crude is at $50, executive vice president Nigel Hearne said:With interest rates rising, the market has been punishing companies that need to finance their growth. Chevron has a sterling balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio below 15 percent, the lowest among the largest U.S. oil producers:After backing out cash, the net debt ratio is only 7%. Why is this important? Because oil prices, while in a multi-decade upward trend, fluctuate widely. Any company that knows where and how to stick holes in the ground can make money when prices are high. But companies with a strong balance sheet also benefit when prices are low, by buying distressed competitors.An example of Chevron's capital discipline is how it withdrew from its tentative deal for Anadarko Petroleum in 2019, allowing Occidental Petroleum to take the bidding war (with Warren Buffett's assistance) rather than pay a price it viewed as excessive. The company came out of the deal with a .But, when prices and valuations collapsed in 2020, Chevron was quick to buy Noble Energy, with complementary assets in the Permian and DJ basins, for only .Contrast that with Exxon Mobil's () recent deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion. With PXD having 2.4 billion barrels of proven reserves, that works out to nearly $25 a share. Obviously, a lot of other factors besides reserves go into a valuation, but the difference of 500% can't be ignored.While the 2021-22 rise in oil prices led to an S&P-leading rise in Occidental shares over that period, Chevron stock has still done better since the 2019 battle. And that's the point--owners of Chevron don't have to time the oil price cycle correctly to profit in the long term.Chevron is the only U.S. oil company that holds a waiver from U.S. sanctions to produce in Venezuela. The Biden administration is negotiating to reduce sanctions in return for some semblance of a return to democracy. According to Bloomberg,  to drill new wells in 2024.Venezuelan production is particularly profitable at the refining end because the country produces the heavy grades of crude that Gulf refiners need to balance out the light grades and even lighter condensate that comes from fracking in the Permian Basin.The draining of U.S. crude inventories since the COVID peak in 2020 becomes clear when one takes the weekly Energy Information Agency figures and adds the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as done here:Oil prices depend on factors outside U.S. control, such as Saudi policy and Mideast war fears. Still, given the tight domestic supplies, the more likely direction for oil prices is up when seasonal driving demand resumes next spring.The company plans to increase production at a compound annual rate of 3% through 2027. It has profitable opportunities in the Permian Basin, Colorado's DJ Basin, Argentina, the Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere, but limits its expansion through capital discipline. It expects a free cash flow of $5 billion a year by 2025. Upstream earnings per unit are expected to grow 50% at flat prices over the next five years, .Chevron has a forward yield of 3.62%, which is lower than others in the sector mainly because its stock is valued more highly. It has made raising dividends its top financial priority, with 36 consecutive years of increases, one of only two energy companies along with XOM on the .In a recent , CEO Mike Wirth said the company has raised dividends at a compound annual growth rate of 6% for the last 15 years, including a 6% rise this year. ""Our dividend growth per share has been double that of our closest peers.""Since oil is a cyclical business, CVX manages to keep the dividend growing in downturns by keeping a lot of cash on hand and adjusting its capital return by reducing or eliminating share buybacks when necessary. This year, swimming in cash from last year's high prices, the company  to $17.5 billion a year.The main short-term risk is a decline in oil prices due to a weak economy, as during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. The process was self-correcting, however, as drilling reductions quickly followed and demand rebounded.There is plenty of political risk, ranging from government actions that would stop production in Venezuela to  expansion to a war-induced  to . The company has decades of experience managing risks and is diversified enough that any single crisis doesn't make much of a change in the overall outlook.The biggest risk is a global move away from oil and gas as the climate-change energy transition continues. The International Energy Agency believes demand will peak by the end of the decade, but OPEC vociferously disagrees and .My view is that increases in the standard of living of lesser-developed countries will more than offset consumption declines in industrialized nations. In addition, growing tensions between the U.S. and its allies and the China/Russia/Iran axis will cause both sides to not make dramatic reductions in fossil fuel consumption that could endanger their economic output, often a decisive factor in wars.Energy transition risks are also mitigated by the company's pledge to invest $10 billion by 2028 in carbon capture and greenhouse gas reduction projects.A long-term chart shows Chevron's total returns have been comparable to those of the S&P 500 ETF Trust () and much higher than the Energy Select Sector SPDR ().Chevron is a long-established compounder of cash flow and dividends. It is not the most high-flying stock to own when oil prices rise, but is able to take advantage of bad times to build its reserves. It's one of the few energy stocks one can keep under the pillow and not worry about losing sleep.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Chevron Is Better Than Cenovus,"I had to stretch to rate Cenovus ()() a ""Hold"" in my last Seeking Alpha article (see ). But I shouldn't have… I should have gone with what IThe investment thesis for the oil sands producers is relatively simple and straightforward: Before the era of shale oil (i.e., light-sweet crude), U.S. refiners assumed that they would be heavily dependent on heavy crude imports from Venezuela and OPEC for many years into the future in order to meet domestic demand for gasoline, diesel, and distillates. As a result, they reconfigured their refineries to run a larger slate of heavy crude. That slate included Canadian oil sands crude, which were effectively landlocked with pretty much all export capacity going south to its energy-hungry neighbor, the US. Indeed, Phillips 66 () imports more Canadian oil sands crude than any other company and, as a result, has a generally higher distillates yield vs. its peers.Today, of course, growing U.S. shale production has overwhelmed domestic light-sweet refining capacity and pretty much all the incremental production increases of shale are now being exported. Indeed, according to RBN Energy (see ), U.S. crude oil exports are currently running at ~4 million bpd with the vast majority being shale barrels and a relatively small percentage originating from Canada in the form of WCS:This is that many ""analysts"" - and especially politicians on the right - don't understand when they say ""America is no longer energy independent."" They point to U.S. foreign oil imports and somehow reach the conclusion that ""America is not energy independent"" when just the opposite is true: America is the largest oil producer on the planet, became the No. 1 LNG exporter on the planet last year, and is the No. 1 overall petroleum producer in the world. What these politicians and analysts don't seem to understand is that the American refining industry is all about efficiencies and optimizing your feedstock to run as profitably as possible given the configuration of your refinery.So, Canada has a ready market for a large portion of its heavy crude production, and any leftover can potentially be exported from the U.S. Gulf Coast, as most all of it shown in the graphic above (in pink) was. However, U.S. refiners pretty much have all they want and need. So it's not a big growth market. For growth, the oil sands producers - including Cenovus - have put all their organic production growth hopes in the Trans Mountain pipeline, which last I knew is scheduled to go online early next year with an extra 590,000 bpd of badly needed (and long overdue…) oil sands exit capacity (see ).Meantime, Cenovus' best asset might well be the WRB 50-50 refining joint venture it has with Phillips 66. ""WRB"" stands for Wood River/Borger, two refineries that are owned and operated by Phillips 66. The distributions from this partnership are likely what kept Cenovus out of bankruptcy back when the oil sands glut in western Canada had the CEO - the one they hired after the one they fired (for making the big oil sands acquisition from ConocoPhillips ()…) - running to the government for production cut mandates. In retrospect, it's quite humorous to consider what a novel idea that was: A CEO of a North American energy company asking the government for a production  mandate. Regardless, the point is - as I have been saying on Seeking Alpha for years - the best way to play the oil sands is not through the oil sands producers: It's through the refiners:From a big picture perspective, the slide below from Cenovus'  summarizes the company's assets:As you can see from the graphic, Cenovus is very much an oil sands centric producer (76% of production) and has upgrading (i.e., to WCS) and refining capacity that's roughly in line with its production (248,000 bpd with WRB alone). The company has a very large oil sands 3P asset base (i.e., bitumen) with a reserves' life of three-plus decades.Chevron, on the other hand, has a global asset base that's much more diversified and includes excellent exposure to the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, the global LNG markets via Australia (Gorgon and Wheatstone) and Angola, a growing and impressive footprint in the Eastern Mediterranean natural gas market, and . In Q3 Chevron pumped  from the Permian Basin alone. That was up 11% year-over-year and was almost as much as Cenovus' total production. Chevron plans to ramp Permian production to over 1 million bpd by 2025 and keep it there for at least a decade.Chevron also has 1.7 million bbls of refining capacity (primarily in the U.S. and Asia) and a strong presence in the global chemicals market via its 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, which is called CPChem, i.e., the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.The following chart summarizes the free-cash-flow profiles of the two companies over the first six months of 2023:Clearly this is a short-term comparison, and free cash flow can be greatly impacted by a variety of factors from quarter to quarter. However, in general, what you see above is a major reason why Chevron has greatly outperformed Cenovus over the past decade: It's a much more efficient and profitable company with, in my opinion, a superior asset base.And this is why Chevron has delivered much better dividend growth as well. The chart below shows the 10-year track record of Chevron vs. Cenovus:As you can see in the chart, Chevron's quarterly grew by ~50% over the past decade to the current $6.04/share on an annual basis. On the other hand, Cenovus' quarterly dividend actually declined by 41% over the past 10 years and the current payout is only $0.56/share annually. Indeed, during 2020, Cenovus suspended its dividend completely (i.e., $0.00) for three quarters in a row.From a debt perspective, to my knowledge no leading O&G company has a better balance sheet than Chevron (if you think one does, please let me know). CVX ended Q2 with $9.6 billion in cash, long-term debt of , and a net debt to equity ratio of only 7%.Cenovus had $1.6 billion in cash at the end of Q2 and long-term debt of . With a recent ratings upgrade, Cenovus is rated  by Fitch. Chevron has an .Being an oil sands producer that is still dependent on the U.S. export market, and the fact that Cenovus is competing with other big oil sands producers (i.e., Suncor (Suncor Energy Inc. (), Imperial Oil (), Canadian Natural Resources (), etc.) for pipeline exit capacity to reach that market, the discount of WCS (Western Canadian Select) to WTI is important. And, as we have seen in the past, the WCS-to-WTI discount can swing wildly. Indeed, sometimes the price of WCS can reach near $0 during gluts:Currently, the discount is ~ (WTI=$79.20/bbl, WCS=$62.14/bbl). As they say, ""all barrels are not created equal.""Lastly, what would you rather own in the era of ESG and global warming: Oil sands assets like Cenovus, or a company like Chevron that produces a ton of light-sweet crude and cleaner burning (natural gas) LNG?Chevron has a superior and diversified global asset production portfolio as compared to Cenovus, which is still a primarily and oil sands producer. That said, Cenovus has expanded its refining capacity which today roughly equals its total production. Still, Chevron is a much more efficient company with a higher free cash flow margin and a much better long-term track record of delivering dividend growth. That being the case, any investor thinking of buying Cenovus stock should consider buying Chevron instead. And any investor that holds Cenovus in a qualified retirement account (i.e., won't face any tax-selling consequences) should sell CVE and put the proceeds into Chevron.I'll end with a 10-year total returns chart of the major oil sands producers as compared to some major shale oil producers and the S&P 500. As you can see, Cenovus - along with peer Suncor - is at the very bottom. Shale oil producers like EOG, COP, and CVX significantly outperformed the oil sands producers:  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

"Energy Transfer: Some Compelling Narratives, But Not A Compelling Buy","The stock of Energy Transfer LP (), an operator of a vast and diversified pool of energy assets, has a number of sub-plots working for and against it. In this article, we’ll highlight two important sub-plots, and then closeEnergy Transfer’s EBITDA comes from 8 different sources, but the segment we’re most enthused by is the segment that focuses on the transportation of NGL (Natural Gas Liquids) and Refined Products. Last year, it was the second largest contributor to annual group EBITDA, but this year (as of H1) it has become the top contributor, accounting for of ET’s total EBITDA.In H1, this segment saw impressive EBITDA YoY growth ofSecondly, the surge in the export of ethane propane, and other NGLs from America should not be underestimated. Domestic propane inventories may be at record highs, but what’s key to note is that close to of this gets exported. This year we’ve seen a few producers resort to production cuts, and that too has limited the supply of propane inventories in the international market (besides being a byproduct of natural gas production, propane is also sourced during crude oil refining). As a result, US propane exports have gone through the roof (see image) and could stay elevated all through this year.The trend of ethane exports is another shining light and should reflect well on this division’s numbers. Note that in H1, ethane exports out of the country averaged barrels a day, translating to solid growth of 22%, but as recently as September, ethane exports were hitting levels of over barrels a day. We don’t believe this is just short-term euphoria either; the EIA believes the country could continue to export at this 500k rate through the end of FY24.Readers would also be interested to know that ET management recently stated that they are in discussions to lock in close to of the aggregate ethane volumes that will come into the system over the next 3-4 years.It's also rather well known that ET is relatively well insulated from the capricious nature of commodity prices, as its contracts are predominantly long-term and fee-based, but what’s also key is the dominance of take-or-pay transportation contracts, particularly in this segment. Currently, ET is benefitting from some very strong volumes, but even if volumes were to slow for some reason (which is not the base case), these contracts demand that payments be made to ET regardless of whether a fixed volume is transported.To flourish and build scale in this business, management needs to exercise good judgment with capital and leverage, and even though the jury is still out, it's fair to say that things are better than where they were a few years back.At the start of last year, Energy Transfer had intended to only deploy $1.575bn-$1.8bn by way of growth CAPEX, but primarily on account of the Lotus Midstream acquisition this year, further investments will also be made there, pushing up the overall figure. All in all, growth CAPEX for the year will likely come in within a higher range of , and the long-term plan is for the company to push the CAPEX runrate closer to $3bn p.a.We understand that this likely ramp-up in CAPEX won't please all stakeholders of ET, but we feel investors should be less skeptical in questioning the capital allocation and financing decisions of the management, particularly in light of some of the improvements engendered in recent years.Firstly, we bring to attention the manner in which ET has been financing its growing asset base in recent years. A couple of years back, around 53% of the asset base was being financed by debt; however, this has consistently crept down since then and currently stands at around 45%.It also helps that ET's assets are now generating some useful FCF (which in turn puts less pressure on the need for external funds), something it was barely managing to do during the pre-pandemic era.Admittedly ET still has a hefty sum of  of total debt on its balance sheet, and some of you may be wondering how best placed the company looks in a higher interest rate environment, but do note that as of H1-23, only 10% of its total debt consisted of floating rate debt.Note that as a function of EBITDA, ET’s target debt level range is , and hitting the lower end of that range, is something they intend to do very soon. If that happens, investors have another added reason to feel more encouraged as you could see the company recommence its unit buyback activities, something which has gone dormant since. For context note that the company still has around $880m of funds that could be authorized towards this endeavor.Even though we can find plenty of reasons to appreciate the well-rounded business of Energy Transfer, we are not necessarily convinced that this is the right time to kickstart a long position in the stock per se. Here’s why.Let’s first look at ET’s long-term price imprints on the monthly chart. Since dropping to the pandemic lows of sub $4, the stock has done well to make up lost ground by trending up in the shape of a rising wedge pattern. However, the issue with a rising wedge pattern is that it typically signs the increasing possibility of a after an uptrend.Now, an inverted V-shaped reversal in the price action may not necessarily come to fruition, but we do think the possibility of sideways movement has increased, rather than another strong move higher.We say this because firstly, the share has not resorted to any major pullbacks since the start of 2022, rather there’s just been a pause for a brief while followed by another upward leg. Secondly, also consider that the stock has now revisited the old congestion zone which coalesced from Q2-2016 until Q3-2019. During this period ET had just chopped around within this zone lacking direction; don’t be surprised to see the stock take another breather here.Then, prima facie, relative to most other alternatives a +9% yield is something to behold, but this should also be contextualized relative to what unitholders have typically received. Even though the recent distribution growth came in at an impressive rate of YoY, the uptrend in the stock has been such, that the current distribution yield falls short of the 4-year average by around.You also want to be getting into a stock when forward valuations are well below the long-term average, but with ET that is quite the opposite. Currently, the stock is priced at a forward EV/EBITDA of 7.4x, close to the peak of its 5-year valuation range, and 8% pricier than its 5-year average.We wouldn’t be averse to paying this premium if the degree of EBITDA growth over the next few years was strong enough, but data from YCharts show that EBITDA CAGR through FY25 will come in at an unremarkable pace of a little over 2%.Gauging insider sentiment towards a stock across different periods can also sometimes provide slight insight into what management thinks about the share’s current valuation. Well, in that regard, what we can see is that aggregate discretionary purchasing in Sep had come off in a big way from levels seen in August, and in the current month, there have been no purchases whatsoever.The other thing to note is that even though ET primarily appeals to the retail cohort, there’s also ample participation from the institutional segment (40%), the guys with deep pockets, who often drive big moves in the stock.If one looks at the size of the candles all through this year, one won't find too many large-bodied candles, implying the lack of institutional participation, and that's further reiterated by the data which shows that they haven't really participated in the rally this year, and have not shown any inclination to add to their positions all through this year. In fact, on a YTD basis, the net shares owned by institutions are down by over 15%. Granted, these guys don't always get things right, but yet still, when the institutional positioning is moving one way and the price is moving another way, one should perhaps pause and think twice.Finally, also consider that ET is unlikely to benefit from any rotational interest in the energy infrastructure MLP space. Note that the relative strength ratio of ET as a function of AMLP is currently trading well above the mid-point of its 7-year range, and is also not too far from hitting levels from where the ratio has previously pivoted.

Exxon Mobil: Why The Pioneer Deal Is A Game-Changer (Rating Upgrade),"Exxon Mobil () last week announced a major acquisition that is set to make a huge impact on the company's production business, especially in the Permian, a basin that is known for delivering strong production growth and high marginsI previously rated Exxon Mobil a hold due to OPEC+ members, mainly Russia and Saudi Arabia, supporting petroleumThe Pioneer acquisition comes at a time of rising prices as well as  related to the conflict in Gaza... which could benefit petroleum and gas prices and also help Exxon Mobil achieve short-term earnings and free cash flow gains. Since I see the acquisition of Pioneer favorably, I believe a rating upgrade to buy is justified.Exxon Mobil  last week to acquire Pioneer in a $60B all-stock transaction. Shareholders of Pioneer Resources are set to receive 2.3234 shares of Exxon Mobil for each Pioneer Resources share they own. The acquisition terms imply a takeover price for Pioneer Resources of $253 per-share, showing a 9% premium over the firm's 30-day volume-weighted average price.The transaction is transformational in the sense that Exxon Mobil expects to rapidly increase its production in the Permian basin... which is a key growth play for Exxon Mobil. Following the transaction completing, Exxon Mobil projects to double its output to 1.3M BOE/D. The firm has said it expects the closing of the deal in the first half of FY 2024. Additionally, the acquisition of Pioneer is set to add an additional 856,000 net acres in the Midland Basin, further boosting Exxon Mobil's production outlook: the firm said that it looks to achieve an annual production output of 2 MOEBD by FY 2027.The deal comes at a time when Exxon Mobil's production volume has dropped, chiefly because of asset divestments. So the acquisition of new productive assets in a high-potential growth basin like the Permian indicates that Exxon Mobil could see positive production growth going forward. Exxon Mobil's Permian and Guyana assets provided positive growth, in terms of production, in the second-quarter.The acquisition strengthens not only Exxon Mobil's Permian footprint, but its entire core production business which accounted for 57% of the firm's year-to-date earnings. The remaining earnings were distributed among Exxon Mobil's Energy, Chemical and Specialty Products businesses. The second-largest business, after production, was the firm's Energy Products segment which earned $6.5B so far this year and made a 34% earnings contribution year-to-date.The business combination of Exxon Mobil and Pioneer is also set to drive cost synergies which are expected to amount to $2.0B; which is additional money that could be returned to shareholders over time, either through dividend growth or share buybacks.Exxon Mobil is expected to earn $9.41 per-share in FY 2023, implying a 33% decline in earnings compared to the year-earlier period. The decline in estimates is largely driven by weaker petroleum and natural gas prices, compared to the year-earlier period, which have dropped significantly in the first six months of the year.Exxon Mobil is currently valued at 12.0X FY 2024 earnings while Chevron () has an earnings multiplier factor of 11.2X. ConocoPhillips () is trading at a slightly higher earnings multiplier (12.3X)... possibly because the firm is more dependent than its more diversified U.S. energy rivals on market prices for petroleum (ConocoPhillips does not own a refinery business). ConocoPhillips is a speculative buy for investors that believe that we are heading for a higher-for-longer oil price environment: .The biggest risk for Exxon Mobil, from a commercial perspective, is that petroleum and natural gas prices decline which would likely lead to significantly lower earnings, free cash flow and margins, especially in the production business which Exxon Mobil is now deliberately strengthening with the acquisition of Pioneer.I believe the $60B all-stock deal between Exxon Mobil and Pioneer is a game-changer for Exxon Mobil and transformative for the company's production business, especially as far as its Permian asset footprint is concerned: Exxon Mobil expects to double its production in the Permian following the close of the transaction and investors may see a return to positive sequential production growth in the all-important upstream business going forward.Exxon Mobil is also strengthening its core production business which still accounts for nearly 60% of year-to-date earnings for the energy company. The transaction is also said to yield synergy effects which could be used to return more cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Increasing fear premiums related to the conflict in Gaza may further benefit large-cap U.S. oil companies. Shares of Exxon Mobil are valued in-line with those of other large U.S. energy companies and I believe the risk profile has now further improved!   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

IXC: Right Sector But Global Allocation Is Challenged,"Energy and persistence conquer all things. - Benjamin FranklinInvesting in the energy sector can be a lucrative long-term strategy, especially since the underlying dynamics for oil in terms of supply are conducive towards outperformance for stocks in the space. TheIXC is designed to track the performance of the S&P Global 1200 Energy Index, which includes companies involved in the production and distribution of oil and gas. With 52 holdings, IXC provides investors with exposure to major energy companies from around the world.The top holdings of IXC includeIt's worth noting that this is still primarily a US fund (and that many US energy companies clearly have global operations anyway. Over 60% is US-based, with around 12% in the UK and 11% in Canada.Over the past five years, IXC has delivered decent returns, much of which is attributable to the post-Covid rally. Relative to the S&P 500 (), it still lags over the last 5 years, but momentum is clearly there in terms of overall strength.When we compare IXC to the energy ETF behemoth XLE, we can see that a global allocation to energy has been underwhelming. It has been far better to invest in Energy through the US than to dilute with anything outside our borders.While short-term market conditions may fluctuate, the long-term outlook for the energy sector remains promising. On the demand side, global economic growth and the increasing need for energy resources continue to drive demand for oil and gas. Despite the rise of renewable energy sources, oil and gas remain crucial in meeting global energy demands.Supply-side dynamics also play a significant role in the long-term outlook for the energy sector. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major oil-producing nations have a significant influence on global oil supply. By carefully managing production levels, these organizations can impact oil prices and create opportunities for investors.While the energy sector as a whole offers long-term growth potential, US energy stocks may present a better investment opportunity. The US energy market benefits from technological advancements, regulatory stability, and a diverse range of energy sources.The shale revolution in the United States has led to a surge in domestic energy production, making the country a leading player in the global energy market. As technology continues to advance, US energy companies are becoming more efficient and cost-effective in extracting and producing energy resources.Furthermore, the US energy market has weathered various market cycles and demonstrated resilience in the face of uncertainty. There is far more uncertainty when it comes to energy companies internationally by comparison.Investing in the iShares Global Energy ETF () can be a strategic move for investors seeking exposure to the energy sector. With its diversified holdings and global reach, IXC provides a comprehensive approach to investing in the energy industry. It's a good fund, but it's clear that for now the best way to access energy is by being in the US rather than by diversifying sector exposure globally. This could change, of course, but for now I'd rather consider more domestic exposure.Markets aren’t as efficient as conventional wisdom would have you believe.

The Dividend Investor's Natural Gas Export Playbook - Part 2,"Over the next 5 years, a multitude of natural gas export terminals are scheduled to commence operations. This will expand exported volumes of liquified natural gas () from roughly 14 BCF/d to over 26.5 BCF/day by 2030. TheA secondary round of projects that have reached FID will also serve to ensure these are not just one-off events. These supplementary projects will progress demandAs investors, this is an important market dynamic that can be captured for monetary gain. This can be done in several ways but also needs to be identified BEFORE the molecules start flowing.  focused on the producers of natural gas. Part 2 will focus on the midstream companies that will transport natural gas from the well heads to the export terminals.The midstream sector is ideal for income seeking investors due to its consistent levels of performance. Midstream companies help move molecules from point A to point B and charge a fee to do so. The business model in the midstream sector is usually fee based and structured with take-or-pay contracts that guarantee minimum levels of revenue. This has the benefit of insulating them from the swings in commodity prices.For a midstream company to experience growth, it needs to increase capacity to sell and increase volumes to fill that capacity. In this episode of my natural gas export series, we will look at two midstream companies that are building expansion projects to accommodate more molecules flowing overseas.This segment will be looking for stable and reliable income. Similar to my , I believe the midstream sector should hold roughly 30%-40% of one's energy portfolio. Here are my top two picks for this position.KMI made my list because it is already a front runner in the export game with greater than 50% market share in existing export terminals. KMI is obviously a natural gas dominated play with over 60% of its EBDA generated from the natural gas pipeline segment (KMI reports EBDA instead of EBITDA in its K-10 reports). The rest of its portfolio is supported by its refined products, terminals, and CO2 divisions.KMI currently supports a healthy 6.8% dividend. While it does not have quite the payout pedigree of a competitor like Enterprise Products, KMI has been . During that time, the quarterly dividend has grown from $0.125/share to its current value of $0.2825/share. That works out to be 7% average annual growth rate.A 6.8% dividend certainly makes KMI a viable option as an income producing asset. Let's take a look at how it stands to benefit from increased natural gas exports.KMI already services a bulk of the LNG export terminals that are currently in service, transporting a combined 7 BCF/d. The company is projecting a 50% increase in those volumes once the first wave of new export terminals comes online (targeted for 2H 2024). Beyond that, it is evaluating additional projects and contracts to supply the incremental increases that occur in the 2027/2028 time frames. KMI did not get into this position by mistake. It has the necessary ingredients that exporters want...connections and storage.Remember how I said the midstream business sells capacity? Just one look at KMI's asset map you can see that its system is connected to every major basin in the US. This gives flexibility to lean on other basins should weather or equipment issues disrupt service to ensure the molecules keep flowing.More importantly, KMI has the largest natural gas storage capacity of any of the big name midstream companies. Storage is a vital component of any natural gas network to ensure that adequate volumes are available during periods of extreme demand. In the same manner, export terminals rely on storage capacity to help meet their customers' needs should there be interruptions or higher priority customers upstream.It does not get advertised much but KMI has almost as much capacity as Enterprise Products, Energy Transfer, Enbridge, and Williams combined. This edge over the competition gives customers the confidence that KMI will be able to deliver. I summarized the capacity offered by some of the biggest midstream names in the table below using data from each company's annual K-10 report.Now that we have established a firm competitive advantage for KMI, what is KMI doing to build off this strength to capture more market share? KMI continues to invest in critical infrastructure to ensure its pipelines are the ones that the molecules flow on.These projects focus on the nearest basins, namely the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford. In the image below, you can see that these projects will direct over 4 BCF/d to the Gulf Coast, with a whopping 2 BCF/d dedicated to the Plaquemines export terminal.To bundle all this together we need to know one more fact. We need to understand what KMI can transport today so that we understand how much all of this will move the needle.In 2022, KMI transported a total of 39 BCF/d. Therefore, we are looking at a potential 10% increase in transported volumes from just four of the 12 projects currently in the KMI pipeline (shown below). This will translate into roughly 6% higher cash flows for the business and larger pools of FCF available for distribution once the capital expense of these projects rolls off the annual budgets.KMI currently sits at a debt level of 4.0x debt to EBITDA ratio. This sits somewhere in the 'average' zone, being a full turn higher than industry leader EPD. While net debt has reduced from $38 billion in 2016 to $31 billion in 2023, near term maturities over the next few years will cause some competing interests to develop.KMI has $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion worth of maturities due in 2024 and 2025 respectively. The firm has stated that it plans to stay in the range of 4.5x net debt to EBITDA so all signs point to refinancing of near term debt. The 'anti-debt' crowd may not enjoy this news against the backdrop of high interest rates, but I believe over the long haul this is the appropriate move.At the current clip of capital spending, the dividend consumes a significant amount of remaining FCF. So far in 2023, after also accounting for share repurchases, KMI only has  to pay down its debt. KMI would be forced to forgo pursuing projects that are necessary to maintain its advantage in the export market. This opportunity cost is too great. Ultimately, I believe investors will see a larger reward over the long term by growing the company at this time versus trimming down its debt profile.The midstream space is boring. And that is a good thing for income investors. We want growing and reliable income to be the cornerstone of the portfolio. That is the premier reason to have the portfolio weighted so heavily to the midstream space.The midstream model has shifted in the last 5 years for these companies, with a focus on organically funded growth to minimize the reliance on debt. Being capable of self-fund all growth projects without having to tap a bank is a huge selling point to investors.But the market only values these projects for their cash generation capabilities, and as a result, shares largely trade with yield. This effectively creates both a price ceiling and floor for the share price. As shown below, over the last three years, KMI and its peer group's share price have tracked their respective dividend. I like these charts to get a general sense of value as each company's income generating abilities grow over time.Buying when yields are starting to compress only means two things. Less income and higher capital risk. Conversely, as yields expand, investors are rewarded with higher incomes and less capital risk. With the dividend continuing to grow against a dropping share price and several promising projects in the pipeline, I view KMI as a buy.WMB doesn't have the same pure fit with the export industry that KMI does. However, its Transco pipeline is hard to match. The Transco pipeline is the headline asset for WMB, which deploys 10,000 miles of pipe to stretch from New York, down through the sunbelt and into Texas. This pipeline network accounts for .Having a major artery like this means that even if it does not supply the export terminals directly, it is a good bet that the molecules will travel through WMB pipe at some point on their journey from underground to the boat. More importantly, you can see the connection points between three large energy hubs. On northeast end of the Transco pipeline we have the Marcellus shale, on the Texas side we have the Eagle Ford. Snuggled up in the middle is the Haynesville shale.Again, sourcing and capacity will be key to growing its business a reap the benefits of new volumes associated with LNG exports. WMB has projects planned to further extend the capacity and connection points of this mega pipeline system.WMB has a lesser dividend compared to KMI, coming in at 5.3%. This dividend has been growing since 2016, at a rate of about . While this is largely unimpressive compared to some of the bigger names in the MLP space, we will see that WMB's balance sheet fundamentals will allow Williams to be a growth play in the MLP space.WMB obviously has an anchor asset in the Transco Pipeline. This flagship asset is one that can have a springboard effect for future growth. To extend the reach of Transco, WMB has 22 planned projects entering service between now and the end of 2025.WMB's major projects start at the key basins.1. The Louisiana Energy Gateway is being constructed to delivery 1.8 BCF/d from the Haynesville basin into the Transco pipeline.2. The Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway will expand the Transco connections in South Texas to increase volumes out of the Eagle Ford basin by 0.4 BCF/d.3. The Susquehanna and Utica expansion projects will boost capacity out of the Marcellus shale by approximately 0.45 BCF/d.The Louisiana Energy Gateway needs supporting projects to feed the massive 1.8 BCF/d pipeline. WMB plans to incrementally increase its gathering and processing capacity by using the South Mansfield, Mansfield, and Haynesville West projects for an additional 850 MMCF/d gathering capacity to help feed into the Transco main artery. These projects are scheduled to go into service in 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively.To wrap this up, let's again look at how much impact potential these projects have. We can conservatively estimate the major pipeline business to transport an additional 2 BCF/d and the gathering and process business to feed an additional 600 MMCF/d when all projects are in service. , WMB's average pipeline volumes was approximately 21 BCF/d while its gathering volumes exceeded 18 BCF/d. Working these volumes into the balance sheet, the six projects mentioned have the potential to lift earnings by approximately 5%.WMB stands at a slightly healthier position than KMI with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. It also has a similar maturity profile over the next several years. The major difference between KMI and WMB is the amount of unallocated funds remaining after paying the dividend and paying for capital projects.Over the , WMB generated nearly $2.9 billion in cash from operations. With $1.1 billion paid in dividends and $1.2 billion spent on capital expenses, $600 million remains to give WMB operational flexibility. This runs out to be $1.2 billion on an annual basis. While this could be deployed to reduce its debt profile, I believe investors would also be better served to devote excess cash to growing the business.WMB's debt structure also has a healthy cadence with no year in the 5 year horizon having any monumental balance due. This will allow WMB the opportunity to use its excess cash flows the opportunistically trim the debt profile.Similar to KMI, WMB's share price is lagging the current growth rate in the dividend. WMB has a smaller dividend than typical in the midstream sector but this also has its advantages. The excess free cash flow that is not earmarked for dividends and capital projects provides valuable flexibility.Management can use this flexibility to continue to accelerate growth projects or opportunistically retire debt without creating pressure on the balance sheet. WMB has the tools to grow its business to become stronger and leaner. Investors also get access to the largest natural gas pipeline in the United States. With the strong debt profile, slate of projects under construction, and ample excess free cash, I view WMB as a buy at current price points.In Part 2 of my natural gas playbook, we have explored two different midstream companies that are heavily focused on natural gas transportation. Kinder Morgan is already top dog when it comes to natural gas exports thanks to the connectivity of its system and vast storage capacities. KMI has several large products under construction to bolster its already leading position. Most notably, 2 BCF of additional pipeline capacity to feed the Plaquemines terminal when it comes online.My second candidate was The Williams Companies. WMB has the largest US natural gas pipeline in its Transco pipeline. This pipeline has the Eagle Ford basin on the Texas end, the Haynesville basin in the middle, and the Marcellus shale on the North East End. This connectivity from one pipeline is unmatched. WMB is growing the extensions of the Transco pipeline to boost connections to these basins as well as building bolt on gathering and processing projects.Both KMI and WMB will see additional earnings potential as volumes increase across their businesses. In Part 3, I will explore companies that run and operate export terminals.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Occidental Petroleum: Buffett Teaches Persistency And Patience,"The most recent discussion I had regarding  () , a period when the energy sector was struggling, and OXY's stock had been in a continuous correction phase since about why the greatest investor chose OXY over, say, Chevron () or Exxon Mobil () - you can refer to that article if you are interested in the answer to that question. Today I'd like to update myIn its Q2 FY2023 financial report, Occidental showed an adjusted net profit of $661 million or $0.68 per share, marking a significant decline from the same period in the previous year when it reported a net profit of $3.240 billion or $3.16 per share. Notably, Occidental's EPS  of both its own estimate of $1.15 and the consensus estimates:The decline in earnings was primarily attributed to lower realized prices for crude oil (down 32%), natural gas liquids (down 55%), and natural gas (down 78%). These price reductions more than offset the positive impact of increased production and reduced interest expenses. Sales for the quarter also saw a substantial decline, falling 37% YoY to $6.702 billion, missing the consensus forecast of $6.795 billion.Within its divisions, the Oil and Gas division reported a pretax net profit of $1.059 billion for Q2 FY2023, down from $4.094 billion in the same period of the previous year, primarily due to lower commodity prices. In contrast, the Chemicals division (OxyChem) experienced a 46% decrease in EBT, reaching $436 million, driven by declining polyvinyl prices, reduced product volume, and weaker chemical pricing. Meanwhile, the Midstream and Marketing segment reported a second-quarter operating loss of $30 million, a stark contrast to the $269 million EBIT last year, primarily due to derivative trading losses and unfavorable natural gas margins.Despite the challenges, Occidental's management  optimism based on better-than-expected production results in 1H FY2023. The company increased its full-year production guidance from 1,150-1,210 mboe/d to 1,185-1,235 mboe/d. Additionally, Occidental announced its projection for capital spending for the year, which is expected to range between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion, up from $4.4 billion in FY2022.On August 15th, we found out that OXY is set to acquire Carbon Engineering Ltd. for $1.1 billion in cash. Carbon Engineering specializes in direct air capture technology. This move should enable Occidental to advance and deploy DAC technology as a scalable and cost-effective global carbon removal solution, the . This purchase has generated quite mixed reactions, judging by the comments on this news. However, I think management is taking the right steps because, in the long run, I think the recent purchase positions OXY to play a more active role in mitigating its own carbon emissions and contribute to broader environmental sustainability efforts.Many also have some doubts about the debt load of OXY, as the company's leverage is much higher than that of most other companies. But in Q2 OXY showed improvements in its financial position with a total debt/capitalization ratio of 41.7%, down from 45.3% compared to the previous year. On the liquidity front, the company held $486 million in cash and cash equivalents, which was notably lower than the $1.362 billion reported in Q2 FY2022. Therefore, the situation here is really mixed.However, if we assume that high oil prices will remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future, I think OXY has a chance to continue growing despite its leverage.In its recent note on the energy sector [September 14, 2023 - proprietary source], Goldman Sachs mentioned an interesting fact that speaks not only for OXY but also for all representatives of the industry. The fact is that upcycles in oil last ~12 years on average and the current cycle started in 2020. Yes, things are moving fast these days - cycles have become more fluid (see the COVID crisis and how quickly we got out of it). But the last 3 years are too fast to solve all the problems that have been accumulating in the energy sector for years.We see how quickly OPEC countries react to any macro shift against them and how futile the U.S. attempts to lower the price of oil by releasing their reserves have proven to be. Yes, they may not need to be replenished to previous levels, but there is already enough demand in the market to keep prices high as far as I see. As GS analysts said, oil demand will grow to ~107 mn bpd by the end of this decade vs. ~102 mn bpd currently.Against this backdrop, the continued turnaround of the OXY business seems quite logical. The company continues to invest aggressively while focusing on distributing the remaining FCF to shareholders.Occidental Petroleum's assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Permian Basin, and the Middle East are of high quality, and if the market continues to create a favorable atmosphere for high oil prices - and so far all indications are exactly that,  - then the ongoing FCF should allow OXY to further reduce its leverage and buy back shares.If the potential turnaround succeeds - Goldman Sachs cites the successful example of Hess Corporation () - to catch up with its peer, I believe OXY's market cap could double:Certainly, my investment thesis carries several notable risks.Firstly, a significant portion of my rationale hinges on the assumption that the favorable commodity cycle will continue its bullish trend. It's essential to recognize that the resurgence of interest in the energy sector among investors doesn't guarantee its sustained success, and in the event of an economic downturn, it could revert to underperformance.Secondly, Occidental does bear a substantial debt burden. As pointed out by Bill Selesky of Argus Research on August 16, 2023 (proprietary source), maintaining low debt levels is prudent, especially in a rising interest rate environment. Currently, Occidental's debt-to-capitalization ratio stands at 42%, which is quite high. Moreover, he raises concerns about the strategic fit of the liquefied natural gas and offshore assets acquired from Anadarko within Occidental's portfolio. It's anticipated that it may take some time to realize sustained sales and earnings growth from these assets, according to Selesky's analysis. Thus, these factors underscore the importance of vigilance and careful consideration when evaluating Occidental's investment potential.However, in my opinion, OXY's valuation is now close to fair - this is confirmed by both the FCF yield (chart above) and the EV/EBITDA ratio for the next year:One of the most important things in investing is to be persistent and patient. These are the two traits that characterize the world's greatest investor - after selecting a company that he believes has good growth potential (or a great shareholder return), he makes an investment decision and only seems to change it when the company begins to perform adversely for him in terms of corporate governance. Judging by Buffett's recent actions, he hasn't changed his mind about OXY yet in my opinion. Given the potential for a successful turnaround, I'll not change my Buy rating this time either.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to !

"US expands Nvidia, AMD AI chip export curbs to some Middle East countries","The U.S. has expanded restrictions on exports of high performing Nvidia () and Advanced Micro Devices () artificial-intelligence chips to some countries in the Middle East.Nvidia said in a regulatory filing that in Q3 fiscal 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced license requirements, with""During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East,"" the company  in a SEC filing.The company noted that it does not expect these additional export restrictions, would have an immediate material impact on its financial results.Separately, AMD also received an informed letter with similar restrictions, Reuters  citing a person with knowledge of the matter who noted that the move has no material impact on the company's revenue.In addition, Nvidia said that the new licensing requirement ""doesn't affect a meaningful portion of our revenue. We are working with the U.S. government to address this matter,"" the report added.Last year, the U.S. government had announced several restrictions on exports, including a measure to cut off China from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment.More recently in August, the U.S. President Joe Biden  an executive order to  certain U.S. investments in China in the three areas of semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and AI.Several Chinese companies rushed to  Nvidia chips worth $5B which are important to make generative artificial intelligence, or AI, systems.Nvidia noted in the SEC filing that it has sold alternative products in China not subject to the license requirements, such as its A800 or H800 offerings.Reportedly, China is expected to  the first lot of generative AI services for public rollout this week.

BP: Oil At $90 Translates To Rating Upgrade,"I believe BP () is set to potentially benefit from soaring petroleum prices due to OPEC+'s recently announced supply restrictions that extend to the end of the year. Previously, I considered last year’s record prices to be aLike I said in the introduction, I thought petroleum prices peaked last year and with a sharpPetroleum prices rallied to a 9-month high last week after two OPEC+ countries announced major output cuts that deeply affected the market and led to new concerns over the security of energy supplies, especially with the winter season approaching rapidly. OPEC+ countries include oil-producing countries organized in the OPEC price cartel plus Russia.Saudi Arabia  that it will reduce production by 1M barrels a day until the end of the year, and Russia announced an additional 300 thousand barrel a day export reduction. The supply cuts will be in place until the end of FY 2023 and could be extended into the new year as well. The announced supply restrictions have already generated new concerns over global energy supplies, which resulted in petroleum trading back up to $90 a barrel. High petroleum prices obviously benefit major petroleum exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, but also multinational companies such as BP, which faces sharply improved earnings and cash flow prospects after output cut decisions were communicated to the market last week.Petroleum prices have been in a down-trend for BP and other energy companies, but the most recent decision could provide a crucial boost for BP's average prices in the third and fourth quarters. Petroleum prices dropped for BP in the second-quarter, although not as sharply as natural gas prices: the average petroleum prices declined 31% year over year to $69.19 a barrel, while weaker natural gas pricing impacted the average natural gas price by 67%.The uptick in product pricing, in response to OPEC+ supply cuts, indicates improved cash flow and earnings potential for BP, at least in Q3'23, but potentially beyond that.BP’s surplus cash flow, a measure of financial strength as well as stock buyback potential, was negative $0.3B in Q2’23, the result of sharply declining operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures in the second-quarter. BP's lower operating cash flow as well as declining surplus cash flow was chiefly driven by lower average prices in BP's petroleum and natural gas business. However, BP’s operating cash flow was solidly positive at $6.3B in Q2'23 and BP has a reasonable chance to report solid growth in its operating/surplus cash flows in the third-quarter.BP is currently valued at a P/E ratio of 6.8X, based off of an earnings estimate of $5.59 for FY 2024. This year's estimate implies a  in earnings per-share, but the current pricing strength in petroleum markets may result in EPS upward revisions. U.S.-based energy producers like ExxonMobil and Chevron () trade at earnings multiplier factors of 13X and 11.6X, so BP does have a considerable valuation advantage of its U.S. rivals. BP also recently  it was looking for a new Chief Executive Officer, which could further add upside momentum once the company fills the position. If BP traded at a P/E ratio of 8X, then shares of the energy producers could have a fair value around $45 which I consider to be a realistic price target.BP is focused on petroleum exploration, which means the energy company will continue to be exposed to changes in oil prices, and its earnings and cash flow prospects can be expected to remain highly volatile from one reporting period to the next. However, the risk of an earnings contraction has been reduced lately, resulting in an improved risk profile for BP's shares.The fundamentals in the petroleum industry have changed most recently with OPEC+'s aggressive supply cuts resulting in an upsurge in petroleum prices... which of course is improving BP's earnings and cash flow potential in the near term considerably. It also suggests that my previous opinion, which was based on the assumption that profits of petroleum producers peaked in FY 2022, may have been premature. Considering the improved risk-reward ratio for BP as a result of changing fundamentals in energy markets, I believe BP is going to be set for stronger than expected Q3 and Q4 results (in terms of average prices) and the firm may see EPS upward revisions. Supply cuts ahead of the winter season also send a bullish price signal to energy markets, and the search for a new CEO could also add new upside impulses for BP's shares!

Israel-Hamas War Brings Geopolitical Risks To The Forefront,"When I wrote my commentary last week, we were breathing a sigh of relief because the United States was able to avoid a government shutdown. But today, the near-shutdown is far in the rearview mirror - the Israel-Hamas War has shocked the worldOver the weekend, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing civilians and taking hostages, in what seems to be a reaction to the Israel-Saudi peace plan that is in the works. Israel has declared war and appears to be preparing for a wide-scale invasion of Gaza. Part of the Israel-Saudi peace deal was a pre-condition of Israeli concessions to Palestinians. This seems unlikely to happen in the current environment, which suggests the peace deal may be derailed. The There are many possible ways this crisis can evolve from here, but for the purposes of simplicity, I would suggest two possible paths for macro/market observers to consider: 1) the situation remains contained, or 2) other countries join the conflict.Now, Treasury yields could rise if we see a significant resurgence in inflation caused by the events in the Middle East, but it seems unlikely that we would see a major impact to global inflation. First, the real price of oil is already elevated, and it is hard to imagine anything like a tripling from today’s level (in 1973, prior to the Yom Kippur War, West Texas Intermediate oil was around $28 a barrel in today’s prices). The global economy is far less oil-intensive than it was at that time, suggesting the inflationary impact of any oil price rise is now proportionately less.In other news, the further rise of long bond yields is also worrying investors. The  from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) triggered fears that the US Federal Reserve would keep interest rates “higher for longer,” which in turn placed upward pressure on long bond yields. Recent better-than-expected US economic data has added to that upward pressure on yields, resulting in downward pressure on stocks.However, as I have said before, it appears markets are overreacting to the dot plot and the data. That’s because:Finally, I take comfort from comments made by San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly last week. She conceded to the reality that the rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield is doing the Fed’s work for it, which suggests the Fed can now be more dovish: ""the need for us to take further action is diminished because financial markets are already moving in that direction and they've done the work. We don't need to do it more.""Investors are also concerned about the health of various economies in the face of a global central bank-induced slowdown:Looking ahead, some of the most-watched data points this week will be the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), German industrial production, and German CPI. I will also be interested in the FOMC minutes, which will be released later this week.

Occidental Petroleum: The Advantages Of Leverage,"Occidental Petroleum () took full advantage of financial leverage through the acquisition of Anadarko. At first, this looked like an unmitigated disaster in fiscal year 2020 as oil prices went negative. Then it looked absolutely brilliant as oil prices careened past $100Admittedly there is a race of technology advances and operational improvements (as well as cost declines) against the timeNow, the company does not need quite as much in the future for that acquisition to come out ahead. Technology appears to be on track to provide a considerable profitability boost in the future. Management  the purchase of Carbon Engineering Ltd. Occidental already has one of the largest secondary recovering operations in the United States in the Permian Basin. As unconventional wells age, a lot of carbon dioxide is going to be needed to produce more oil through secondary recovery. Management is obviously already thinking about that (and that acquisition should increase the value of the Anadarko acquisition even more because more oil will be recovered).Favorable commodity prices always help though. Right now, it would appear that prices, as usual, are not acting as predicted. Instead, they are acting better. The more this happens during the early deleveraging process, the more likely the company will be able to demonstrate to shareholders the advantages of the acquisition.A large acquisition often needs five to seven years for the full benefits to become apparent. That can be disheartening to shareholders that want to see all the results yesterday. But it could also mean a very competitive company in the future with competitive benefits that were not available before the merger.The most obvious place of improvement is the well results.The  continues to at least (and probably exceed) escalating costs elsewhere in the upstream system. This is the kind of progress that brings more acreage into Tier 1 territory than was initially assumed at the time of the merger. It also makes the acquisition more valuable over time.Investors often wonder why company results do not reflect this progress where they can see it. The reason is that the established production still has the costs at the time of the well drilling. Those costs do not disappear simply because the latest well is so much better.That means that the reported results are a mixture of new and established production. It takes time for enough wells drilled the ""new way"" so that there are enough of them to report lower costs (and hence better profitability) corporate wide.Here is yet another basin where well performance is improving. Elsewhere, management mentions (for example) that wells are getting longer (where that is needed or desirable). There are some things going on that improve profitability and raise costs.As against that drilling is going faster than I ever thought possible and completion (both speed and design) advances also exceed my expectations.The real unanswered question is if the company is gaining against the competition over time. Management clearly has some first-rate results. But then again, they had that before the acquisition. Now the question remains if management can translate these gains into superior profitability in the future (above what is currently being reported).I personally think that they have a much better chance of demonstrating this in the D J Basin because Occidental is a far superior operator than Anadarko was. Therefore, the profitability improvement is likely to show itself in a place where Occidental really had no significant exposure before the merger.The whole second quarter message appears to be that the benefits of the merger and the leverage will be margin expansion at various commodity prices throughout the business cycle.A side issue is the upside potential as North America increases the ability to export natural gas to the world. Management  that oil is about 51% of total production. That would imply some upside potential as North American natural gas prices (and related liquids as well) join the considerably stronger world market prices.Some other considerations would be that the Chemicals division supplies the raw materials for plastic that are extremely important to the green revolution. The future demand for raw materials like ethane and propane appears to be very good. That could mean better prices in the future than was the case in the past.There will also be benefits from retiring debt and the preferred stock. Right now, the preferred stock retirement is the priority with debt being retired on an opportunistic basis.Management appears to be on-track to retire about one-quarter of the preferred stock in the current fiscal year. That is nothing close to the pace of debt retirement in the previous fiscal year. But it is significant enough to reduce the costs of preferred stock in the next fiscal year.Similarly, the ratings upgrade, if that continues (so that all the ratings are upgraded), has the potential to reduce future debt costs if refinancing is preferred to repaying debt.Occidental still needs some decent pricing to make progress deleveraging. Right now, the current market appears to signal that commodity prices will aid in that deleveraging progress. Technology improvements will likewise take some pressure off the leverage ratio in the form of better company profitability.There is always the danger of another cyclical downturn. But the longer it takes for that downturn to appear, the better financial shape this company will be in to make it through that downturn okay. Usually, the first few years are critical to the deleveraging process. That was why the pandemic challenges of fiscal year 2020 were a cause for concern.Now, after the benefits of fiscal year 2022, things look a whole lot better. The company can still use some decent future commodity prices. But the issue is not as necessary as it once was (especially after 2020).The proposed benefits of the merger with Anadarko appear to be on-track to be significant enough to become apparent to shareholders in the near future. But the overall question of the benefits of leverage compared to the risks (as to which dominated in this case) remains an open question.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience. He has been focusing on this industry for years. He is a retired CPA, and holds an MBA and MA.

June Non-OPEC And World Oil Production,"This month’s report is a shorter version of previous posts because the EIA’s Statistics update for June is not available. Information from other sources such as OPEC, the STEO and country specific sitesWhere STEO data was used, . The average for the last four months was used to project June, July and August production for a few countries.World oil production and projection charts are presented at the end of this post.The October STEO is projecting June Non-OPEC oil production to increase by 1,069 kb/dto 51,079 kb/d. Close to 500 kb/d ofUsing production data from the October 2023 STEO and the  EIA Statistics, a projection for Non-OPEC oil output was made for the period July 2023 to December 2024. (Red graph). Output is expected to reach 52,671 kb/d in December 2024, Note that production is expected to be relatively flat till May 2024.June  production, using the same method described above, is projected to increase by 863 kb/d to 38,179 kb/d. Again, close to 500 kb/d of this increase is associated with the upward revision to Russia’s June output. July 2023 production is projected to increase by 474 kb/d, the majority of which occurs in the later half of 2024.Brazil’s National Petroleum Association (BNPA) reported that output in June and July increased to a new record high. July increased by 146 kb/d to 3,513 kb/d mainly due to new project start-ups in the Pre-Salt layer, red markers. August production dropped by 51 kb/d to 3,462 kb/d.According to the October MOMR: the August drop is “mainly due to maintenance in the pre-salt fields.”The STEO is forecasting that Canadian production rebounded in June by 74 kb/d to 4,286 kb/d. Production continued to increase in July and August. The April and May drops to 4,212 kb/d were due to significant maintenance at the oil sands mines and upgraders.The China National Bureau of Statistics reported that production in August dropped by 124 kb/d from June to 3,986 kb/d.While China’s production growth has risen steady since 2018, it may be approaching its post pandemic high. Production then drops after these big increases. According to the STEO, Kazakhstan’s output increased by 65 kb/d in June to 1,879 kb/d. The STEO is forecasting that production decreased in July and August to 1,754 kb/d.Mexico’s production in June was 1,938 kb/d a decrease of 31 kb/d from May. Output dropped to 1,895 kb/d in July and rebounded to 1,940 kb/d in August according to Pemex.Mexico has recently revised its definition of condensate. This has resulted in the EIA adding an extra 60 kb/d, on average, to the Pemex report. The red markers include the additional 60 kb/d.The Norway’s Petroleum Directorate (NPD) reported that June’s production dropped to 1,781 kb/d. Production rebounded in July to 1,846 kb/d and then dropped to 1,805 kb/d in August. (Red markers).According to the : “Oil production in August was 1.0 percent higher than the NPD’s forecast and 0.2 percent lower than the forecast so far this year.”Recent production highs to 1,850 kb/d appears to be close to Norway’s post Covid production peak.Oman’s production rose very consistently since the low of May 2020. However production began to drop in October 2022. According to the October STEO, Oman’s June output dropped by 5 kb/d to 1,039. The STEO projects that production will recover in August after July’s drop to 1,037 kb/d.The EIA’s STEO report was used to project Russian output in September by reducing the all liquids output by 0.938 to estimate the C + C production. The 0.938 is a pre-war average of Russia Ministry production to the STEO all liquids production from October 2020 to September 2021. September production was 9,815 kb/d an increase of 28 kb/d over August, orange markers.Using data from , Russian production was estimated from April to September. For September, Argus reported that Russian  production was 9,500 kb/d, an increase of 30 kb/d, blue markers. Comparing the Argus crude data with the latest STEO projection indicates that the STEO estimate for Russian C + C is midway between the Argus estimates for Crude and C + C..World oil production in June, according to the STEO, increased by 1,263 kb/d to 81,416 kb/d (Green graph). As noted previously, close to 500 kb/d of the increase is due to an upward revision to Russian production.This chart also projects World C + C production out to December 2024. It uses the October 2023 STEO report along with the May International Energy Statistics to make the projection. (Red markers). and is 1,979 kb/d lower than the November 2018 peak. Note that it is not known how much of the increase is due to OPEC + reducing their voluntary production cuts.World without the US oil output in June increased by 1,057 kb/d to 68,516 kb/d. July’s output is expected to drop by 400 kb/d to 68,116 kb/d.  The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",79,2023-09-03T07:54:10.000-04:00
What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,"First and foremost, the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination. This article is not about politics, and it will not focus on what's right or wrong. Instead, we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent, as of this writing, are up ~3%, with WTI () trading above $85 and Brent above $87. Initially, at the close of Friday, WSJ published a report noting that the U.S. is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high. Soon after, Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel. If you want to thoroughly review the events, Some of you may wonder, what does this have to do with oil? Historically speaking, geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions. In this case, Israel is not a major oil producer, so what's the catch? The catch, in our view, has to do with Iran's potential involvement in this whole ordeal. WSJ published a piece noting that Iran's senior officials helped plan this attack months ago.While the U.S. has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet, it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on Iran.For starters, we need context to what we are writing. In June,  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market. Since then, IEA has confirmed via its figures that Iran's oil production is close to ~3.1 million b/d. Our supply & demand model assumes ~3.3 million b/d, and official Iranian figures support that production is around ~3.3 million b/d.Putting all of this together, Iran is exporting close to ~2 million b/d. Visible tanker exports account for ~1.5 to ~1.6 million b/d, while shadow exports account for ~400k b/d.Since H2 2022, the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports. As we wrote earlier in the year, this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storage.With floating storage gone and crude exports back to ~2 million b/d (~500 to ~800k b/d below the previous peak), what's the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward? Perhaps the U.S. does nothing and leaves Iran as is, but what probability would we assign to that?In my view, while the risk of a major loss is low, we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months. We think the average would fall from ~2 million b/d to ~1.6 million b/d. In terms of visible tankers, this means Iran's crude exports would drop closer to ~1.2 million b/d.While it won't be much of a decline, it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into year-end and possibly well into H1 2024.Looking at our latest supply & demand update, we made a few important assumption changes:In essence, global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by month-end. And if the U.S. starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports, then our balance could surprise to the upside. But with a deficit of ~2.2 million b/d, the lack of production decline from Iran won't make that much of a difference, either.On the other hand, with no mega deal on the horizon (between Israel and Saudi), the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases. Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis won't be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least $110/bbl. With Brent trading at $87, we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a reality.In conclusion, global oil inventories should accelerate downward. But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession. Fund flows will ebb and flow, so oil prices won't skyrocket anytime soon. Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception. Until then, we see prices grinding higher, with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levels.For readers looking to add energy stocks, Q4 will provide ample opportunities. We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil. Consolidation and M&A are heating up, so you will see more and more mergers announced. But more importantly, always remember that with these oil prices, the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist. Please be patient, fundamentals are on your side.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, ""."" Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering .

Occidental Petroleum: Warren Buffett And WTI Crude To The Rescue (Rating Upgrade),"We previously covered  () in June 2023, discussing the stock's uncertain prospects attributed to the decline in the crude oil spotThis had contributed to the stock price's decline below its critical support level, previously supported by  ()() average purchase price of $57s since March 2022.We had been previously skeptical about whether Berkshire's increasing stake in OXY had justified the highly buoyant stock prices from $30s to over $70s. Accordingly, we had rated the stock as a Hold (Neutral) then, preferring to err on the side of caution.For now, it appears that Warren Buffett has come to OXY's rescue again, by purchasing 2.14M shares at an average price of $57.25 in June 2023, puttingThe recent price movement has also mirrored the recovery of WTI Crude Oil and Natural Gas spot prices, both of which are important to OXY's average realized prices, and eventually top/ bottom line.Thanks to the  through 2023 (and potentially through 2024), the commodities' spot prices have recovered tremendously for the  by +16.9% to $79.61 per barrel and for  by +20.4% to $2.53 per Mcf. This is compared to the May 2023 bottom, going against the previous downtrend.These spot prices are highly encouraging indeed, higher by +8.1% compared to OXY's  of oil at $73.59 per barrel and by +86% to the average realized gas price at $1.36 per Mcf.This is an important development, since the producer's  of 1.21K MBOE/D (inline QoQ/ +6.1% YoY) is split quite evenly between Crude Oil at 628 MBBL/D (-4.7% QoQ/ +2.7% YoY) and Natural Gas/ Natural Gas Liquids at 590 MBOE/D (+5.1% QoQ/ +10% YoY).Therefore, while OXY's FQ2'23 performance may have been underwhelming, we expect things to improve in FQ3'23 and maybe even through FQ4'23, if the OPEC+ cuts are as restrictive as intended.This is on top of the producer's raised FY2023 production volume range to between 1.19M and 1.24M BOE/D, up by +1.6% at the midpoint, from the previous range between 1.175M and 1.215M BOE/D.The higher crude oil prices above the minimum  may also trigger OXY's intensified redemption of . This is because the ""8% annual dividend"" translates to an annualized payout  comprising 63.5% of its overall payout in FQ2'23.We may also see intensified common share repurchases, based on the  as of FQ2'23, with $3.69B already exercised over the last twelve months while retiring 59.5M of common shares.As a result of these developments, we believe that the producer's deleveraging may continue taking a back seat, though investors must also note that its long-term debts of $19.08B (inline QoQ/ -11.1% YoY) in the latest quarter has already been drastically moderated, compared to the peak levels of $48.39B in FQ3'19.These efforts demonstrate the OXY management's excellent use of the hyper-pandemic windfall across , intensified capital expenditure for production growth, balance sheet deleveraging, and expanded shareholder returns.For now, OXY's valuations have also reflected Mr. Market's optimism, with NTM EV/ Revenues of 3.03x and NTM Market Cap/ FCF of 8.56x, compared to its 1Y mean of 2.83x/ 6.60x and the oil/ gas sector median of 1.65x/ 7.98x.However, if we are to look at OXY's Enterprise Value to Proven Reserve ratio of 21.88x, based on its EV of $83.4B at the time of writing and the  of 3.81M barrels of oil equivalent [BOE], it is also apparent that OXY is still trading at a notable discount.This is compared to its US oil/ gas peers, namely Exxon Mobil's () Enterprise Value to Proven Reserve ratio of 25.1x, Chevron () at 27.4x, and Devon () at 20.87x.These ratios are based on XOM's Enterprise Value of $445.65B/ the  of 17.74M BOE, CVX's Enterprise Value of $307.78B/ the  of 11.22M BOE, and DVN's Enterprise Value of $37.78B/ the  of 1.81M BOE.Since the WTI crude oil spot prices remain elevated, there are inherent risks that the OXY stock may eventually retrace once the Fed is successful in tamping down the inflation to ~2%, bringing the commodity's spot prices nearer to the pre-pandemic levels of $60s.However, we are cautiously confident that the OXY stock may retain its support levels at $57s, attributed to Berkshire's growing  to over 25% by the end of June 2023, despite  to acquire the company.Based on its annualized Free Cash Flow generation of $5.69B in the latest quarter, the shares outstanding of 958.80M, and its NTM Market Cap/ FCF valuation of 8.56x, the stock trades near to its current fair value of $50.85 as well.Due to the attractive risk reward ratio, we are cautiously upgrading our rating for the OXY stock to a Buy, preferably between $57 and $60 in following Warren Buffett's cue.Long-term investors may continue dripping as well, depending on their dollar cost averages.

Alto Ingredients: A Corn-Powered Rocket Primed To Crush Earnings Estimates,"On May 2nd, I published  when Alto () was priced at $1.27. In the article, I highlighted how everything that could have possibly went wrong in 2022... did go wrong. Furthermore, I highlightedAs of market close on October 6th, ALTO has risen over 200% to $3.98, but still remains significantly undervalued, trading roughly equal to tangible book value, with multiple short-term as well as long-term catalysts.There are currently two analysts that cover ALTO and the mean estimate has ALTO reporting Q3 EPS of $0.10 at the beginning of November.These analyst estimates almost certainlyAs I explained in , anyone can track ALTO's daily Pekin corn bids (including basis) on their  and compare it to the price of  to estimate ALTO's daily crush margin where the majority of their ethanol production exists. ALTO management does not believe in hedging the price of corn, and it's very difficult to lock-in both corn as well as renewable fuel ethanol much past a few days; therefore, tracking the daily crush margin is an incredibly accurate method to measure profitability on a daily basis.As one can see from the above table, the operating environment has completely changed year over year. Furthermore, the average daily crush margin for ALTO has risen 150% in Q3 versus Q2! However, the current analyst mean estimate for $0.10 per share is exactly equal to what ALTO  of 2023.If we want to be super conservative we can reasonably assume that at the very least ALTO will report $0.20 per share of earnings; however, I think it's much more likely that ALTO puts up a figure close to $0.30 per share for a variety of reasons that extend well beyond just the crush margin at Pekin. In fact, earnings of $0.30 or more, a 200% beat compared to FactSet's mean estimate, is probable.Not only has the average crush margin rose 150% quarter over quarter, but corn oil prices in Illinois have risen from an average of $0.56 in Q2 to $0.68 in Q3 (an increase of >20%) based on  from Iowa State. This increase in corn oil prices (which occurred nationally, not just in IL) combined with ALTO's Magic Valley facility fully ramped-up with the CoPromax technology will result in a material increase to essential ingredient revenues. The Magic Valley facility is also likely to have benefited from protein sales from the technology as well even though we shouldn't expect that part of the system to be fully ramped until Q4.Need another source? On Green Plains' ()  they stated:Based off of the crush margin as well as the corn oil pricing, it is easy to see why ALTO will easily earn much more than the $0.10 per share that they earned in the second quarter; however, it gets even better.While perhaps not clearly communicated, the Columbia facility still had curtailed production in Q2 and was not running at full capacity due to demand constraints. From the , we can see that ALTO only produced 70.5M gallons of ethanol in Q2 vs 77.0M gallons in Q2 of 2022 (a 7% decline in capacity utilization). We should expect a huge increase in capacity utilization in Q3, because not only should all of the facilities have been fully operating for the entire quarter, but the Columbia facility also had a new market as Rob, the CFO, indicated on the :In short - not only will ALTO benefit from having the Western plants fully ramped, high crush margins, and high corn oil prices - ALTO will also benefit from being able to sell ethanol into the Washington State market at even higher ethanol prices due to the newly passed state legislation!What about forward looking guidance though? What if the market looks beyond Q3 and instead focuses on Q4? Fear not:The table above shows that as of the close of market on October 6th, ALTO's current crush margin is still over $0.50! Remember, we shouldn't expect ALTO to lock in future months; therefore, there is still uncertainty about what actual crush margins will be for the rest of October as well as November and December. However, as this forward-looking curve is the only tool available to management to provide any sort of opinion about the fourth quarter, it would be impossible to come to any other conclusion than an extremely enthusiastic and optimistic forward guidance.It should also be noted that specialty alcohol sales tend to pick up in the last half of the year and also tend to be higher-margin sales into the pharmaceutical market.Why is the renewable fuel crush margin so good? Is it sustainable?In essence, the demand for renewable fuel in the US has stabilized year over year, supporting the price of ethanol, while the price of corn (as well as corn basis) has materially fallen. The price of corn has fallen for a variety of reasons.First, Ukraine has found multiple workarounds (via both train as well as different water routes such as the Danube river) to get their corn harvest into international markets as the Russian/Ukraine war has dragged on an additional year.Secondly, Brazil had a record harvest and is exporting a record amount of corn internationally. This has both increased world stocks of corn while also making it more difficult for US farmers to find buyers in the international markets for their corn.Thirdly, despite drought risk at some points during the year, the US corn crop was able to get timely rains when they were most needed. The timely rains combined with a huge increase in the number of planted acres of corn has resulted in a fantastic domestic corn harvest. However, since cheaper Brazilian corn is flooding the international markets, there has been a massive decrease (a decline of over 30%) in exports of US corn year over year.Summarizing, ALTO is benefiting from both a decline in the price of corn due to a huge increase in world corn stocks as well as benefiting by the inability for local farmers to export corn internationally which is decreasing the basis (cash cost) that ALTO has to pay to have the corn delivered.The largest cost for ALTO outside of corn is natural gas. In the second quarter,  about 54% YOY at Pekin, and in the third quarter, natural gas prices were down over 60% YOY! The trend has continued into the fourth quarter with October down 60% YOY as well.ALTO management recently indicated at the  that they were locking-up a winter strip for natural gas pricing. Therefore, we shouldn't expect a repeat of the 4th quarter last year where ALTO was unhedged and hit by natural gas prices in the Western United States spiking from under $10/MMBtus to around $60/MMBtus!Clearly, Q3 earnings is a very near short-term catalyst for ALTO. However, there is the potential for additional short-term (as well as long-term) catalysts for ALTO in regards to Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The market clearly has not yet caught onto this segment of the market, but when they do, ethanol companies may begin to be materially re-rated as full-comprehension begins to take hold.The ""Inflation Reduction Act"" not only created huge benefits for ethanol companies to sequester carbon dioxide, but it also created huge benefits for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for both producers as well as consumers (the airlines).Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is simply aviation fuel that is made from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil or ethanol. The feedstocks are required to have extremely low carbon intensity scores; therefore, there is currently some uncertainty on the subject as it relates to ethanol. There is currently no definitive ruling from the Treasury / IRS on what calculation will be used to determine the carbon intensity scores for SAF feedstock. Per :I do not share the concerns or fears of the market that ethanol will be excluded. First of all, SAF demand is  by 2030 (5% of global jet fuel demand) and then grow over 26% annually through 2050. There is simply no way to meet this demand without ethanol as the supply capacity of verifiable used cooking oil as well as other potential feedstocks is extremely low. It would, quite frankly, be impossible to meet any SAF goals without ethanol as a feedstock. Last week, on October 3rd,  that ethanol would be part of SAF:This should have been huge news for the ethanol industry, but simply finding those comments from the DOE official was a difficult process. Therefore, the market is unlikely to begin taking this into consideration until it officially comes from the Treasury in an official statement. Therefore, a statement from the Treasury is an important short-term catalyst, and it is likely that the final ruling from the Treasury will be officially released by the end of October (perhaps mid-October).Why would the market begin to re-rate the entire ethanol industry based on this news?It takes about 1.9 gallons of ethanol to make a single gallon of SAF!Think about that... if SAF demand reaches 7 billion gallons by 2030 (just 5% of global jet fuel demand), it would take over 13 billion gallons of ethanol to meet that demand. According to the , the total ethanol plant capacity in the United States was about 17.6 billion gallons, in theory, (as plants would never run at full capacity on an annual basis). In actuality, the annual US capacity is likely closer to 16 billion gallons. The  currently requires ethanol blending levels of 15 billion gallons for 2023, 2024, and 2025.Do you see where this is going? How can 15 billion gallons of ethanol out of 16 to 18 billion gallons of ethanol capacity go into renewable fuel if meeting just 5% of global jet fuel demand with SAF would take an additional 13 billion gallons of ethanol? Global ethanol capacity is only 28 billion and the international plants will not have the benefits of being a low carbon intensity product as they do not have the same geological abilities to sequester carbon underground.Ethanol producers will instantly go from a commodity price-taker position into a price-maker position as demand for ethanol will skyrocket with zero possibility of possibly meeting the demand requirements for both SAF and renewable fuel.Therefore, not only will the ruling immediately benefit those ethanol producers that are instantly ready to provide low carbon intensity ethanol as feedstock into the SAF market due to having carbon sequestration, natural gas bypass, and co-generation already in place - It will benefit the entire industry as gallons are moved out of supplying renewable fuel.In fact, at the  in mid-September, Bryon McGregor (around the 14 or 15 minute mark), talked about how Archer-Daniels-Midland () has already announced that they are converting two ethanol plants into SAF facilities over the next couple of years which will represent a 700M gallon decline of ethanol supply available for renewable fuel.The rising tide will lift all boats. The price for renewable fuel ethanol will likely experience an exponential increase by the end of the decade as there will simply not be enough ethanol to meet the demands of both renewable fuel as well as SAF and the market just simply has not fully comprehended this yet.If you listen to the comments at the Wainwright conference (again around the 14-minute mark), you'll also hear management comments about how not only will the government provide $85 per metric ton of sequestered carbon (via the 45Q), but that product can currently be sold into California and Oregon at $85 to $135 per metric ton on top of that subsidy!The biggest risk facing ALTO would be another period of sustained negative crush margins. This could potentially be brought about by some sort of black swan event like COVID where everyone essentially stopped driving for months.The market may still have some lingering concerns over ALTO's ability to fund all of their growth initiatives, but two consecutive quarters (Q3 and Q4) of strong net income will go a long way towards dispelling these concerns. Additionally, ALTO management has consistently hinted towards some sort of funding mechanism for carbon sequestration that includes potential final customers of the low carbon intensity product. This could, for example, be some sort of partnership with an airline with a future need for SAF.Furthermore, something that many may have overlooked, is the ability to obtain grants for several of the projects. While management has not yet commented on this, there are plenty of sources that show that funding for things such as co-generation could partly be paid-for through Federal or State grants. If ALTO were to win one of these grants it would further reduce their cash needs to fund their growth initiatives.Finally, there is also a risk that something could happen at one of ALTO's facilities that results in the facility being unable to produce ethanol for a sustained period of time.In conclusion, ALTO has several near-term catalysts coming up that make it a strong buy for both the short-term as well as the long-term. ALTO may beat the FactSet mean consensus earnings estimate by over 200%! Any concerns over the ability of the company to fund their upcoming  should be completely non-existent after what is likely to be two consecutive quarters of strong, positive earnings.ALTO still trades right around tangible book value while GPRE trades at well over double their tangible book value. I expect that ALTO will narrow this valuation GAP with GPRE soon.An official ruling from the Treasury and IRS on the ability to use the GREET methodology to calculate SAF subsidies should begin to open the market's eyes to this incredible opportunity that will change the ethanol industry for decades and decades to come.It is clear that it will take an incredible expansion of ethanol capacity to meet the future demands for renewable fuel and SAF. Therefore, it is almost certain that the ethanol producers will become price-makers for decades upon decades until the market can find a balance. While not previously mentioned (perhaps anywhere), through my discussions with management I've been told that the Pekin facility could be expanded by hundreds of millions of gallons from the current 250M annual production capacity. Therefore, the future earnings potential of ALTO is materially higher than the $40M average EBITDA over the last several years, and  that the shares should be valued at $10+ to $20+ by 2026/2027 in a worse-case/base-case scenario with a 10x EBITDA multiple may now be too conservative.

Petrobras: The Best Way To Play The Oil Bull Market,"Petrobras () is a controversial company, but investors can’t deny that this stock has performed very well since my Since then, the company has recorded a strong Q2, and Brazil's political and economic situation continues toI think that PBR is a fantastic long-term hold, but I will say that, from a technical perspective, we could get a pull-back in the coming month.In this article, I'd like to touch on the Q2 results, recent developments in Brazil's economic and political situation and the oil market. These are essentially the key driving factors of PBR's price, which is why we must stay on top of them.Overall, I think the last few months have given us yet more evidence thatI maintain my buy rating due to the long-term potential and the juicy dividend.PBR is a part government-owned oil company in Brazil, and though many American investors have doubts, the performance speaks for itself.In my last two articles, I have talked about why I liked PBR so much, so let's review this really quickly and look at what has happened since my last report.Firstly, from a purely fundamental perspective, PBR is much cheaper than its competitors. Despite a very solid YTD performance, PBR trades at a PE of 3.2.This is well below what US oil and gas companies trade at. Of course, this discount can be attributed to the fact that this is a Brazilian company, and this is a country which has been struggling with low growth and inflation.But where others see risk, I see an opportunity. As I mentioned in my the Brazilian economy has been improving, and many of the risks associated with Lula may be overstated.Lastly, I defended that PBR would do well as oil prices increased in , and this is what we have seen.PBR is up nearly 35% in the last six months, and though you might think that the company is crushing it, Q2 was, as you’d expect, given the oil price at the time, not that impressive.The company reported $11.7 billion in required adjusted EBITDA, down almost 15% from the prior quarter. We can see the segment breakdown below.The biggest fall in revenue was in the Refining, Transportation and Marketing due to the 40% drop in international diesel crack spreads.Meanwhile, net debt climbed for the quarter, but as we can see from the panel on the right, the company has a very manageable load over the next five years.Key to my fellow income-loving investors is the new Shareholder Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the end of July.The company expects to pay out 45% of FCF, will include equity acquisitions in the formula, and may even carry out buybacks to increase shareholder return.On the surface, it looks like a decrease in the payout, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be once we include share buybacks. This gives the company some more flexibility while also committing a high amount of their FCF.Investors in Petrobras have to also keep a close eye on the company’s economy and politics. This is partly a partly government-owned monopoly, which does create a potential risk.With that said, since Lula’s appointment, the company has done well, and despite a lot of speculation on the matter, the president has not derailed this company’s trajectory. If anything, we have seen the opposite.In the last few months, we have seen a string of bullish news for the company. Just a couple of weeks ago, Brazil’s attorney general opened up the possibility of .Some might find this unexpected coming from Lula’s government, and the President did address this apparent “contradiction” in an interview.Source: This actually makes sense, dare I say? Brazil’s economy has been lagging for some time, and the president doesn’t want to cripple it, especially now that it is doing relatively well.Brazil has been , growing GDP 3.4% YoY and with unemployment falling below 8%, which is good for the country.And to top things off, following a very aggressive hiking cycle, the Brazilian Central Bank has now begun to cut, aggressively, starting with a 5Of course, the fate of PBR will depend on the oil outlook, and in my opinion, it looks quite good.From a fundamental perspective, we have the , at a time when the US’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves are at levels not seen since the 80s.From a technical perspective, I think the recent move off the lows is just the first impulse to take us back north of $100 barrel.I think we are just beginning a final impulse in a large-degree wave 5, which should end near the green target box.In the more immediate term, we could see a pull-back in prices, especially if the RSi enters overbought on the weekly.A slight sell-off from here in oil would also coincide with my current view of the PBR chart:We have a very clean diagonal forming since the 2020 lows in PBR, but we might be near the top of our wave five target.If we measure the length of wave 1 from the bottom of 2, we can see that wave 3 topped at the 1.272 ext at $11.92. This makes me think that the next leg up could end somewhere between the 1.618-2 ext, which is the green box.Again, I must reiterate that I like PBR a lot, and I am not looking to sell. If we did get to +$20 in the coming months, I might consider shaving off some of my position.While I am very bullish on PBR, let's look at what could go wrong.Politically, there is always a chance that the government will step in and curtail PBR's profit-earning capabilities. Yes, this is always a risk, and that is why PBR will likely never trade at the ratios of American oil companies. But so far, we have little evidence to suggest this will happen.On another note, PBR will, of course, suffer if oil prices take a hit. So far, dynamics in the energy market seem to suggest higher prices are likely, but this would change if we witnessed some form of global economic slowdown.China is facing some issues, no doubt, and so is Japan, and Europe is also showing some signs of weakness. A slowdown can't be ruled out, but I would still view this as a short-term headwind.All in all, I continue to see PBR as one of the best, if not the best, way to gain from the coming oil bull market. The stock is cheaply valued and positioned to benefit both from increasing oil prices and improvements in the Brazilian economy.Emerging Markets will be one of the key areas of growth over the next decade.My personal portfolio is positioned to benefit from this, and I carry out regular research on EEM stocks that I think will do very well in the long-term.Come check it out at James Foord is an economist by trade and has been analyzing global markets for the past decade.

Energy Transfer Selling Off Is An Opportunity Yielding 9.66%,"Energy Transfer () is having a strong 2023 as units appreciated from $11.62 to a 52-week high of $13.67. Units of ET are retracing a bit after earnings, finishing the week down -4.06%. ET has now missed I am pro-renewable energy, and I am invested in several renewable energy companies because they are projected to increase their percentage in the global energy mix over the next several decades. Why I see the opportunity in renewables, I am a realist and understand that eradicating oil and gas isn't probable over the next 20-30 years. I continue to read many different energy industry publications to understand current trends and future predictions. I continue to allocate capital toward energy infrastructure companies due to the information I will share from these publications:Over the past decade, there hasn't been a year where global oil production exceeded the amount consumed. In 2022 the global economy consumed 97,309,000 Bpd of crude while the production level was 93,848,000 Bpd. Natural gas has been produced at a slight surplus over the period compared to the deficit of oil produced. The U.S. is the largest oil and gas producer, producing 18.93% of global oil production and 24.2% of global natural gas production. When Canada is accounted for, an additional 5.94% of oil production and 4.57% of natural gas production comes online. This is the main reason why I am consistently allocating capital to energy infrastructure companies. There is 24.87% of the global oil production and 28.77% of the global natural gas production occurring in North America, and it all needs to be treated and transported.The 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids and natural gas will increase through 2050 in the U.S. The U.S. will also remain a net exporter of petroleum and liquified natural gas (LNG) products. If the U.S., which is the largest oil and gas producing nation globally, is projected to increase production and be a net exporter through 2050, the logical conclusion is that more takeaway capacity will be needed, and energy infrastructure companies will generate larger levels of distributable cash flow (DCF) as more fuel passes through their systems.In  completed its acquisition of Lotus Midstream for a combination of $930 million in cash and 44.5 million of newly issued units. ET added 3,000 miles of active gathering lines and 2 million barrels of crude storage. ET is projecting that the integration of Lotus will generate significant synergies between the companies and immediately enhance their ability to generate free cash flow and distributable cash flow. I like the deal because it provides ET with a bi-directional connection from the Permian Basin to Cushing OK, and adds capacity to other major hubs, including Midland.ET finished Q2 generating $3.12 billion in Adjusted EBITDA and $2.04 billion of DCF on a consolidated basis. $1.54 billion of the total DCF is attributable to the partners of ET. ET saw its NGL fractionation volumes increase 5%, midstream gathering volumes increase 8%, NGL transportation volumes increase 13%, intrastate natural gas transportation volumes increase 3%, crude transportation increase by 23%. ET guided that in 2023 we will see between $13.1 billion and $13.4 billion in Adjusted EBITDA, which is the largest amount from all the MLPs.For the past several years, I have discussed ET's strength in the exporting sector and why it was a strategic move for the company. ET has export facilities on the East and Gulf coasts with a large pipeline system that spans over 120,000 miles. ET recently signed  to sell LNG from the proposed Lake Charles export facility in Louisiana. The first deal that was announced was with an unnamed Japanese consortium for the purchase of 1.6M tons/year for a 20-year term. The 2 agreement acts as a middleman where Swiss commodities trader Gunvor would buy LNG from Chesapeake Energy () at a price indexed to the Japan-Korea Marker for 15 years. CHK would supply the Lake Charles facility with enough volumes of gas to produce 1M tons/year for 15 years; after liquefaction. The 3 deal is with an unnamed U.S. customer and involves a tolling arrangement for 1M tons/year for 15 years.The Lake Charles facility has come under question, and on the conference call, ET discussed this project at length. In May of 2022, ET received an extension from FERC on the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. The DOE denied ET's request for an extension for the commencement of exports and in April, denied ET's appeal placing this project in Limbo. We have now been informed that ET has been in discussions with the DOE and is filing a new application for export authorization. ET expects to file in August and, during the DOE's review, work with existing customers, prospective equity investors, and other stakeholders to progress the development of the Lake Charles export facility. Ultimately I believe that ET will be granted the authorization because commodities are too important to the U.S. in global trade, and there will be a continuous need for U.S. energy on the global stage.The Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. and international markets. ET has made a final investment decision on an expansion to its NGL export capacity at the Nederland facility to address increased demand. They expect the expansion to cost $1.25 billion and add roughly 250,000 bpd of export capacity. ET also is pursuing a project at the Marcus Hook facility that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity.I am bullish on ET's future because as the demand for energy increases, so will the need for ET's services throughout the value chain. ET generates incremental profits throughout every segment in transporting crude, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Exporting could be a critical differentiator between ET and the rest of the sector in the future and allow ET to grow even quicker. If ET gains the approvals from the DOE it will expand their exporting capability and should drive higher volumes through their infrastructure due to contracted exports.ET goes  on 8/11, and the current distribution is larger than before the cut. In the November 2020 distribution, ET made a -50% reduction from $.305 to $0.1525. Since the February 2022 distribution, ET has provided unitholders with 7 consecutive quarterly distribution increases, bringing the annualized distribution to $1.24. On the conference call, management indicated that they will continue to target a 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate.If ET grows the distribution at a 4% rate which is the midpoint of their guidance, the annualized distribution could grow by 17% by the 2027 distribution. Management reduced its leverage, acquired 2 companies, and provided 7 distribution increases, bringing the distribution above its prior levels before the cuts in less than 3 years. ET is getting back to its roots and could become a distribution growth machine. I think between the new acquisitions and the potential export expansion, ET has the ability to provide larger increases to the distribution in the future and this is becoming an enticing yield story all over again.I updated all of the numbers for the MLPs I compare ET against, and they still look undervalued. I used the following MLPs in my peer group:ET trades at the lowest Adjusted EBITDA to market cap ratio in its peer group at 3.02x. The peer group average is 5.39, and units of ET still look to be on sale compared to this metric.ET's EV to Adjusted EBITDA is 7.89 compared to a 9.31 peer group average. PAA trades at a similar valuation then the rest of the group trade between 9.36x and 11.79x.When looking at the DCF that these companies generate compared to their market caps, ET trades at 4.66x compared to a 7.02x average.ET has the largest amount of debt, but they also produce the largest amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF. ET has a 3.74x total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which isn't that high even though it's the largest in the peer group.ET is also the largest-yielding MLP in the peer group, with a 9.73% yield compared to the peer group average of 7.98%.I still feel that ET is undervalued, considering you are paying 3.02x its market cap for ET's Adjusted EBITDA and 4.66x for its DCF. Today you would be getting the largest yielder out of the growth with a commitment to 3-5% in annual distribution growth at the lowest valuation. Oil and gas aren't going away, and with the global demand set to increase along with production in the U.S., ET's services will continue to see increased demand. If units continue to retrace in the coming weeks, I think the opportunity will just get stronger. I think ET deserves a stronger valuation, and eventually, the market will come around.

Chinese EVs August: Tesla's Shanghai Challenge," () Shanghai's capacity is 1 million electric vehicles (""EVs"") a year. The auto industry rule of thumb is that anything below 80% utilization is bad, which for Tesla means keeping output about 67,000 units aTesla faces the dilemma all carmakers face sooner or later: it can discount to maintain sales or it can accept lower market share andI stick to the sequence above. First, I look at overall auto sales and at EV sales. Second, I estimate Tesla's exports from Shanghai to Europe. I then summarize the Chinese subsidies Europe will use to support antidumping tariffs, from which Tesla has benefitted alongside the rest of the industry. Third, I look at Tesla's sales in China, and at whether the Model 3 refresh will materially improve their domestic sales. In the conclusion, I return to the issue of capacity utilization, and factors that might offset it.Typically the 4th quarter is the big sales period in China. This year August was up 7% over July; early September sales (Sep 1-17) at +2% (source: ) are flat relative to August. Most sales are in the last week, so that may change. Will 2023 set a record? Maybe, but not by much.Now, there are lots of issues that I address in my quarterly overviews. One is the maturation of the market, as the diffusion of ownership means the market is shifting away from first-time buyers to replacement demand and the corresponding rise of the used car market. There's also the geographic component, the saturation of the richest markets (Shanghai, Shenzhen and the other Tier I cities and wealthier Tier II cities such as Hangzhou and Suzhou). Finally, my focus has been light (passenger) vehicles. The commercial vehicle market is very different, declining by 3.3 million units in 2022 (source: ). The magnitude of that decline should be sobering for those who look for continuing expansion of the light vehicle market.Another issue is whether the market for NEVs (EVs + PHEVs) is expanding. The answer is yes, but slowly. EVs hit 24.8% of the market in August, edging above the previous peak of 24.6% in November 2022; PHEVs ticked down slightly. Both however set monthly sales records at 474K EVs and 181K PHEVs (and another 50K for models where my data don't separate EVs from PHEVs, though  imply almost of those are PHEVs). It's a large market, but the end of rapid growth means that an increase in sales of one NEV model now comes at the expense of a decline at others.Until end-2022 sales were driven by national-level incentives. Those ceased on Jan 1st, 2023, and the rebound from consumers who bought before the end of December led to lower sales and the rise of discounting early this year. (That normalization of the market is one topic of my , along with a focus on #3 player GAC Aion.) Unlike in the U.S., however, there are many affordable NEVs on the market, and 3 million public chargers (and another 3 million private ones). That allows NEV sales to expand, now that the impact of end-2022 purchases to catch incentives before they expired worked through the market.The NEV market will no longer show the double-digit growth rates of the past. That's a barrier for all EV makers, as today's pervasive discounting is the new normal. At present only 4 firms are profitable: Tesla, BYD Company (), Li Auto () and Aion of Guangzhou (). The Geely group may be profitable, but the complex shareholding and cost share among its many brands (Volvo, Polestar, Lynk & Co., Geometry, Zeekr) makes their analysis difficult.Excluding cross-border flows inside the EU and USMCA, China is now the world's leading automotive exporter, exporting 2.1 mil passenger vehicles Jan-Aug 2023, and an additional 800K commercial vehicles. Most of those are ICEs, but in the past year NEV exports rose rapidly, hitting 650,000 units during the first 8 months of 2023 (I just got the CPCA update at pixel...). Overall, exports now account for 14% of total passenger vehicle sales, and 13% of NEV sales.So what is the impact if Europe carries imposes antidumping surcharges on imports of Chinese vehicles, or more narrowly Chinese EVs? Years ago SAIC bought the rights to the MG brand name, and uses that for most of its exports. (I've visited MG and Changan dealerships in the Philippines, and Geely is well known.) It's the top Chinese name in Europe, selling 133,00 units Jan-Aug 2023, followed by DR Motors (Chery and JAC) with 24,000 cars. Most of those are ICEs. But while BYD exported 25,000 vehicles just in August 2023, in Europe it only sold 7,000 units Jan-Aug. However, the Atto 3 went from 600 units in July to 2,500 in August; its inroads are widely reported in Europe.The European auto industry is portraying ""cheap"" Chinese exports as an existential threat to a large industry, where mass market producers are already struggling to turn a profit. The coverage of the initial EU press conference named only Chinese-owned NEV producers that have announced strategies to expand in Europe. (A  uses the phrase 东邪与西毒, Eastern Evil, Western Poison.) In my view, based on decades of watching trade policy, the real target is Tesla. They are the sales heavyweight, and the export champion. Exports also potentially come at the expense of production at Tesla Berlin, another factor.()All of the Model 3 in Europe come from Shanghai; some portion of Model Ys are also imported from China. Let's look at the available data. (I welcome anyone who follows Tesla in Europe to provide details on the Model Y there.)Now, this is hard to interpret, given Tesla's history of exports aiming to support end-of-quarter sales pushes in Europe and domestic end-of-quarter pushes in China. Quarterly data is more helpful; I append Jul-Aug 2023 data.It's obvious that exports are an important part of Tesla Shanghai's sales. Let's drill down into the Model 3, comparing European sales and Shanghai exports. Monthly data are noisy, so I did two things. First, it takes time to convert an export from Shanghai into a completed sale on the ground in Europe, so I calculated Model 3 exports in month X less European sales in month x + 1. I then smoothed the data by calculating a 12-month rolling of exports to Europe and (the residual) to everywhere else. The bottom line: Tesla Shanghai depends on exports to Europe for 12,000 wholesale units a month, or just under 100,000 units a year, . ()Since I don't have data on the split between made-in-Berlin and made-in-Shanghai sales in Europe of the Model Y, I can't do a similar calculation. (Automotive News Europe, my source for recent data, does not break down domestic versus import sales.) It's likely though that most Model Y exports end up in Europe. So far this year Model Y exports averaged 18,400 units (and 37% of Shanghai Model Y output). To be conservative, let us assume more of those are exported to Australia and other non-European markets than the Model 3, say an average of 8,400 a month. In that case, .Net: Tesla Shanghai depends on Europe for 22,000 units a month, or 260,000 units a year. In other words, 26% of Tesla Shanghai's capacity is devoted to production for the European market. .Tesla has benefited from Chinese EV incentives as much as other firms, as subsidies targeted domestic producers irregardless of ownership. Automotive News ("","" Sept 21) notes several major issues.Now Tesla benefited in other ways.If the EU crunches numbers, they will conclude that Tesla has been heavily subsidized. (Note I consulted on two U.S. antidumping cases. These are administrative procedures with rules written to facilitate finding dumping and issuing a guilty verdict. EU procedures are to my knowledge similar to those in the U.S.)Tesla will be found guilty, and it matters. By design, a finding of dumping will generate prohibitive tariffs, and while on paper these are temporary, sunset reviews seldom result in reversal. Indeed, in 1964 the U.S. imposed a 25% tax on imported trucks as part of a set of retaliatory tariffs in the ""Chicken War"" with Europe. At the time only one vehicle was affected, the VW van, but under the law they were multilateral in nature, and are still in effect 60 years later. Once in place, they will in reality be permanent, and will effectively end EV exports to Europe. While aimed at China, they will likely be multilateral in nature, and so Volvo exports from South Carolina (and potential future Tesla exports from Mexico) will be hit, too. But that depends on the details of EU law, and I may be wrong.Once an antidumping investigation is launched, it becomes an administrative procedure that politicians can't then stop. None of the reports indicate that we are yet at that point, but I would be surprised if the matter is dropped. The only mitigating factor is that there first has to be fact-finding followed by an administrative hearing. So my expectation is that tariffs won't be imposed until June 2024.In other words, before the end of 2024 Tesla will no longer be able to export vehicles from Shanghai to Europe.Tesla has been very slow to renew its product line, relying on running changes that may reduce costs but do not lead consumers to view it as a new vehicle. This is Tesla's first new vehicle in China since the launch of the Model Y in China in February 2021, but it is only a refresh. (See  on Tesla's slow pace of new models.) In China and other markets, that often provides some PR value and boosts sales, but it is a holding measure. Unfortunately, the initial reviews in China are not favorable, and it is not generating top-of-the fold stories on automotive websites.I searched an array of Chinese automotive websites for articles on the refreshed Model 3. There were stories on turning out the 5 millionth vehicle, on mega-castings, on Tesla's planned Mexican factory, and on Elon Musk's antics. What was conspicuous in its absence were ones on the Model 3.Here's what I found. I left out the ""https://www."" to keep Seeking Alpha from converting into site names.Nothing:Minimal content:Actual content:So, to date the Model 3 hasn't made a splash. That may change, but there's nothing to indicate that the refresh will have a major impact, much less lead to a long-term sales splurge that might offset the potential loss of exports to Europe.Now a Model Y refresh is also in the works. There's mention of it, but no details are public and so it is not yet receiving media attention.This, of course, matters because despite discounting, Model 3 sales peaked in 2020, when the EV market was much smaller. It's the poor cousin to the Model Y, which has outstripped it in sales from 2021Q3, that is for the last 2 years.The Model 3 refresh is a holding action. But holding for what? The CyberTruck is not yet on the market, but that is a vehicle targeted at U.S. suburbanites. The pickup truck market in China is small and rural, and Tesla has announced no plans to produce it in Shanghai. It won't help capacity utilization.The Model Y is a much stronger product, and the refresh may actually help hold up sales. That will not eliminate the challenge of maintaining capacity utilization at Tesla Shanghai.I don't see any mitigating factors. Instead I painted an optimistic case, based on the current negative news on the Chinese economy not affecting car sales.To date the real estate sales decline is greatest in Tier III cities, and not in the wealthier Tier I cities that are the major market for Tesla and the other more expensive NEV models from firms such as NIO () and XPeng (). The financial institutions that have stopped allowing households to redeem their deposits are ones more focused on selling their high-yielding savings products in lower-tier cities. The falloff in construction has led to lots of job losses, but in China such workers are not purchasers of new vehicles. Similarly high unemployment among new graduates does not directly affect the demographics who buy new vehicles. Many prefectures and lower-tier cities are in fiscal stress, but that has not yet led to job cuts. In other words, the upper middle class hasn't yet felt the economic downturn. And if Xi has his way, that will continue to be the case.Nevertheless, the coming year will remain challenging for China's auto industry. Many of the new entrants (such as Li and the Geely group) will have new plants coming into production. Most of the new entrants have sales far below capacity, so face immense pressure to discount. As I've detailed elsewhere, over a dozen NEV entrants have already closed their door. (See ).Discounting will not go away. The over 50% drop in lithium prices in China this year lessen the pain, but since it lowers the cost for everyone in the market it doesn't change the competitive dynamic. Tesla will not be immune to the pressure to continue discounts as it struggles to maintain current capacity utilization.That is not good news for current investors, as shares are priced for growth with high profits. Instead, at least in China, Tesla will not be growing until it can launch totally new product appropriate to the market, even as it loses the European export market that accounts for much of its capacity in Shanghai.============Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Petrobras: A Return To Bearish Ground As History Comes Full Circle,"Over the past few months, I have been one of the few Seeking Alpha analysts who have  a bearish outlook on Petrobras () () due to various sources of political risks. However, this pessimism hasMy initial pessimistic stance was primarily rooted in concerns about shareholder control and the potential impact of government decisions on Petrobras, especially given the company's historical context. Legislative changes, such as the injunction that reduced government control over state-owned companies, could have substantial implications. It's worth noting that Petrobras' current CEO is a former politician from the same party as Brazil's current president, Lula.One of the fundamental questions for theIn light of these factors, my outlook remains cautiously pessimistic. It's crucial to closely monitor future developments and their potential impacts on Petrobras and the broader oil industry. Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of this scenario, and observing how the situation unfolds in the coming years will be intriguing. Brazil's history with past left-wing governments, especially during Dilma Rousseff's administration, has led to long-term value erosion for Petrobras.While it's still too early to make definitive predictions, I believe it's highly improbable that the company will thrive under a management that repeats the same mistakes as those made in the past, which clearly had a detrimental impact on its value.The significance of oil to the Brazilian economy is a topic that deserves careful consideration, in my opinion. The true nature of this resource is often misconstrued. Oil has served as the primary energy source throughout the past century and continues to hold that position. Despite the growing shift towards renewable energy sources, oil remains indispensable and is unlikely to become obsolete shortly.However, owing to Petrobras being a state-owned company, there exists a misconception that the oil it extracts exclusively belongs to ""the state."" This misconception stems from a historical slogan in Brazil. Such beliefs lead people to expect low gasoline prices, complicating Petrobras' management and government decision-making. Society must grasp that while oil is indeed a valuable resource, it is not the sole property of Brazil, and international factors influence its price.Oil and natural gas constitute the primary sources of revenue for the National Treasury, and this trend is expected to continue for many years. Oil plays an integral role in Brazil's trade balance, and its production is rising. In 2022, $42.6 billion of crude oil was shipped,  13% of total Brazilian exports, a share only one percentage point behind soybeans. Exploring new areas like the Equatorial Basin is imperative to maintain high production levels. Oil is critical in the economies of various nations globally, including Russia, where it remains vital even during conflict.The Brazilian government often fails to comprehend the economic significance of oil and tends to focus primarily on fuel price-related issues. People need to recognize that oil is both lucrative and pivotal to the economy, and they must understand its relevance in the context of the global economy.Petrobras has delivered positive results thanks to effective management in recent years, particularly during the presidencies of Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro. This has proven advantageous not only for Petrobras' shareholders but also for the Brazilian economy.The current government, led by President Lula, experienced some luck concerning the price of the oil barrel. From January until July, the price fell to approximately $70 to $73 per barrel, enabling Petrobras to lower gasoline and diesel prices. However, starting in July, prices increased again, surpassing $90.Fortunately, once again, the exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar declined, offsetting one factor against the other. Petrobras still operates with some delays in price adjustments, but these favorable factors have contributed to its stock performance.Now, shifting to the diesel issue, the Russian war has significantly impacted the diesel market due to sanctions imposed on Russia. These sanctions have led Russia to sell diesel at a much lower price than domestic diesel. Approximately 80% of Brazil's diesel imports come from Russia, which has been beneficial. However, I have concerns about Petrobras' future.There was a period when Petrobras encountered significant difficulties, particularly during the transition of government leadership from President Dilma's departure to President Temer's assumption of office in 2016. The company faced a challenging situation, even holding the world's highest debtor title. Additionally, Petrobras faced at the time complications due to an unfavorable exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar, which stood at R$4.Petrobras' recovery from 2016 has relied on implementing a development plan, cost reduction, and capital management. However, these measures appear to have been neglected recently, which raises concerns for me. I am concerned about the possibility of Petrobras  in unprofitable refineries or oil fields. Additionally, there are questions surrounding Petrobras' pricing policy. The company discontinued its Import Parity Prices policy (IPP) in May and introduced a new pricing policy that is not entirely clear.As Brent crude oil prices have been climbing since July, Petrobras reached a nearly 30%  on fuels under the new pricing policy, which recently compelled the company to raise fuel prices in the country. However, the discount persists, with Brent crude oil continuing its upward trend.By the end of September, the  set at Petrobras refineries currently show a 13.6% discount on diesel and a 2.3% premium on gasoline compared to the international market price parity. This marks a change from the previous week when diesel and petrol had discounts of 13.6% and 5.5%, respectively, compared to international prices.The premium on gasoline is due to Petrobras' price increase, which coincided with decreases in prices at international fuel hubs. This increase was partially offset by strengthening the U.S. dollar during the week, which rose 1.4%. Diesel prices remained relatively stable over the week.Petrobras needs a clear investment plan, but it seems this is currently on hold under the new management.Petrobras has  a possible investment in offshore wind energy. Firstly, Brazil lacks regulations for offshore wind energy investments. This means that the company is subject to congressional approval, which can be uncertain due to the lack of a clear government majority. In addition, over the last 20 years, Petrobras has accumulated a series of destructive projects, such as Pasadena, Abreu e Lima, and others, resulting in significant losses.In my analysis, Petrobras should focus on its core activities, such as deepwater oil production, rather than venturing into new projects. Resources are scarce, and investing in offshore wind energy may not be the smartest choice. Another point to consider is the energy transition. Brazil already has a clean energy matrix, emphasizing hydroelectric power. Investing in offshore wind energy may not be necessary since the country has already made its energy transition.The idea of exporting energy is also questionable, as it would require investments in transmission infrastructure to export energy to Europe and the US, which is not feasible now.  show that offshore energy production is one of the most expensive and least efficient. Therefore, investing in something that spends a lot and produces little doesn't seem wise. Also, many concerns exist, from the lack of regulation to allocating scarce resources.Parallel to this, Petrobras recently reported that its board of directors had approved a new , reducing the free cash flow distributed to shareholders from 60% to 45%.The company's investment cash flow for the upcoming years is still uncertain. Petrobras has not yet released its investment plan, which is expected to be disclosed along with the strategic plan 2024 and beyond in the coming months.Over the last five years, Petrobras achieved an average operating cash generation of approximately R$ 160 billion annually, while the average cash flow from investments was R$ 40 billion. Half this amount was allocated to maintaining operations, while the other half went to growth and new business lines (approximately R$ 20 billion each).I believe it's crucial not to attempt to predict the future with absolute certainty but rather to engage in analysis. We are witnessing higher oil prices in the second half of the year, although they are not as high as they could be, primarily due to factors like China's slower growth. Oil plays a pivotal role in the economy, as energy catalyzes economic growth. Completely forsaking fossil fuels, especially when oil consumption is expected to rise in the coming years, and supply remains limited, is not a viable option.Moreover, there are two major players in oil production, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia. Brazil needs to expedite its oil production to capitalize on the growing demand and avoid overreliance on these major players. However, it's essential to acknowledge the environmental discourse. Countries like the UK are  legislation to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, Brazil should not follow a contradictory path by importing liquefied natural gas from the United States while financing a gas pipeline from Argentina instead of developing its production.Carbon capture technology is advancing and could contribute to mitigating the environmental impact of fossil fuel production. The challenge lies in finding ways to use fossil fuels more cleanly while simultaneously promoting the utilization of renewable energies. Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly accessible and efficient, but it's essential to recognize that oil will remain a significant energy source in the foreseeable future.While OPEC  a strong demand for oil in 2024, traders have  their concerns from under-supply to potential oversupply due to the structure of the global benchmark Brent futures contracts. This shift comes as expectations of weak economic growth outweigh Saudi Arabia's output cuts.As a result, I believe it is unlikely that oil will experience a sharp drop to very low prices, such as $30 or $40, in the coming years. Oil will continue to play a significant role in the global energy landscape.Petrobras continues to trade at exceptionally low valuation multiples compared to other global and domestic private oil companies, with a P/E ratio 4x versus the sector average of 10x. However, it's essential to clarify that this 60% discount is primarily due to the significant political risk associated with the company.Furthermore, when considering the forward EV/EBITDA, Petrobras trades at a premium compared to Norwegian state-owned Equinor ASA (), and political risks influence both companies' valuations.Political risk cannot be quantified as it hinges on government decisions that can swiftly and dramatically impact the company's stock, eroding investor confidence. Petrobras has  its CEO 17 times in the last 30 years, starkly contrasting privately-owned oil companies.At current price levels, Petrobras is trading at 2.8x forward 2024 EV/EBITDA, with a 20% cash flow yield for 2024. These levels may appear attractive but do not account for the risks associated with potentially harmful investments or unwise acquisitions. Additionally, there is pressure on refining margins compared to well-managed private peers with successful track records.Furthermore, recent measures, such as curtailing international parity and reinitiating investments in non-core initiatives, have raised additional concerns. Frequent changes in shareholders and presidents, often driven by political pressure and fuel price concerns, should not affect Petrobras' management.Satisfying Petrobras' shareholders also equates to serving the broader society, as all Brazilians are indirect stakeholders in the company. Petrobras generates dividends, which the government can allocate to investments in critical areas like education, healthcare, or national debt reduction.However, the generous dividends distributed last year are expected to diminish. The forecast for 2024 and beyond is regressive due to the implementation of the new dividend policy and potential challenges stemming from price gaps and investments in non-core businesses.It's crucial to acknowledge that Petrobras is profoundly influenced by the international market, with oil prices playing a pivotal role. If oil prices surge, it will present a substantial challenge for the company. Nevertheless, I believe Petrobras can rebound by taking the appropriate measures. Ideally, the company should acknowledge its past mistakes and rectify them. However, the abandonment of development strategies and an uncertain pricing policy are sources of concern.I do not see the current government making the optimal decisions for Petrobras, and there remain numerous uncertainties about the company's future. The energy transition is also crucial, but oil remains significant in the Brazilian economy.Petrobras' stock seemed to have encountered a resistance of around $15 per share in mid-September, relying on favorable conditions, including lower Brent crude oil prices in the year's first half. Even as oil prices rose since July, the foreign exchange rate variation favored Petrobras, which I view as primarily the outcome of fortunate circumstances rather than reflecting the company's improved fundamentals.Considering that at the beginning of the year, amid political uncertainties becoming more evident in the market, Petrobras was stuck in limbo, struggling to break the $12 support until May. And that's where I predict the stock is heading, especially as more discouraging news continues to emerge, with the company trading at a forward P/B that is 17% above its historical average. Consequently, I maintain a bearish outlook on Petrobras for the long term.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Evolution Petroleum Is Going Conventional," () is a small company that has been very conservatively managed for as long as I can remember. A no debt  has been a priority until a spate of acquisitions disappointed the market. But the company listed weather-related and maintenance-related issues that are part of the business. Nothing listed in the earnings report accounts for the market reactionInstead, the market should have concentrated on the rather generous dividend that is supported by an extremely strong balance sheet. That $.12 per share  provides a yield that most investors report on average for a full year return on investments.Even in a disappointing quarter like the current one, cash flow more than supports the dividend. Note that accounts payable changes soaked up a lot of cash flow. That is a timing issue rather than a permanent cash flow decline. It does not, as a rule, represent a lessening ability to support that dividend.But this little operator has $11 million of cash and basically no long-term debt. Not only does the dividend support the stock price long-term, but the debt free balance sheet gives management considerable flexibility in the future to go after bargains, as it has in the past.The paydown of liabilities used about $7 million of cash flow in the current quarter. That kind of thing will happen with small companies. Even with that event (which is likely a timing issue), the company still reported a decent cash balance.Furthermore, the cash flow reported for the fiscal year was a generous (approximately) $50 million. This shows that the diversification program begun a few years ago is successful in lessening the dependence on the Denbury () joint venture. Investors have to keep in mind that a small company like this will have lumpy cash flow because expenditures can be rather large for the small company. going to be acquired by Exxon Mobil (), the immediate future is filled with far more reliability than the Denbury bankruptcy was. Exxon Mobil is a renowned operator with a far better reputation than Denbury ever had as a small operator (let alone a small one that went bankrupt). As management has noted several times, Denbury was clearly cash constrained. That will not be the case for Exxon Mobil.Probably the main danger of the Exxon Mobil acquisition is that this joint venture is considered a high-cost secondary recovery operation. Exxon Mobil is likely to review it for cost improvements and if none are available, Exxon Mobil management has a long history of selling interests in high-cost operators and reinvesting the cash in low-cost operations. So, this main source of a decent amount of cash flow may be facing a period of uncertainty.Much of the conventional assumption is that Exxon Mobil wants the carbon dioxide business of Denbury. Therefore, that same thought process assumes the secondary recovery business will be sold at some point due to the high costs of the business.Evolution management announced a joint venture with Pedevco. This is a conventional opportunity similar to the business run by Ring Energy (). This will take the Evolution Petroleum management further into more traditional upstream business while continuing to diversify away from higher cost secondary recovery business.Pedevco is a conservatively run company that was hurt badly by the events of fiscal year 2020. The reason was that the company had not finished transitioning to an operating mode from a concept company that was acquiring leases with the idea of developing them. This is similar to the Ring Energy story I have covered many times, except Ring Energy had more production going into fiscal year 2020.That still did not stop fiscal year 2020 from setting a lot of companies back. The market changed overnight from relatively friendly to demanding return of capital, while becoming very hostile to production growth. Since both companies (Pedevco and Evolution) are financially strong, the change in the debt market requirements did not affect either that much.On the other hand, finding capital to funding the growth of Pedevco became a real challenge. Now, this joint venture benefits both companies. Evolution is finally getting large enough to have access to low-cost production and growth it can control. Most of the acquisitions before this made it a partner in a situation with a well-established operator, where the operator controlled the partnership growth.The other advantage of this partnership is that the wells drilled in this conventional opportunity are either very cheap vertical wells or fairly cheap horizontal wells. Because this is a conventional opportunity that uses ""modern completion techniques, the decline rate will be slower than is the case for unconventional. Therefore, the cash needed to maintain established production will likely be lower as well.There has been a lot of talk about how declining natural gas prices have affected the total company results. The Barnett Shale purchase was established production that really has had no recent drilling. Older production is often high-cost production.But this part of the portfolio had an outsized impact on company earnings when natural gas prices soared last year. That opportunity may again arise in fiscal year 2025 when a considerable amount of export ability becomes available. It is very possible that the North American natural gas market will join the far stronger world market as North America heads from oversupplied to a larger natural gas exporter.Evolution Petroleum maintains a very strong balance sheet to offset the high cost of secondary recovery and the passive investment position in the partnerships. A lot of operators essentially control the pace of operations, including proposing capital expenditures and new wells. That has made this company consider a strong balance sheet as mandatory.The debt-free balance sheet considerably lowers the risk of investing in a small company. Likewise, the stock price downturn on the earnings report sharply lowers the risk of long-term investing principal loss. Management has long emphasized cash flow. So, this company tends to generate a lot of cash for its size. This company is a strong buy consideration with experienced management and conservative financial strategies, considerably lowering the risk of an upstream play (particularly a high-cost producer like this one) far below the risk of many larger competitors.Recent acquisitions have diversified the company away from the first and still major partnership with Denbury Resources. That partnership is likely in for a period of uncertainty once Denbury is acquired by Exxon Mobil. But then again, the company has other revenue sources.Management has, in the latest conference call, backed the recent dividend. The debt free balance sheet allows maintenance of that dividend for as long as the company chooses. However, should a deal float by, this upstream company, like many before it, could elect to use that dividend money for further growth and stability in the future.Upstream company distributions are not the same as utility company distributions. Investors need to remember that this company is upstream and highly dependent upon commodity prices when setting a dividend. The balance sheet is always the priority here. A big consideration of the balance sheet is to fund partnership requirements as needed.Still, that dividend has financial backing that is much better than many larger competitors. This little operator is a strong buy consideration on a stock price rout that really went overboard from the start of the announcement.The cash flow even in lean times is generous enough to pay the dividend and fund growth projects because this management prioritized ""lots of cash flow"" far in excess of capital requirements. That is unlikely to change in the future. Investors are generously paid with that dividend while waiting for more deals that will fund further growth. That strong balance sheet and the dividend protect against long-term capital loss. But small company stocks are very volatile, as today showed. Investors that consider this company for investing need to be aware of that.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

ConocoPhillips: OPEC+ Supply Cuts Could Translate To Profit Upside,"ConocoPhillips () is an attractive energy play for investors with an above-average risk-tolerance after OPEC+ countries Saudi Arabia and Russia recently announced major supply cuts. Petroleum prices moved into a new up-leg and shares of ConocoPhillips have revaluation potential. ConocoPhillips also hasEvery time major petroleum-producing country announce that they are going to curtail production in a bid to prop up market prices, companies that sit at the source, like ConocoPhillips, are set for potentially significant earningsPetroleum prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine at the beginning of 2022 and petroleum prices have dropped off considerably, including for ConocoPhillips. However, most recently, OPEC+ country Saudi Arabia announced that it  until the end of the year. Russia followed suit and said that it would cut its crude exports by 300 thousand barrels per day. As a result, petroleum prices moved into a new up-leg and are currently trading at about $90 a barrel.As a production-focused energy company, ConocoPhillips benefited in 2022 from higher petroleum prices and the most recent strengthening in pricing bodes well for average prices for ConocoPhillips’ third-quarter earnings report. ConocoPhillips suffered a decline in average petroleum prices in the first half of 2023 as supply fears eased and anxiety about the war in Ukraine dissipated: the average crude oil price across ConocoPhillips’ operations was $57.63 a barrel in the second-quarter () compared to $88.57 a barrel in the second-quarter in the year-earlier period. This marks a decline of a whopping 35%. With supply fears making a comeback most recently, however, ConocoPhillips is set for an earnings and free cash flow upswing in the third-quarter.ConocoPhillips' profits contracted significantly in the second-quarter, although the company remained highly profitable. ConocoPhillips earned $2.2B in Q2'23 across its operational theaters, showing a decline of 56% year over year.ConocoPhillips is considerably smaller in terms of market value, revenues and free cash flow than Exxon Mobil () or Chevron (). However, ConocoPhillips is focused chiefly on its production business which translates into strong free cash flow upside potential if prices remain high ahead of the winter/heating season. In the second-quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $1.8B in free cash flow and the company returned a total of $2.7B as stock buybacks ($1.3B) and dividends ($1.4B) to shareholders. In the first six months of FY 2023, ConocoPhillips earned $4.8B in free cash flow of which $3.0B were spend on stock buybacks.Recurring stock buybacks could, of course, also provide additional support for ConocoPhillips’ share price. ConocoPhillips almost doubled its stock buyback plan to $45B in the fourth-quarter of FY 2022 and has been a steady buyer of its shares in the stock market in the last three years.ConocoPhillips is expected to generate earnings per share of $9.74 in FY 2024 which calculates to a forward PE ratio of 12.2X. Considering that the energy producer is more reliant on higher petroleum prices than Exxon Mobil or Chevron (due to the fact that ConocoPhillips does not operate a refinery business), I believe ConocoPhillips could do very well during a new up-leg in petroleum markets.In my opinion, ConocoPhillips could trade at 14-15X forward earnings. Applying these two multiplier factors to the consensus EPS estimate for FY 2024 ($9.74) result in a more realistic fair value range of $136-146. Shares are currently trading at $121, so I can see 12-21% upside potential to be realized within the next 12 months. Exxon Mobil and Chevron trade at P/E ratios of 12.4X and 11.7X and they offer investors, in my opinion, less upside since their operating portfolio also includes refinery businesses. Production-only businesses, like the one from ConocoPhillips, have higher upside potential in a higher-price world. I recently  Exxon Mobil from sell to hold due to OPEC+'s supply decisions.ConocoPhillips is a production-focused energy player meaning the company is a more aggressive bet on petroleum prices than Exxon Mobil or Chevron which run more diversified energy operations (including refinery businesses, for example). As a result, ConocoPhillips has also significantly more earnings and free cash flow risk/volatility than its larger rivals in the energy business.ConocoPhillips is a well-run, production-focused energy company with considerable exposure to petroleum prices. The company is focused on petroleum exploration and has considerable earnings and free cash flow upside in the third-quarter, thanks to OPEC+ countries Saudi Arabia and Russia cutting back on supplies. Further supply cuts could have an outsized impact on energy markets and petroleum prices as investors tend to fear supply cuts ahead of the winter/heating season more than at other times during the year. Considering that ConocoPhillips trades at just 12X forward earnings, I believe shares are in a buy-the-drop situation and have an attractive risk profile!

DBE: Energy Investing In A Highly Volatile World,"In March 2022, crude oil prices () rose to a fourteen-year high at over $130 per barrel. After the U.S. released unprecedented barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (""SPR""), prices fell below the $70 level. The U.S. SPR declined over 40% from over 600 million atThe bifurcation of the world's nuclear power began in early 2022 when Russia and China formed a """" alliance. Russia's invasion of Ukraine less than one month after President Xi and Putin shook hands made the world much more dangerous.On October 7, the terrorist attack on Israel ignited a war against Hamas. The potential of a significant escalation involving Iran and its allies and the U.S. and its allies is now a growing threat.Crude oil is theCrude oil prices had risen since early May 2023, when the correction from over $130 per barrel in March 2022 reached a bottom.The November NYMEX crude oil future chart highlights the nearly 50% rally from $63.50 per barrel on May 4 to $95.03 on September 28. Crude oil rallied as OPEC+ cut production, citing Chinese economic weakness.The rally ran out of upside steam at just over $95 per barrel, falling to $81.50 on October 6. The October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel ended the correction, and crude oil was back above the $88 per barrel level on October 19. War in the Middle East caused supply fears for the energy commodity that powers the world.Since 2016, when crude oil prices fell below the $30 per barrel level, Russia has cooperated with the international oil cartel, coordinating production policies and turning OPEC into OPEC+. Over the past seven years, production decisions have resulted from negotiations between Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Moscow. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's policies addressing climate change by supporting alternative and renewable fuels and inhibiting U.S. fossil fuel output and consumption handed pricing power to the cartel. Cool relations between Washington and Saudi Arabia and the incendiary relationship between Washington and Moscow have only increased OPEC+'s desire to keep oil prices high.Saudi Arabia needs an $80 per barrel oil price to balance its domestic budget. Russia depends on oil revenues to fund its ongoing war in Ukraine. Moreover, Russia uses commodity production as an economic weapon against countries supporting Ukraine.The U.S. used its SPR to reduce oil prices after Russia's invasion, pushing prices over $130 per barrel. When prices fell to the administration's $67-$72 target range, the Department of Energy only purchased four million barrels after selling more than a quarter of a billion since early 2022. With oil prices heading higher and the U.S. SPR at 351.3 million barrels, the U.S. has far fewer barrels to address rising oil prices than it did in March 2022.Aside from crude oil and oil products, natural gas prices have recovered from the April 2023 low.The continuous NYMEX natural gas futures contract illustrates the rise from $1.946 in April 2023 to the most recent $3.471 per MMBtu high. At just under the $3 per MMBtu level on October 19, the bullish trend of higher lows and higher highs remains intact as the peak winter demand season is on the horizon. European natural gas prices rose to all-time highs as the continent depends on Russian pipelines, and supply fears gripped the energy commodity in March 2022. European prices dropped after last year's warmer-than-average winter.Last year's warm winter is no guarantee the 2023/2024 winter will be the same. U.S. natural gas now travels by ocean vessels to regions where prices are higher. The rally in European markets caused U.S. natural gas futures to rise to a fourteen-year high at over $10 per MMBtu in August 2022 before correcting. The upcoming peak demand season in the U.S. and Europe could cause natural gas prices to rally, with plenty of upside room from the current levels to the 2022 highs.Markets tend to reach peaks and bottoms at levels that exceed rational, logical, and reasonable fundamental analysis. The odds of an escalating war in the Middle East are now at the highest level in history. Israel, the U.S., and European allies face Hamas supporters in Iran, a country with partners against Israel in other OPEC countries, Russia, North Korea, and perhaps China.War distorts commodity prices as raw materials are global assets. Trade sanctions, rising insurance costs due to logistical risks, embargos, and other war-related factors could cause crude oil prices to soar. With OPEC+ driving oil production policies and pricing, the potential for another spike to over $100 per barrel and even higher is a clear and present danger.The DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Energy Index Excess Return is a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on some of the most liquid energy commodities, including WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, RBOB gasoline, Heating oil, and natural gas.DBIQ is a direct investing tool and barometer of traditional oil and gas market prices.The Invesco DB Energy Fund is the ETF product that moves higher and lower with the DBIQ energy index.DBE has been trading since 2007.

"Forget MPLX, 3 Reasons To Buy Enterprise Products Partners Instead","MPLX () and Enterprise Products Partners () are both investment grade, high yielding midstream businesses that have impressive track records of growing their distributions through good times and bad while also delivering very attractive long-term totalSince MPLX went public, it has delivered total returns that have totally crushed those of the broader midstream sector ():EPD has also significantly outperformed AMLP over the long term:That said, when comparing EPD with MPLX, EPD emerges as the clear winner in terms of which is the better risk-adjusted buy right now. Here are three reasons why:EPD beats MPLX in this category hands down, as evidenced by its sector-leading A- credit rating compared to MPLX's BBB credit rating. EPD's leverage ratio of 3.0x isAdditional metrics that support EPD's edge in this category are its robust $4 billion in liquidity, substantial free cash flow generation net of distributions, weighted average term to maturity on its debt of nearly 20 years, including over half of which is termed out to 30+ years.Meanwhile, while MPLX lacks the impressive debt maturity calendar that EPD has, it is still expected to generate between $1.2-$1.4 billion in free cash flow net of distributions annually through 2027 and sums to only ~$1 billion less than the amount of debt that MPLX has maturing over that period. As a result, it is well positioned to soften the blow to its interest expense that may come from having to refinance debt at higher interest rates.As a result, we can conclude that both businesses have strong balance sheets, but EPD's is still head and shoulders above MPLX's.Both businesses have strong and stable business models overall.MPLX manages midstream energy infrastructure assets across two main segments: (1) Logistics and Storage and (2) Gathering and Processing. Their operations include handling natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, and other hydrocarbons. They also transport products in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast and have terminals for refined petroleum. As a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (), MPLX is uniquely positioned near Marathon refineries, often serving as their exclusive provider. This strategic location poses barriers for competitors. Furthermore, MPLX's long-term contracts with Marathon ensure stable cash flow, making it resilient in the face of broader industry and macroeconomic fluctuations.EPD's top-tier portfolio is diversified by asset, energy type, and geography, with four key business segments: (1) NGLs, (2) Crude Oil, (3) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (4) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Its integrated business model and strategically located assets offer significant competitive advantages, presenting numerous opportunities for high-return investments and synergistic acquisitions.EPD's asset portfolio is overall better than MPLX's in our view as it has connections to every major U.S. shale basin and owns strategically located export facilities out of the Gulf Coast. Moreover, its comprehensive NGL network offers unparalleled access to Mont Belvieu. While MPLX's portfolio is also pretty good - especially its refining and Appalachia-based gathering and processing assets - it still lacks the strategic depth and breadth that EPD has.Moreover, its larger scale and geographic and asset diversity give it access to more high returning, low risk growth investment opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions. EPD's diversified operational footprint spanning natural gas liquids, crude oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals offers a balanced and resilient earnings profile. In contrast, MPLX is more concentrated geographically, has greater tenant concentration risk, and lacks the petrochemical exposure that EPD enjoys. As a result, we see EPD as having a more promising long-term growth profile compared to MPLX.Another big reason to favor EPD over MPLX is that EPD's insiders own a significant ~32% of the company's equity. This substantial stake not only underscores the management's belief in the company's long-term prospects, but also ensures that their interests are aligned with those of the shareholders.Meanwhile, MPLX is largely beholden to MPC, which owns a large percentage of their equity and is also their primary business counterparty. While MPLX benefits from the steady stream of business and operational synergies from its relationship with MPC, it also exposes MPLX to the operational and financial risks associated with MPC. Any adverse event affecting MPC could have an outsized effect on MPLX. In contrast, EPD's diversified client base and operations insulate it from such concentrated risks. Moreover, in the past MPC has sold mediocre assets to MPLX at a price that proved to be a bit rich via the Andeavor Logistics . There is always the chance that MPC could execute a similar transaction in the future, which would likely hurt MPLX unitholder value.A final reason why we like EPD more than MPLX right now is that its valuation looks much more appealing. MPLX currently trades at an EV/EBITDA of 9.35x whereas EPD trades at a nearly identical EV/EBITDA of 9.47x. However, when compared to their 10-year averages, EPD's valuation is at a more significant discount (12.23x 10-year average EV/EBITDA for EPD compared to an 11.64x 10-year average EV/EBITDA for MPLX). Moreover, on a five-year basis, MPLX's EV/EBITDA currently stands at a slight premium (9.25x five-year average EV/EBITDA for MPLX), whereas EPD's stands at a discount (9.91x five-year average EV/EBITDA for EPD).When factoring in EPD's stronger balance sheet, overall superior business model, greater insider alignment and less questionable ownership structure given MPLX's close relationship and dependence on MPC, EPD appears to be a much more compelling risk-adjusted buy right now.MPLX is not a bad investment opportunity either, as its 9.3% next twelve month distribution yield - that is well-covered by distributable cash flow - complements its fairly strong business model and balance sheet to make it an attractive income investment. However, EPD's very low risk balance sheet, strong business model, and even more compelling valuation make it the clear winner in the comparison of these two businesses in our view.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Legendary Investor Says Buy Commodities: Our Top Picks,"Legendary investor Jim Rogers  sounded the alarm bells for investors on the dollar and advocated investing in commodities. In this article, we will explore the key points raised by Jim Rogers, share our own thoughts, and also share a few of ourJim Rogers based part of his bullish outlook on commodities on the dire state of the United States' financial health, stating that the nation has become ""the largest debtor nation in the history of the world."" The alarming level of U.S. debt has raised questions about the nation's economic stability moving forward, and Rogers emphasized that no nation in history has amassed such debt without negative consequences.He pointed to historical cycles, noting that no currency hasStill, with the U.S. government saddled with debt, it is inevitable that eventually the dollar will have to be devalued and ultimately face its demise as the world's reserve currency. This paints a bullish picture for real assets like commodities which tend to hold their value over long periods of time, particularly relative to fiat currencies.In addition to the inevitable demise of the dollar, there are other macroeconomic reasons to be bullish on commodities. For example, Mr. Rogers pointed out that many asset classes globally appear to be overvalued. Stock markets worldwide are hovering near record highs, bond markets are only now just beginning to unwind their massive bubble that formed due to historically low interest rates, and real estate markets in numerous countries are showing signs of being in a bubble phase as well. Amidst this backdrop of inflated assets, commodities - particularly precious metals - stand out as undervalued assets right now. As a result, Rogers stated that commodities are currently the ""cheapest asset class"" he knows, with silver and sugar in particular remaining significantly below their historical peak prices.Another reason to be bullish on commodities, ranging from agricultural products to silver to copper to energy is that the demands for these products is expected to soar in the coming years for a variety of reasons, yet production of these assets has been  in:When combined with the rapid economic development taking place globally with the relentless advance of technology and the overall growth of the global population, the demand for commodities has never been greater even as its production appears to be lagging.Beyond the macroeconomic factors, there are also geopolitical catalysts for commodities. In times of economic turmoil and geopolitical unrest, precious metals like gold and silver tend to outperform traditional stocks. With the possibility rising of a significant global conflict involving the world's largest economies (the United States, China, and Japan as well as possibly other major economies like South Korea, Great Britain, France, and Germany and major commodity suppliers like Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Canada, and/or Australia), the appeal of these safe-haven assets could intensify in the coming years.Such a conflict - especially if it involved the semiconductor production capital of the world (Taiwan) - could have far-reaching economic implications, with estimates suggesting immediate damages of $2.6 trillion and potential global depression. In such a scenario, the confidence in the U.S. dollar might erode, rendering gold and silver even more attractive as safe-haven assets.Additionally, commodity supply chains could be significantly disrupted, causing the prices of commodities like food, energy, and even copper and other industrial metals to soar.With so many potential tailwinds for commodities right now and their valuations in general not appearing to be in any way at bubble levels, the risk-reward profile for the sector is generally quite attractive. With that said, how should investors consider gaining exposure to the sector?One popular approach is through exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Some of the most popular ones include:While there are a plethora of other commodities ETFs, this list should give you a rough idea of what is available for investors who want to take a more passive and/or diversified approach to investing in the sector.While ETFs can be a good approach and we ourselves invest in some ourselves, we prefer investing in individual stocks that pay out attractive dividends whenever possible. For this reason, we have significant exposure to energy through high yield, investment grade midstream infrastructure () stocks like Energy Transfer () and Enterprise Products Partners (), among others.We also have significant exposure to precious metals, copper, and other base metals by investing in a variety of miners () at various times, depending on the current state of markets. Some miners we either hold at present or have held in the past include Rio Tinto (), Southern Copper Corp (), Barrick Gold (), and Newmont Corp ().Finally, a great way to gain access to agricultural commodities is through buying either farmland REITs (, ) or through buying shares of major fertilizer companies such as Nutrien ().By investing in these companies, investors can gain attractive leverage to commodities prices, since these commodities businesses often see their profits rise and fall at multiples of the change in price of their underlying commodities. Moreover, they generate cash flow that they return to shareholders, resulting in the benefits of steady passive income along with potentially outsized long-term returns as commodity prices possibly soar higher in the years to come.

Marathon Petroleum: Investing In The Fossil Fuel 'Supernova',"The US oil and gas sector has faced significant volatility, with little-to-no correlation to the S&P 500 over most of the past three years. The sharp rise in oil and gas prices in 2021, led by production cuts the year prior, caused most inMarathon Petroleum has significantly outperformed the general energy ETF (The crack spread has been abnormally high in recent years for various reasons. It also rose rapidly over recent weeks due to refinery outages and a and diesel stockpiles. Accordingly, those two energy commodities have risen in value compared to crude oil, which has also increased in recent weeks. See below:The gasoline spread has been generally elevated since the initial refinery issues in 2020, but has never returned to its pre-COVID levels due to ongoing refinery capacity shortfalls. The diesel spread was high last year due to the acute shortage of diesel fuel. Although that spread declined considerably after, it has begun to rise again due to signs that the deficit will likely return.In my view, the situation facing refining margins and profits on other downstream energy segments makes companies like Marathon particularly interesting today. MPC is hovering around its peak value but trades at a lower forward ""P/E"" of 6.9X, indicating it could be discounted today. Of course, the downstream sector also faces economic, technological, and regulatory risks, which could offset its significant pricing power and tremendous moat. The company faces numerous complex factors; however, I believe its short-term outlook is solid, with decent potential over the coming years. Of course, the company will likely need to make more significant green energy transition investments in the long run. Still, those may never drive substantial profits for well over a decade. Accordingly, I expect MPC will benefit tremendously from the lack of investment in ""legacy"" oil and gas until then.Marathon's earnings  to lower refining margins that quarter, primarily driven by the low diesel crack spread. In Q3, its earnings outlook is much stronger due to the recent spread improvement, with both showing a strong upward trend. However, one of the company's major refinery plants will be  due to a recent fire, pushing its capacity utilization down to 93% from 100%. Of course, this issue is a double-edged sword because it contributes to the lack of available refining capacity pushing the crack spread higher. Across the industry, refinery capacity utilization is around 93% today (a standard level), but total capacity is still significantly depressed. See below:The decline in total refinery capacity is the primary reason for the increase in refining profits, creating a chronic shortage of refined products due to a lack of production and high demand. This was triggered by a large wave of refinery . Refinery shutdowns or production issues will likely continue to grow as no new refineries have . As the country looks to shift toward electric vehicles,  due to the immense costs, low projected lifespan of refining projects, and increased regulatory burden outlook.One company is looking to build a , which will be completed in 2027; however, it will not add much to total production (129 refineries). I expect that project  (and shortages). The labor and materials shortage is a significant secondary issue limiting capacity expansion and utilization. After that, the sharp increase in interest rates limits these companies' willingness to borrow money to expand and strongly encourages a return of invested capital. This trend is evident in Marathon Petroleum, which has slashed the CapEx budget (despite high profits), and substantially increased its cash-flow returns. See below:""Cash from financing"" are net cash-flows from dividends, stock buybacks, debt repayments (being negative), and stock and debt sales (being positive). When compared to Enterprise Value ($79B for MPC), it gives us a ""true"" dividend yield for the company as a whole (not just its equity). That figure is currently a staggering 19% for MPC, meaning at its current pace, it could buy back all of its debt and equity in about five years. Of course, MPC's ability to return cash highly depends on its refining margins, as that is the most variable part of its . More importantly, the sharp change in Marathon's focus from capital investing to return on capital shows the company is not looking to expand and is instead paying back its investors - a great sign for investors. The same trend is seen across the oil and gas sector, with virtually all larger companies halting most CapEx instead of capital returns, indicating a widespread unwillingness to expand into the (theoretically) limited lifespan environment (given the rise of electric vehicles).If the refinery market continues to see low production levels, which I strongly suspect, then there is a significant probability of a sharper increase in gasoline and diesel prices. One major catalyst is the lower inventories of these commodities and the rising fuel export level. Many other countries face similar issues to the US, mainly Europe, which was previously dependent on Russian fuel. As demand for US exports grows amid depressed refinery production, fuel inventories may fall to critically low levels and cause another significant price spike like that seen in diesel last year. See below:Overall, I believe the current situation points to a potentially large increase in refining profits, led by a sharp rise in diesel and gasoline prices compared to crude oil. Low inventories of those two critical commodities, volatile production after summer, and rising export demand could bring a more considerable shortage than last year's diesel shortage. As hurricane season nears, the potential for a black-swan decline in is very high, possibly creating a larger temporary production decline that pushes the shortage to an extreme.I believe MPC is an excellent way for investors to bet on increased gasoline prices. Indeed, it is also a means to hedge against a rise in fuel costs, a significant ongoing risk for most companies and the economy today. Marathon offers thepotential of a sharp acute rise in refining profits, which I suspect could occur over the coming months. The stock also appears attractive over the 3-7 year horizon, as fuel demand may be substantially higher than supply over that timeframe due to underinvestment across the industry. Eventually, the associated increase in fuel costs should accelerate the transition toward electric vehicles, likely causing MPC to lose. After that, the company can still sell chemical products, around 10-15% of total oil consumption today; however, its total profits should be much lower after the transition.I believe MPC's most significant long-term value opportunity is the possibility that the energy transition will take longer than expected. Marathon, and its major peers, are acting as if it will occur very quickly, rapidly reducing investments and returning capital today. However, should fossil fuel demand , the chronic shortage today could become far more significant. In my view, this situation makes MPC a ""Supernova"" investment, where it could see extremely high cash flows for years before its eventual demise (of its fossil fuel segment, but not its much smaller chemical segment). Given the US power grid must be expanded significantly before a  combined with utility , fossil fuels may dominate for longer than expected, extending the size of this ""supernova.""The difference between Marathon and its peers Valero () and Phillips 66 () is insignificant. MPC's valuation is between the two, with a forward ""EV/EBITDA"" of 4.7X vs. PSX at 5.8X and VLO and 3.9X. However, their three-year out-forward valuations are closer, with three-year forward ""P/E"" of 12.3X compared to MPC at 12X. That indicates Valero's EPS will likely decline faster than MPC and PSX. Marathon is larger and has a higher operating margin of 10.4% compared to both of its peers. Thus, I believe Marathon has the best potential to maintain production over the coming years and reinvest  after the energy transition is complete. As such, MPC is my favorite stock in the group, but I am also bullish on PSX and VLO.The most significant long-term risk for Marathon is a more rapid increase in the utilization of electric vehicles. Currently, the EV market is a bit cold, with sales lower than likely due to economic strains on  workers. For the EV transition to occur more quickly, interest rates on consumer loans would need to be lower, discretionary income higher (or EV prices much lower), and fossil fuel prices would likely need to be higher. All those factors are possible, but today's specific environment does not encourage a rapid EV transition. Indeed, I believe the transition may be slower than most expect.Marathon also faces short-term risks, particularly with the stock reaching a new record peak. While I am moderately bullish on MPC, a short-term pullback may occur simply due to its recent breakout. A sharp economic slowdown could also harm gasoline consumption, pushing crack spreads and refining profits back down. That is a distinct possibility today; however has been highly resilient despite economic and price strains since late 2021, so a recession may not harm gasoline consumption as much as it did in the past. A recession would likely further break refinery capacity, probably increasing the sector's total ""supernova"" potential. While MPC faces distinct short- and long-term risks, it also offers tremendous immediate value and is a strong hedge against today's most considerable inflationary strains.

Petrobras: Why Lula Is Not A Threat,"Going forward, there are reasons to be optimistic about Petrobras’s performance. Back in December, I published an on the company in which I noted that the political fears that were spreading at that time due to the election of Brazilian President Lula were mostly overblown as it was unlikely that the company would be fully nationalized or be forced to cut its dividends entirely. As you'll see shortly, all of those fears haven't materialized and only strengthened my bullish thesis, especially after Petrobras managed to generate revenues along with earnings above the 2021 levels while its stock appreciated by ~40% since the time my latest article was published.At the same time, even though the dividend policy was changed last month, it didn’t really make Petrobras’s stock a less attractive investment. Under the new policy, Petrobras is going to distribute 45% of its FCF as dividends to its shareholders, down from 60% before. This is not that big of a deal when compared to other oil and gas majors from the United States or Europe.On top of that, there’s also a possibility that the oil prices will remain at the current levels as is likely to stick with its policy of cutting oil production so that the oil prices remain relatively high. This would make it possible for Petrobras to continue to generate decent profits and reward its shareholders along the way. Add to all of this the fact that international investors are becoming more about Brazil’s economy and accelerate the amount of foreign direct investments into the country and it becomes obvious that Petrobras has more than enough opportunities to try and exceed expectations in the current environment.Therefore, by at ~4 times its earnings and less than 1 times its sales, Petrobras’s stock remains a solid stock to own, especially when we compare it to its American peers. Let's not forget that  () and  () trade at over 10 times their earnings and the only major reason why Petrobras is not trading at those multiples is the market's fear that political risks could be too high for now. However, as I've explained earlier, so far the Lula administration hasn't posed any threat to the company and is unlikely to disrupt the business's operations anytime soon. That's why as institutional investors become more optimistic about Brazil's future, Petrobras's shares have more room for growth as there are no major reasons to think why the company shouldn't trade at multiples similar to its American peers.On top of all of this, even though the company is unlikely to generate the same returns that it generated in 2022 in the foreseeable future due to the normalization of the oil market and the stabilization of oil prices, there are to believe that revenues and profits will be above the 2021 levels in the following years. Add to all of this the fact that oil prices are likely to slightly rebound in Q3 and Q4, while UBS a 20% dividend yield potential for 2024 and it becomes obvious that Petrobras’s additional 10% upside from the current levels is more than justified.The world is in disarray and it's time to build a portfolio that will weather all the systemic shocks that will come your way.  offers you exactly that!

EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,"ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc. () is a closed-end fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations, master limited partnerships, and other energy infrastructure companies. This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus, we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield. This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most income-focused investors.As regular readers will likely recall, we last discussed this fund in mid-September, although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members. The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17, 2023. That was well before energy prices started to tick up in mid-July, so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests. We can actually see this by looking at the fund's performance, which has been substantially better than the broader S&P 500 Index () since that article was published:The difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the S&P 500 Index, which provides a boost to its overall investment return. When we consider this distribution, investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 12.26% over the past five months, compared to 3.60% for investors in the S&P 500 Index. That is a pretty significant difference in results. Fortunately, there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward, although perhaps not quite that strong.There have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article. Most importantly, the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss. Therefore, let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an income-focused portfolio today.According to the fund's , the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return. This makes sense because this is a common equity fund, which is immediately apparent in the fact that 98.06% of the fund's assets are invested in common equity:As I have pointed out in numerous previous articles, common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle. After all, investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of time.In the case of midstream companies and partnerships, a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends. We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index (), which primarily tracks midstream partnerships. Here are the comparison figures for the past year:As we can see, the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 11.93%, but investors in the fund actually realized a 21.31% gain on their investment. This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments. In many years, the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this. As such, we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciation.As regular readers are no doubt well aware, I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years. These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site. As such, most readers should be familiar with the largest positions in the fund. Here they are:I have discussed all of these companies except for Western Midstream Partners () and Plains GP Holdings () over the years. However, Plains GP Holdings is simply the general partner and manager of Plains All American Pipeline (), which I have discussed quite often. As such, it should be quite familiar to most readers. Indeed, all of these companies should be reasonably familiar. That is nice because I should not have to point out that many of these are among the best companies in the industry.There is almost certainly one major change to this list that has occurred within the past few weeks, however. That is Magellan Midstream Partners, which recently completed a pending merger with ONEOK () and is no longer an independent company. As such, it is quite likely that ONEOK has probably replaced Magellan Midstream Partners since the end of August (the date that the fund last publicly updated its holdings). That is by no means certain, however, and it is possible that the fund sold off the ONEOK shares that it received in the merger in favor of something else. At the moment, we do not know exactly what the tenth company is among the fund's largest positions. This fund has an annual turnover of 60.00%, so it does a fair amount of trading, and it is certainly possible that it sold off the ONEOK shares.In a few recent articles, I have pointed out that there are signs that the American economy may be starting to slow down. For example, we are starting to see consumers beginning to get tired of their post-pandemic spending spree and cutting back. Citibank  that consumer spending on credit cards fell 11% in September, which represents the fifth consecutive monthly drop and the largest so far. When we consider that this period included the ""back to school"" season (typically a fairly large event for retail spending) was weaker than normal this year and prices have certainly not declined, this is a very clear sign that one of the last bastions of economic strength has crumbled. Fortunately, the companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are highly unlikely to be affected by economic weakness. This is due to the business model that these companies employ, which I discussed in a previous article:This business model works so well to protect these companies against economic problems that even the COVID-19 lockdowns in the Spring of 2020 had no impact on most of their cash flows. While we did see several of these companies reduce their distributions in response to that event, that was simply because the capital markets did not want to touch anything related to the oil and gas industry. These companies simply cut their distributions in order to pay off their debt and become self-financing. As I have pointed out in many previous articles though, their cash flow was almost completely unaffected. It seems likely that the same would be the case in another economic downturn, such as what might be coming. As we will see in a moment, energy prices could increase going forward, which would put further pressure on consumers.As we already saw, the cash flows of the midstream companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are not significantly impacted by energy prices. If they were, then these companies would not have handled the COVID-19 lockdowns as well as they did. However, their equity prices do still correlate with oil prices to a certain degree. It is not a perfect correlation, but we can still see one in this chart:This chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against the Alerian MLP Index in orange and the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund in blue over the past twelve months. We can see that crude oil prices are much more volatile, but for the most part increases in crude oil prices caused the price of both the fund and the index to increase and vice versa. Thus, the fundamentals of energy prices are still relevant to our discussion of this fund as an investment.Fortunately, the fundamentals of crude oil right now are very positive primarily because energy companies in aggregate have been underinvesting in productive capacity since 2015. There are several reasons for that, including various parties in the market refusing to provide energy prices, investor aversion towards fossil fuels, government incentives meant to promote renewable energy, and various other things. As a result of this underinvestment, crude oil production is not likely to be as high as it would have been had suitable amounts of capital been invested. This poses a problem because most sources right now expect that crude oil demand will not drop off nearly as rapidly as environmental activists and politicians believe. The truth is that renewable technology is nowhere near where we need it to be in order for it to work as a suitable replacement for hydrocarbons.As a result, the production of crude oil is likely to be lower than demand over the coming years. JPMorgan Chase recently predicted that the global demand for crude oil will be 1.1 million barrels above the production level by 2025 and 7.1 million barrels above the production level by 2030:The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries recently made similar statements. The organization's  stated that the energy industry needs to invest approximately $14 trillion into upstream, midstream, and downstream capacity by 2045 in order to avoid a catastrophic energy shortage. That is, to put it mildly, highly unlikely to happen considering that many politicians and activists are trying to curtail investment into productive capacity.There may be some readers who point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is simply talking up its own book with its statements about a mid-term shortage of oil. That is certainly possible, but private companies such as JPMorgan and Moody's are saying the exact same thing. Thus, it is something that we can probably take seriously.The laws of supply and demand imply that a shortage of crude oil would have the effect of raising crude oil prices. As we have already seen, there appears to be a correlation between the price performance of midstream companies, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund, and crude oil. Thus, there is reason to believe that this situation will have a positive effect on the share price of this fund over the mid-to-long term.As mentioned earlier in this article, the primary objective of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is to provide its investors with a high level of total return. In order to accomplish this, the fund invests primarily in midstream companies and partnerships. These are companies that deliver a significant percentage of their total return in the form of direct payments to the shareholders. As a result, they tend to have high yields. For example, the Alerian MLP Index yields 8.13% at the current price. The ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund collects these distributions and pays them out to its own shareholders along with any capital gains that it manages to realize. As such, we can assume that this fund would have a fairly high distribution yield itself.That is certainly the case as the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund currently pays a quarterly distribution of $0.65 per share ($2.60 per share annually), which gives it an 8.60% yield at the current price. This is a very reasonable yield for a fund like this and it is sufficiently high to appeal to any income-focused investor. Unfortunately, the fund has not been especially consistent with respect to its distribution over the years. As we can see here, it has had to make a few large cuts over its lifetime, although it has generally been boosting its distribution since 2020:The fact that the fund has not obtained a perfect track record with its distribution could be something of a turn-off to investors who are seeking a safe and consistent source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles. However, as I explained earlier in this article, several midstream companies cut their distributions in 2020 despite their cash flow remaining stable. In addition, companies in the industry saw their equity prices collapse. These two factors reduced the amount of money coming into the fund and forced it to take substantial unrealized losses. Thus, it makes sense that the fund had to cut in response to these events. Fortunately, we can see that it has been increasing its distribution now that the sector has largely recovered.Naturally, though, anyone who purchases the fund today will receive the current distribution at the current yield and will not be adversely affected by the distribution cuts that the fund was forced to impose in the past. As such, the biggest concern for investors today is how well the fund can sustain its current distribution. Let us investigate this.Fortunately, we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis. As of the time of writing, the fund's most recent  corresponds to the six-month period that ended on May 31, 2023. This is a newer report than the one that we had the last time that we discussed this fund, which is quite nice to see. After all, during the first half of this year, crude oil prices were generally much lower than they were in either 2022 or recently. This weighed somewhat on midstream stocks and likely made it much more difficult for the fund to earn capital gains than it experienced in 2022. This report will thus show us how the fund performed in such an environment, and seeing how a management team handles a challenging environment is a very important part of determining its overall skill. After all, anybody can make money in a raging bull market.During the six-month period, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund received $23,247,909 in dividends and distributions along with $178,049 from the money market funds storing its cash. The fund reported no interest during the period. One characteristic of midstream partnerships is that their distributions are not considered to be income to the fund, so the fund only had a total investment income of $4,936,584 during the period. This was not enough to cover the fund's expenses, and it ended up reporting a net investment loss of $5,316,691 over the course of six months. Obviously, that was nowhere near enough to pay any distribution, but the fund still handed out $13,682,401 to its shareholders. At first glance, this is almost certainly going to be very concerning.However, the fund does have other methods through which it can obtain the money that it needs to cover the distribution. For example, the fund received $18,787,159 in distributions from master limited partnerships during the period. That money was not considered to be income for tax purposes, but it still represents money coming into the fund. The fund also might have been able to get some capital gains that can be paid out. Unfortunately, it was not successful at this task as it only reported net realized gains of $8,290,562 but this was more than offset by $42,384,338 net unrealized losses. Overall, the fund's assets declined by $56,823,422 after accounting for all inflows and outflows during the period. Thus, it failed to cover its distributions overall, which is worrying. However, the fund's net assets were still up over the trailing eighteen-month period. In short, the fund made enough money over the course of 2022 to cover all of its distributions for that year and make up the difference for the first half of 2023. Thus, the distribution is probably reasonably safe right now, especially considering that the past few months have given it the possibility of having more gains.As of October 6, 2023 (the most recent date for which data is available as of the time of writing), the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has a net asset value of $34.97 per share but the shares only trade for $31.17 each. As such, the fund's shares are currently trading at a 10.87% discount on net asset value. This is a very large discount, although it is nowhere near as attractive as the 12.91% discount that the shares have had on average over the past month. As such, it might be possible to obtain a better price by waiting a bit. However, realistically a double-digit discount is generally a reasonable price to pay for any fund, so the current price is probably acceptable if you want to own some shares.In conclusion, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is a reasonable way to play the midstream exposure without having to worry about the tax problems that can come along with owning master limited partnerships. This fund is structured as a corporation, so it handles all the tax issues on the fund level. The fund has delivered a respectable performance over the past several months, as it has beaten the S&P 500 Index, and it seems likely that it will continue to do so due to the strong mid-term fundamentals for energy. The valuation is also reasonable right now. The biggest problem here is that the fund failed to cover its distribution during the first half of the year, but due to the very strong performance that it delivered in 2022, it is not straining to maintain the distribution. Overall, this fund might be worth considering for a portfolio today.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Valero: Despite Massive Strength, I'm Considering Selling (Rating Downgrade)","It's time to discuss an investment that has been with me since I started my current dividend growth portfolio in 2020. I bought  during the depths of the pandemic whenWhile I was unable to buy it at the bottom (I was down more than 20% at some point), the stock has turned into one of my best investments, returning almost 200%, excluding dividends.I'm bringing this up because the company has gone from an underperformer with many issues and a high risk of dividend cuts to a company that is firing on all cylinders.Not only is it benefiting from ongoing strength in gasoline demand, favorable margins, and past tailwinds that have resulted in a tsunami of cash, but also newThe bull case has gotten so good that I'm considering taking some money off the table - especially in light of potential economic issues down the road.In this article, I will share my thoughts and discuss the company's risk/reward so investors know what's going on in my mind.Let's start with the bigger picture.The chart below shows the relationship between the VLO stock price (% below its all-time high) and the ISM Manufacturing Index, my favorite leading indicator for economic growth.While the correlation is far from perfect, we see that economic downtrends almost always result in steep losses for VLO investors. Almost always.Right now, VLO shares are up 16% year-to-date, less than 4% below their all-time high.Meanwhile, the ISM Index has been below 50 (the neutral line between growth and contraction) for ten consecutive months.Despite economic headwinds, refining companies enjoy strong tailwinds that are mainly supply-related.Earlier this month,  highlighted some of the biggest issues driving favorable refining margins.According to the article, oil executives are seeing a critical issue of inadequate crude-processing capacity due to a lack of investment, coupled with more frequent shutdowns, as refiners prioritize higher margins and defer planned maintenance.This pattern emerged during the APPEC by S&P Global Insights conference held in Singapore. The consequence of this situation is the heightened vulnerability of fuel prices, particularly diesel and gasoline, to abrupt fluctuations whenever unexpected outages occur.For example, unplanned plant shutdowns have been occurring almost weekly in Europe.According to Bloomberg, Frederic Lasserre, global head of research & analysis at Gunvor Group Ltd., makes the case that many refiners have delayed routine maintenance, making them susceptible to unexpected technical glitches resulting in surprise outages.Especially after the pandemic, too much supply was offline, which forced refineries to produce at elevated utilization rates.Not only is this an issue in Europe, but stockpiles are tight in general.In the United States, inventories for finished products are dropping faster than expected.To make things worse, Russia is increasingly using its energy leverage.On September 21,  reported that Russia is temporarily banning exports of diesel in order to support domestic supplies. This hurts Europe and global supply in general. After all, if one region sees a lower supply, it needs to import from other regions.Having said all of this, instead of easing prices due to new post-pandemic supply, the situation remains tight, pressured by outages, persistent demand, and new geopolitical issues.Refinery companies are winning big time.Over the past three years, America's two pure-play refinery stocks, Marathon Petroleum () and Valero Energy, are up 439% and 234%, respectively. I excluded Phillips 66 () due to its massive footprint in chemicals.With this in mind, what do we make of VLO at these prices?In the second quarter, the company massively benefited from the aforementioned tailwinds.Its refineries had a throughput capacity utilization of 94%, capitalizing on tight product supply and strong product demand in the U.S.The company also started its Port Arthur coker, which has the capability of adding up to 100 thousand barrels of crude oil capacity to the company's daily capacity.Valero also expanded its renewable products.Looking forward, Valero anticipates that low global light product inventories and tight supply-and-demand balances will continue to support refining fundamentals.Global demand for transportation fuels has rebounded substantially, with gasoline and diesel demand on par with pre-pandemic levels and steady growth in jet fuel demand.This outlook reinforces the company's dedication to its core strategy of operational excellence, capital discipline, and delivering on its commitment to shareholder returns.When it comes to its commitment to shareholder returns, the company is seeing tailwinds that were unimaginable a few years ago.For example, in 2012, the company spent more than 100% of depreciation and amortization on sustaining capital expenditures. In 2022, that number was 55%, indicating much more efficient operations.Furthermore, the company's total CapEx requirements are below the longer-term average, thanks to lower growth CapEx, as major projects have progressed nicely over the past few years, generating additional earnings.Hence, after spending 2020 and 2021 protecting the , the company is now back on track, repurchasing stock and raising its dividend.Last year alone, the company distributed $6.1 billion to shareholders, which was a blowout record and still less than 50% of its net income.In the second quarter, the company made clear that it has a strategy of balancing dividends with share repurchases to ensure an optimal allocation of capital to provide returns to shareholders.As the overview above shows, Valero's share repurchase program is a fundamental element of its capital allocation strategy.The significant allocation of funds, amounting to $951 million in the second quarter for the repurchase of shares, shows the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and belief in the intrinsic value of its shares (buying back shares when the valuation looks attractive).The repurchase of roughly 8.4 million shares in the quarter alone reflects the proactive steps Valero is taking to manage its outstanding shares and potentially enhance shareholder value.Having said that, the current dividend yield is 2.8%, which is nothing to write home about, at least not in the energy sector, where drillers often pay much higher yields.On January 31, the company hiked by 4.1%, which shows that it is still mainly focused on buybacks instead of hiking its quarterly dividend commitment.Nonetheless, going forward, I expect dividend growth to pick up.The company has a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, which is one of the best numbers in its sector. It is expected to lower net debt to less than $3 billion next year, and free cash flow expectations indicate a >12% free cash flow yield next year.In other words, if the company were to spend every penny of free cash flow on distributions, it could distribute 12.3% of its market cap to shareholders.I'm not saying that will happen, but it shows how much cash this company is generating.Note that free cash flow is expected to fall in the years ahead. This is not an indication that Valero is doing something wrong. It shows that analysts are expecting a normalization in refining margins, as no analyst is willing to incorporate prolonged geopolitical issues and other supply forces in their estimates. I can get behind that.However, it means that any tailwinds could lead to higher expectations for the quarters and years ahead.This part is so tricky. Not only because nobody knows how long refinery margins will remain tight but also because the global economy isn't doing so well right now. We could easily run into a scenario where demand destruction offsets tight supply.Having said that, the company is trading at less than 4x 2023E EBITDA. That number rises to 6.6x 2025E EBITDA due to the aforementioned decline in expected margins.If we apply an 8x multiple, we get a price target of $177. The current consensus price target is $145, a dollar below the current price.My opinion is that the company will generate higher-than-expected earnings (including EBITDA and free cash flow) over the next few years. I do not expect supply to rebound as quickly as expected, and I'm also not a supporter of the thesis that quick EV adoption will significantly hurt demand.If anything, emerging demand in markets like Asia and Africa will likely provide strong export demand growth for decades to come.Having said that, I'm considering selling a bit of VLO.This is not a call to get people to sell VLO. This is just my view on the mid-term risk/reward.I believe that VLO has a very bright future, and if I decide to sell, I will be on the hunt to buy back at lower prices. That could be triggered by a further decline in economic growth, causing potential demand destruction to offset supply tailwinds.Valero Energy has transformed from a struggling investment to a major success.The refining industry, despite economic headwinds, is thriving due to supply-related factors. Recent geopolitical shifts, like Russia's temporary diesel export ban, emphasize this.Valero's strategic growth and financial discipline bode well for investors. The company's prudent capital allocation strategy, boasting a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, signifies a commitment to shareholder returns.Nonetheless, given the current risk/reward and other investment opportunities, I'm considering selling a bit of Valero Energy Corporation to potentially buy it back at lower prices if I get the chance.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Cautiously Bullish Oil,"For the most part, indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish - as they have been for much of this year.On the term structure front, both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures. Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports, reduced production of Saudi heavy/sour crudes (which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline) and a number of other factors, the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardation.Meanwhile, WTI calendar spreads (represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole. The EIA's (historically noisy) estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning, but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen. Regardless, the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at present.We can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above, as well as looking at refined product crack spreads. As we can see below, gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks, while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firm.Clearly, the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated, a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand side.Such dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand, whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages. Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present, having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline, or to reduce runs, thus reducing the amount of crude they consume. This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market. After all, refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oil.Thus, all else equal, unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm, it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the $95-$100 area in the near future, particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lower.Though, as we have seen, outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil. Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic, with the Dubai-Brent spread (a proxy for Asia/China oil demand) continuing to trend lower overall and near parity.While the various Africa-Brent crude oil differentials also remain strong. This is an important relationship to track, as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell off.While the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight, we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September. Indeed, if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages, the picture has now turned unfavourable, as we are seeing far more builds than draws.In terms of commercial inventory levels overall, total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages. Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages, as do diesel stocks. The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present. For me to once again become uber bullish (though I remain cautiously bullish), persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the norm.In terms of the outlook for supply and demand, consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4, though to a lesser extent, prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024. Although such forecasts are full of assumptions and thus fraught with error, it is worth noting what the EIA, IEA, OPEC and others are expecting in terms of production and consumption. For now, consensus is expecting a 0.5-1 mb/d deficit to close out the year, which if true, will show up in persistent inventory drawdowns as well as the key indicators of the physical market, which to me are far more reliable indicators of the outlook for oil. When it comes to positioning, this is unfortunately where things take a bearish turn.All good bull markets in energy are driven by low levels of speculative positioning (i.e. hedge funds and CTAs) who are then forced to cover shorts and drive prices higher on the back of favourable fundamentals. This is exactly what has occurred since speculators were caught heavily underweight crude oil around mid-year, thus providing the fuel for much of the subsequent rally from $70 to $95 crude.Now, despite a significant level of unwinding of speculative longs in RBOB gasoline and ultras low sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures, hedge funds and CTAs remain heavily long WTI futures, a dynamic which will prove a material headwind for oil. This is not to say speculative positioning cannot become even more extended, but the fundamentals need to be significantly bullish for them to do so.From a technical perspective, however, it is difficult to argue that recent price action remains favourable for bulls. We continue to see a trend of higher highs and higher lows, with the $90-$92 level now acting as key resistance. Should we fail once again to break through this level, then I suspect this is the market telling us how high the ceiling is for oil prices for the time being. But, as it stands, price action remains constructive and a break above $92 for WTI should usher in $100 crude in short order.The same can be said of the energy equities, with the XLE ETF () continuing its relative strength and very much looking like it wants to break out above the $93 level which has acted as key resistance for over 12 months now. Again, a decisive break to the upside would be telling in relation to the future movements in the energy space.On the other hand, it is also worth noting we are now entering the worst seasonal period for oil prices in the final few months of the year. The Northern Hemisphere's summer driving season is behind us, although it must be said seasonal swings in demand have had very little impact on price movements this year, as supply shortages have been the primary market driver.

However, the company  Seeking Alpha on Tuesday it does not expect a meaningful impact on its financial results in the near-term from the new curbs., an analyst at TF International Securities, said the new rules were bad for Nvidia () and results should be closely monitored to see if the company can compensate those lost sales.“The new ban undoubtedly negatively impacts Nvidia, given the robust demand for AI chips from Chinese customers (accounting for 15–20% of AI chip (CoWoS) shipments in 2024),” Kuo wrote in a note. The analyst also noted that this makes for a short-term entry opportunity into AMD () if shares fall. Intel () stands to lose out because of the new guidelines, Kuo said.The U.S. unveiled initial restrictions on semiconductors and equipment in October 2022. The new rules require that companies notify the U.S. government before selling certain chips that could be used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing and pose a national security risk, according to a senior administration official.The updated restrictions allow the sale of advanced commercial chips to Chinese companies for use in consumer products such as smartphones, computers and electric vehicles. The U.S. will also require that companies get a license to sell chips to more than 40 countries which Chinese companies could use as intermediaries to get around the controls.",14,2023-10-17T13:12:48.000-04:00
Imperial Petroleum: New All Time Lows Following Surprise Equity Offering - Sell,"  Last week, Imperial Petroleum  sequentially weaker second quarter results as fleet utilization was impactedNevertheless, Imperial Petroleum generated record-high operating cash flow of $32.8 million.However, cash and cash equivalents were down by more than $15 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis as the company utilized approximately $46 million in cash to repay its remaining debt obligations.While management expects Q3 results to be seasonally weaker, Imperial Petroleum should still generate substantial cash flow from operations.During the quarter, the company  the spin-off of the Handymax dry bulk carriers Apparently, things have changed in recent weeks as on July 17, Imperial Petroleum perplexed investors with the  of its sole Aframax tanker  to the alleged dry bulk shipping pure play C3is (emphasis added by author):According to statements made by CEO Harry Vafias on the highly entertaining , the company will recognize an approximately $11 million gain from the sale of the vessel in Q3.Please note that Imperial Petroleum received only 10% of the purchase price at closing with the remainder being due on July 14, 2024, at the latest date.C3is investors should hope that the tanker charter rate environment remains strong over the next twelve months as otherwise the vessel would not generate sufficient cash to pay for the portion of the purchase price not covered by a likely bank financing.

Berkshire Hathaway: Time To Double Down," Alleghany Corporation a year ago.Going forward, several growth catalysts should help Berkshire Hathaway continue to generate solid returns in the insurance business. One of those catalysts is the optimization of hundreds of GEICO’s into a dozen systems to slash costs and improve the efficiency of the business. On top of that, the rising demand for insurance policies will also make it possible for the business to flourish. The latest reports indicate that the and insurance markets are expected to grow at an annual rate of ~9% and 8.5%, respectively, and worth several trillion dollars in the next few years, which provides plenty of growth opportunities for Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance business.As for Berkshire Hathaway’s public holdings, there are reasons to believe that the launch of new products by Apple () could after three-quarters of revenue decline for the company, and lead to an increase of unrealized gains for Buffett’s firm. At the same time, the oil production cuts by OPEC+ members would likely prevent a decline in oil prices, which is a positive development for Chevron () and Occidental Petroleum (), which are the biggest oil stocks in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.What’s more is that Berkshire Hathaway’s macro plays such as the investment in trading houses and the purchase of short-term treasuries also have the potential to generate decent returns in the following quarters. As the Japanese economy at an impressive rate while its inflation remains stable, the country’s trading houses have the opportunity to maximize profits after years of underperformance due to the lasting effects of Japan’s lost decade.

The company has a world-class graphite deposit north of Montreal, Quebec.The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in March of this year. , headquartered in London, is focused on investments along the value chain of electrification in lithium, platinum, nickel, and graphite. So, any automaker striking an agreement with Nouveau Monde for graphite could have close relations with other minerals used in EVs.Eric Desaulniers, CEO of Nouveau Monde, said: ""We have produced about 500 tonnes of product so far that can reach 98% and sometimes 99% purity just after a simple flotation process to qualify our product with customers. The grade of the deposit is 4.5% carbon graphite, similar to what is produced in China, the biggest producer of flake graphite with about 70% of the market.""NMG is expected to produce 100,000 tonnes per year, according to Pallinghurst, with a mining life of 30 years.A  said that the company is working with Caterpillar () to test mining equipment for its fully-electric mine, which will be ""zero exhaust"". NMG is setting its sights on clean mining, which will appeal to customers and local authorities.Statista has forecast a nearly fourfold increase in lithium-ion battery demand by 2023.Their  also shows that China led the graphite mine production globally with 850,000 metric tonnes. African nations Madagascar and Mozambique are second and third respectively with 170,000 and 110,000 respectively, so NMG could be among the top producers when its mine is running to capacity.After Brazil with its 87,000 metric tonnes comes Russia and Canada with 15,000 each, so this is a market heavily dominated by China. According to the supply chain group, Alliance for Automotive Innovation, almost one-third of the graphite currently consumed in the United States comes from China. The new curbs will come into effect by December 1, so it would not be a surprise to hear of a strategic agreement with NMG for its future production. The price of graphite could also rise ahead of that date as battery producers seek to build their inventories.At the current market price, Nouveau Monde has a market capitalization of $167M.The China news comes after the company made a small profit in the latest  to the end of June 2023. A C$1.3 million net income was higher than the C$14 million loss for the same period a year earlier. However, the collective loss for the six months to the end of June was around C$20 million, but C$6 million of that was from a change in the value of derivatives. The company also invested C$10 million in property, plant and equipment. The China news will likely spur NMG to move as quickly as possible to get production ramping up and that could see new investment, alongside the potential for strategic deals with EV customers.Graphite is a dominant mineral in the manufacture of batteries and with the whole world moving to electric vehicles, one can only assume that the mineral will become more scarce and expensive.There are other technologies that could take over from graphite and that would hurt the outlook for NMG. However, silicon is the current challenger and Graphex CEO John DeMaio spoke to  of its limitations.""Silicon has some very desirable properties-it stores significant amounts of energy, it's very conductive, it's lighter-but there are some challenges with it. So all the workable batteries that are out there now use graphite on the anode side, and they will for-as we see it-the foreseeable future.""He added that silicon expands during charging and said:""Silicon can grow up to 400% of its original size, and that expansion creates a challenge for the physical properties of battery technology. If you have 800 to 1,800 individual cells that make up an EV battery, if each one expands, obviously you're going to have a real problem with constraining that.""So, the near-term demand for graphite does not look to be a problem for Nouveau Monde.China's announcement that it will curb graphite exports is a big hit to the EV sector at a time when price wars dominate the sector. With a huge dominance in graphite production, China has a grip over the future of EV manufacturing but Western countries are fully committed to electrification and will have to find friendly suppliers. The next two producers with some dominance are African countries and that adds logistical concerns. As Nouveau Monde mining starts production, the company is well placed to benefit and could see new investment support or strategic deals with EV producers to bring its deposit to the market faster. The market dynamics look favorable for NMG at a low market cap and investors should definitely consider the company as it could become instrumental to the pace of EV manufacturing in the U.S.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Is Albemarle Stock A Buy Amid Electric Car Market Expansion,"Albemarle Corporation () is one of the leading companies in the global specialty chemicals market. The company is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.The company operates through three business segments, EnergyStorage, Specialties, and Ketjen, whose products and servicesAt the same time, the Energy Storage segment is a crucial segment of the company, contributing approximately 74.4% of its total revenue for the second quarter of 2023, focused on producing, developing, and commercializing lithium-based products.Lithium, an alkali metal, has many unique chemical properties that make it in demand in the production of medicines for the treatment of mental illness, glass, plastic products, and lithium-ion batteries, widely used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles.WeBased on 2022 results, electric vehicle sales reached a new record of 10.2 million units, up 56.9% year-on-year. Since 2012, when only 118 thousand electric vehicles were sold worldwide, there has been a noticeable trend of exponential growth in their sales. Simultaneously, China is a country that plays a key role in the development of the electric vehicle industry, thanks in part to the rapid deployment of charging infrastructure and the Communist Party's supportive industrial policy.According to the Before delving into Albemarle's Q2 2023 financial results and our expectations for the second half of 2023, we'd like to bring your attention to its institutional investors.Despite the continued decline in lithium carbonate prices in recent months, Albemarle's , including financial organizations Vanguard Group, State Street, Bank of America, Capital Research Global Investors, and Blackrock, maintain a collective stake of 32.33% of the company's shares.These Wall Street giants continue to believe in the company's bright future, and, more importantly, the total proportion of  holding Albemarle shares has remained stable in recent quarters.The  showed mixed results, as Albemarle's revenue declined from the previous quarter due to lower prices for its lithium-based products, but it continued to beat analysts' consensus EPS estimates in recent years. As a result, this is one of the factors confirming the continued effectiveness of Albemarle's business strategies despite the growth of geopolitical tensions and the deteriorating global macroeconomic environment., Albemarle will publish its financial report for the third quarter of 2023. , Albemarle's revenue is expected to be $2.09-$2.95 billion, up 15.8% year-over-year and 7.1% higher than analysts' expectations for the prior quarter. On the other hand, according to our model, the company's total revenue will be above the median of this range and reach $2.62 billion.Albemarle's quarterly and year-over-year revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased sales volume in the Energy Storage and Ketjen segments and higher prices for performance catalyst solutions (PCS). These two factors partially minimize the damage from strengthening the US dollar against major foreign currencies and lowering lithium carbonate prices.Additionally, we forecast that Albemarle's operating income margin will reach 30.4% by 2023. Moreover, in 2024, this financial metric will rise to 34.1%, mainly due to an increase in lithium prices and sales volume as a result of an increase in the production of electric vehicles, optimization of labor costs, improved mining efficiency, and a weakening US dollar relative to other foreign currencies., Albemarle's Q3 EPS is expected to be $2.17-$5.29, down 10% from the consensus estimate for the second quarter of 2023. At the same time, according to our model, Albemarle's EPS will be $4.58, a decrease of 38.9% compared to the previous year.Furthermore, the company's Non-GAAP P/E [TTM] is 4x, which is 67.97% lower than the sector average and 84.14% lower than the average over the past five years. Meanwhile, Albemarle's Non-GAAP P/E [FWD] is 5.19x, which is one of the factors indicating its conservative assessment by financial market participants during the period of continued growing demand for electric cars in the world.Unlike many companies in the materials sector, Albemarle's debt remains relatively low, allowing it to attract significant interest from institutional and retail investors as the world transitions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric cars.At the end of the second quarter of 2023, Albemarle's total debt was about $3.66 billion, an increase of $1.11 billion over 2021. Thanks to the significant increase in EBITDA over the past two years, the company's total debt/EBITDA ratio decreased from 2.95x to 1.01x.Albemarle Corporation is one of the leading companies in the global specialty chemicals market.Due to a sharp decline in the company's margins in the second quarter of 2023 and concerns among financial market participants about the higher growth rate of lithium supply in recent weeks, Albemarle's share price has declined by more than 25% over the past six months.We believe that some of the main risks to the company's financial position are the continued downward pressure on lithium prices caused by the sluggish Chinese economic recovery and the sharp increase in US household debt, which could ultimately lead to lower demand for new electric vehicles in the short term.However, while Mr. Market is extremely pessimistic about Albemarle at the moment, we believe that the company will play a crucial role in the development of the fast-growing battery market for electric vehicles. In addition, its management has continued to increase its dividend payments year after year for 29 years, providing another investment thesis that makes Albemarle an attractive asset over the long term.We initiate our coverage of Albemarle with an ""outperform"" rating for the next 12 months.

Imperial Petroleum Inc. (IMPP) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Imperial Petroleum Inc. () Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2023 11:00 AM ETHarry Vafias - CEOIfigeneia Sakellari - Interim CFOGood morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for our Third Quarter and Nine Months 2023 Call of Imperial Petroleum. I'm Harry Vafias, the CEO of the company and with me today is Ms. Ifigeneia Sakellari, who will be discussing our financial performance.Before we commence our discussion, please look at Slide number 2. In essence, it's made clear that this presentation may contain some forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.We raise the attention of our investors to the fact that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may potentially affect our company's performance in the future. In addition, we'd like to state that during this call, we will quote monetary amounts unless explicitly stated otherwise are all denominated in US dollars.Starting on Slide 3, it’s a summary of our company's performance highlights. Since Q1 2022, we have had profitable quarters repeatedly. This is the seventh quarter we managed to maintain our profitability and we strive to continue to do so.The third quarter of 2023 added to our established strong results as in the nine months of 2023 period, our total net income came in at circa $64 million corresponding to an EPS of $3.59, which is far higher than our current share price levels. Although profitable, our Q3 results did not reflect the strong momentum of the past couple of quarters.Seasonal factors in conjunction with three scheduled drydockings that took place in this quarter hindered our revenue generation, which amounted to $29.4 million, an amount lower than expected.Idle time faced both due to technical andApart from lower revenue generation, we did incur $3 million of drydocking costs and almostOn the other hand, our results this quarter were enhanced by our hefty gain from the sale of our Aframax tanker, the Afrapearl II. This amounted to $8.2 million, along with $600,000 of related interest income accrued to-date. Imperial Petroleum continues to enjoy an admirable free cash base of $126 million, which is approximately three times higher than our market cap.In addition, as a means to give value back to our shareholders and indirectly contain dilution, we commenced a share buyback scheme under which we have bought to-date about 1.1 million shares and proceeded as well with the repurchase of 2.6 million of outstanding warrants.On Slide 4, we provide the summary of our current fleet employment. Both of our handysize bulk carriers are on a short time charters, expiring in November 2023 and January 2024, respectively. While all of our tankers are operating in the spot market, the spot market remains favorable and hence as a general trend owners prefer spot activity than committing vessels to time charters.In Q3, tanker rates were affected by seasonal factors. However, the recent crisis in the Middle East has caused the rise in day rates, particularly for the Suezmax and Aframax tankers. Looking at our dry vessels, we do witnessed a slight improvement in rates, but the market is still well below the 2022 levels.On Slide 5, we're reviewing the tanker market. The global economic activity has been affected. Russia's invasion in Ukraine, the past COVID-19 pandemic, and most recently, the crisis in the Middle East. In this environment, the IMF expects global GDP growth to fall from 3.5% in 2022 to about 3% in both 2023 and 2024.In spite of the expected economic slowdown and concerns about the deceleration of China's economy, energy demand outlook remains positive. Global oil demand surged in June 2023 and is forecasted to increase by 2.4 million barrels in 2023, followed by another 2.2 million barrels per day in 2024.In terms of oil supply, its anticipated that low inventories will exert upward pressure on oil prices. Market will be governed by a supply shortfall, the extent of which will mostly depend on non-OPEC production levels.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has had a long lasting effect on the tanker market. Tanker ton-miles have grown by 3.8% in 2023 and this growth has been supported by the sanctions imposed on Russian oil trades.In Q3 2023, we saw a softer tanker market in general than what we saw in the first two quarters of this year, both on the dirty and on the clean side. This is in line with normal seasonal trends. However, on the dirty side, we also saw voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia, combined with Russia, finally leaving up to the announced oil supplier reductions, factors have led to a further decrease of export volumes and consequently, to a downward pressure on day rates.On the clean side, the market experienced significant volume reductions, resulting from the refinery maintenance season and this combined with lower than expected restocking of storage in Europe meant lower earnings for owners compared to the average earnings during the first half of this year.The expectation going forward is a rebound of both dirty and clean market in Q4. The major shifts include product trade flows resulting from the sanctions getting the Russian petroleum exports remain in place and this is expected to support the tanker market at least in the short to medium term.The current crisis in the Middle East is adding further uncertainty to the oil market, resulting in more oil price volatility. With the conflict as it stands, we don't expect to have a major impact on tanker markets. However, should the conflict escalate further then the risk of major impact on the tanker market will multiply.The state of [Indiscernible], probably the more strategic narrow passage for oil and oil products in the world could then be at risk of a military conflict. This, again, could give a major boost to tanker day rates.On Slide 6, focusing on the product tanker market, the global product tanker order book stands at 167 vessels, 6% of the total fleet. A total of 17 vessels are scheduled for delivery within the remainder of this year. Going forward, we do anticipate a shortage of vessels as the ratio of order book to vessels over 20 years of age is 44%.Berth capacity is limited up until 2027 due to non-existent yard space and owners need to consider environmental regulations, which are due to come in force over the coming years before committing to the purchase of any new ship.I will pass now the floor to Ms. Sakellari, who will provide a summary of our financial performance.Thank you, Harry, and good morning to everyone. When looking at the nine months for 2023 period of this year, our total profit generation is impressed. In the nine months of 2023, we have generated a net income close to $63 million, an outstanding performance given that we operate a small fleet of 10 vessels.Focusing solely on the third quarter of 2023, this indeed was a softer quarter than prior periods, mostly due to seasonal factors. Our fleet operational utilization for the third quarter of the year came in at about 71% as we had about a 100 days of technical off hire due to the scheduled drydocking of three of our product tankers and commercial ideal days stemming mostly from our Suezmax tankers, the Suez Protopia. About 67% of our fleet calendar days equivalent to 565 days were dedicated to spot activity.Looking at our income statement for Q3 2023 on Slide 7 compared to Q3 2022, revenues came in at $29.4 million compared to $42.6 million due to decline in revenues resulting from the sale of Afrapearl II, increased idle time due to three scheduled drydockings, and one of our Suezmax tanker being commercially idle for one-third of the quarter.Voyage cost decreased by $5.8 million due to the decrease of our daily banker costs by $13,400 as a result of oil prices in Q3 2023. Our running costs increased by $1.2 million due to the increase in the average number of our vessels. In this quarter, we also incurred a $8.2 million gain on sale related to the sale of our Aframax tanker Afrapearl II to C3is Inc.In relation to the sale, we also incurred $600,000 of interest income accrued in connection with the remaining consideration of $38.7 million, which is receivable by July 2024.In terms of drydocking costs, this amounted to $2.7 million as three of our product tankers underwent drydocking. We have another two drydockings up to the end of 2023, but only one more scheduled drydocking for the period 2024 and 2025. Basis the above, we generated for the quarter an EBITDA of $14 million and a net profit of $12.1 million corresponding to a basic EPS of $0.56.Moving on to Slide 8, let us take a look at our balance sheet for the nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we had the free cash base of about $126 million. Indeed, our operating cash flow for the nine-month period came in at $74 million. Thus, in this brief period, we generated from our fleet operations cash almost 1.5 times on current market capitalization.In Slide 9, we present a financial snapshot placing emphasis on our solid financial position. Our cash balance is quite high in the region of $130 million. We have about $70 million of committed capital expenditure for the acquisition of two tankers with delivery within January 2024.In addition to this, we have a receivable of almost $39 million from C3is Inc., payable by July 2024. Full debt repayment has led to annual cash flow saving principal initiatives of almost $15 million. We enjoy both a healthy liquidity and financial structure.Looking at our profitability in nine months 2023, our daily time charter equivalent per vessel came in the order of $38,500. Our return on equity basis trailing last 12 months is region 27%.One of our obligations in terms of capital expenditure is as mentioned, that we have two scheduled drydockings for Q4 2023. But following this, we only have one more scheduled drydocking for the period 2024-2025. So, our vessel capital commitments will decline drastically.Concluding our presentation with Slide 10, we simply outlined once more the key factors that assist our successful performance. Imperial Petroleum has a proven track record of profit and cash flow generation, sound capital structure management, and fleet expansion, while preserving a strong cash base, which we hope that market condition will allow us to preserve.At this stage, our CEO, Mr. Harry Vafias will summarize our concluding remarks for the period examined.I'm very pleased with our performance during the nine months of this year. In this period, we managed to generate net income of $64.7 million and operating cash flow of $73.7 million, both results being well above our current market cap.I'm also pleased by our Board's strategic decision to commence a share buyback program of $10 million as this is a means to give value back to our shareholders. Under this program, we have purchased to-date about 1.1 million shares and in addition, we have repurchased 2.58 million outstanding warrants. As we aspired that these recent moves together with our strong financial results and healthy balance sheet will soon be reflected in our share price.We would like to thank you all for joining us at our conference call today and for your interest and trust in your company and we look forward to having you with us again for our fourth quarter results. Thank you.",2,2023-10-16T12:11:08.000-04:00
Imperial Petroleum: Weak Quarter But Upgrading On Share Buybacks,"  Last week, Imperial Petroleum  very weak third quarter results as fleet utilization suffered from anIn addition, revenues and cash generation were impacted by the  of the Aframax tanker  (now renamed ) to recent spin-off C3is Inc. or ""C3is"" () in July.Nevertheless, the company still managed to generate almost $10 million in cash flow from operations which in combination with the initial down payment received from C3is for the  and net proceeds from the August equity and warrant  resulted in cash and short-term investments to increase by $27.3 million sequentially to $125.9The company continues to have no debt.However, Imperial Petroleum's cash position is expected to take a $70+ million hit in Q1/2024 with the delivery of two tankers  substantially above market value in the company's worst related-party dealing to date.In recent months, the company and particularly CEO and controlling shareholder Harry Vafias have come under increased  from market participants to abstain from further dilutive offerings.The abysmal performance of Imperial Petroleum's common shares even resulted in an angered investor crashing the former parent StealthGas' () most recent :Apparently, Imperial Petroleum has started to reverse course in recent weeks as the company  a $10 million share repurchase program in early September and subsequently bought back almost 5% of its outstanding shares at an average price of approximately $1.67.In addition, the company has  approximately 2.58 million of out-of-the-money Class C and Class D Warrants for $0.62 million.However, there's still a substantial number of potentially dilutive warrants outstanding:Please note that Mr. Vafias holds 13,875 of the company's  with an aggregate liquidation preference of $13.875 million.With common shares currently trading near the conversion floor price of $1.50 and mounting pressure by market participants, Mr. Vafias might be inclined to convert his preferred stock holdings into an approximately 25% common equity stake.While heavily dilutive, the move would result in Mr. Vafias becoming more aligned with common equity holders thus reducing the probability of further dilutive equity offerings substantially.Valuation-wise, even when assuming the above-discussed Series C Preferred Stock conversion and exercise of all of the company's outstanding Class E Warrants at a price of $2.00 per share, Imperial Petroleum's common shares are still trading at an approximately 83% discount to estimated NAV:Based on my assumption for Imperial Petroleum to continue share buybacks and Mr. Vafias potentially converting his preferred shareholdings, I am upgrading the common shares from """" to """".But given the company's tainted past and poor corporate governance, only the most speculative investors/traders should consider taking a position in Imperial Petroleum.In addition, investors should note the overhang from the Class E Warrants which would come into play should the share price eclipse $2.Similar to peer Performance Shipping (), Imperial Petroleum appears to have reversed course as of late.

Kinder Morgan Looks More Interesting As Consolidation Occurs,"M&A activity is heating up in the energy infrastructure space. ONEOK ()  that it would acquire Magellan Midstream Partners () in a deal valued at $18.8 billion on 5/14/23. On 9/21,  of OKEAfter each new acquisition or merger takes place, KMI looks more interesting to me. KMI has one of the largest footprints in the energy infrastructure space, making them extremely attractive. The moat surrounding the incumbents is wide and deep. Unlike technology or other industries, people don't just decide they want to raise money and build pipelines. Taking a step back, you need to complete a stringent permitting process, conduct environmental studies, purchase land, get regulatory approvals, deal with regulations and ordinances throughout different areas, navigate a changing political and activist environment, and conduct ongoing maintenance to mitigate environmental damage to name a few challenges. There is a reason that in 2020,  () purchased Dominion's natural gas transmission and storage assets for $9.7 billion. It's easier to purchase existing assets than deal with all the red tape of building new infrastructure, and Berkshire already moved 8% of the United States interstate natural gas. If a company such as Berkshire that has the capital and political resources felt it was better to acquire than build, there is a reason why consolidation continues to occur in the space.Traditional Energy has lost its appeal to many because it is highly politicized, but the fact remains that without fossil fuels are a requirement for everyday life in 2023.  is responsible for transporting 40% of the natural gas that gets consumed in the United States through its 70,000 miles and 700 billion cubic feet of storage pertaining to natural gas. KMI also operates 9,500 miles of products pipelines and transports 2.4 million bpd, and 1,500 miles of CO2 pipeline. It would be next to impossible to recreate KMI's infrastructure from scratch due to land requirements alone. Every time a merger or acquisition occurs, I think about adding to my position in KMI because it has a tremendous amount of hard assets that are critical to both the domestic and international economies. Energy infrastructure companies see value in hard assets as they are willing to pay a premium to expand their footprint and benefit from combined synergies. There are many entities that operate in the natural gas space, and KMI has one of the largest pipeline networks in the country. As consolidation continues to occur, there will be fewer options for companies to target, which should increase the premium on pipeline and storage assets.No matter the political narrative, the 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA () indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids, and natural gas will increase through 2050. I am pro-renewables and have several investments in the sector, but the projections coming out of the EIA are that dry natural gas production will continue to increase throughout the United States through 2050 while the United States increases the amount of LNG it exports. The combination of increased production and exporting will have to correlate to more natural gas being transported. Kinder Morgan is a direct beneficiary of this scenario because it already moves 40% of the natural gas produced. If one of the larger companies wants to increase its footprint in the natural gas transportation space, at some point, all roads lead to KMI. Even if KMI doesn't get acquired, it's infrastructure of hard assets that will see higher utilization should see their value increase as they generate larger amounts of revenue and profits in the future.Some didn't believe KMI's management when they came out and delivered their plan for financial discipline. After roughly 8 years, KMI continues to deliver strong results.  finished 2015 with $43.3 billion in total debt and generated $6.91 billion in EBITDA. This placed their total debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 6.27x. I don't use net debt because the cash a company has on the balance sheet may not get allocated toward their debt repayments, so I use total debt. Since amassing a total debt load of $43.3 billion in 2015, KMI has eliminated $11.53 billion in total debt for a reduction of -26.62%. This has ultimately resulted in KMI's total debt-to-EBITDA ratio declining from 6.27x to 4.96x. This is the first time in 8 years that KMI has seen its total debt to EBITDA ratio fall under 5x.While improving its financial situation, KMI has also provided shareholders with 6 dividend increases since 2018. KMI had drastically reduced the quarterly dividend in 2016 from $0.51 to $0.125. The combination of KMI's increasing debt and the blow to the dividend left shareholders questioning leadership. I think investors seem to either forget or dismiss that management and the board of directors own , and their interests are aligned with common shareholders. Every decision that management makes impacts them financially, and while the improvement isn't seen in the share price today, it's hard to argue with what KMI has accomplished. While reducing the debt load by -$11.53 billion, KMI has also increased the quarterly dividend by 126% from $0.125 to $0.2825. The share price may not be as high, and the dividend may not be as large as it once was, but KMI is a stronger company today, and there is significant room for the dividend to continue increasing and for the market to reward KMI's accomplishments.In the last earnings report, KMI disclosed that they see their net income coming in at $2.5 billion, while the annualized dividends paid will represent a 2% YoY increase to $1.13 per share. I am a bit harsher than many energy infrastructure companies as they measure their leverage level by net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, whereas I look at Total Debt to EBITDA. Based on KMI's standard, they are projecting they will finish 2023 generating $7.7 billion in Adjusted EBITDA, placing their net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4x. This is below their 4.5x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA target. KMI is also projecting that it will generate $4.8 billion in distributable cash flow () which works out to $2.13 per share. KMI is paying out 53.05% of its DCF through dividends, which leaves them roughly $2.25 billion in retained DCF for business operations.KMI is in a strong position as they have $3.7 committed to a backlog of projects that will provide a runway for growth. This can all be self-funded through their retained DCF after paying the dividend. There is 37% of the backlog coming online in 2023, with another 32% in 2024. Since KMI is generating over $2 billion in retained DCF they can organically grow their operations without adding debt in a high interest rate environment. This is a combination that can help increase the amount of EBITDA, and DCF KMI generates while allowing them to pay down debt and raise the dividend.I think KMI is in a strong position considering what they have accomplished on their balance sheet and the consolidation taking place around them. KMI continues to deliver on its fiscal responsibility promise as they reduce debt, organically grows through retained DCF, and rebuild the dividend. The market isn't rewarding KMI just yet, but each year that passes puts KMI in a stronger position. I think the market will eventually turn, and we will see shares exceed $20 as the reality of the oil and gas industry continues to set in.  Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor or professional.

Halliburton's Rise: Riding The OPEC Wave,"When I penned  on Halliburton (), the stock was navigating a challenging phase, primarily attributed to declining commodity prices. My core investment premise hinged on the belief that production cuts would carve out a more favorable environmentThe move is largely due to the favorable production cuts by OPEC to support oil prices in the face of a potential fall in consumption due to a global slowdown.The global energy narrative took a compelling twist as Saudi Arabia and Russia confirmed their decision to extend  cuts, removing a consequentialThe cuts saw Brent crude prices surge past the $90-a-barrel threshold-a point unseen since November 2022.There is a strong argument that these factors, along with a possible conflict in the Middle East, will continue to drive prices higher, which will support the multi-year bull thesis I laid out in the last article. Here's what I expect:Along with the supportive macro environment for oil prices, there are other key business drivers:We saw these drivers play out in the last earnings report, demonstrating that the firm has been collecting its fair share of wins.Halliburton's financial snapshot for 2023's second quarter is a testament to their resilience and adeptness.This was a strong report, and one can argue that the stock deserves to be up more despite the strong move due to supply and demand dynamics supporting a favorable outlook.Halliburton will report Q3 earnings on Tuesday, October 24. Investors should look for strong EPS figures (greater than $0.75/Share), but the highlight will be how the changing supply and demand dynamics from OPEC are affecting the business. I would expect a strong year-over-year performance across the board with less sensational improvements quarter over quarter.As you might guess, analysts agree that EPS figures will continue to trend upwards, and Halliburton has managed to beat expectations in each of the past five quarters.It is likely that we will see the expected growth materialize as the major economies are essentially fully opened, and we are unlikely to see any relief from OPEC in the medium turn. There is a risk that if a conflict should deepen between Iran and the US following the horrific attacks in Israel, Iran could aggressively ramp up production as it has in the past to raise funds. This would soften oil prices slightly, but a collapse would be unlikely without support from OPEC. It is likely that Energy will become a hot theme over the coming months due to these tensions, and firms like Halliburton could see some uncharacteristic volatility.Halliburton has undoubtedly proven its mettle amidst fluctuating commodity prices, with the stock showcasing an admirable 45% surge in just a year. This upward trend, fortified by OPEC's strategic production cuts and geopolitical intricacies, hints at the resilience and adaptability of the company. The Q2 earnings report further buttresses Halliburton's prowess in the oilfield landscape. However, investors should stay alert. As global tensions simmer, particularly concerning Iran and the U.S., the energy sector might be in for a rollercoaster ride. While Halliburton seems well-poised to benefit from a surge in oil prices, a recession could dent consumption and introduce headwinds. There is also the tendency of low-cost producers to ramp up production when prices are high. That said, the trade is a lot clearer than it was a year ago, though there is less meat left on the bone. I rate Halliburton as a hold.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

These 15 Stocks Have Exhibited The Highest Correlation With Oil Prices Over The Last Month,"By Andrew ProchnowAs the Russo-Ukrainian war continues to unfold in Eastern Europe, another tragic incident occurred on October 7, when terrorists from the Gaza Strip executed a heinous surprise assault on Israel. While the geopolitical consequences of this event areIsrael and the Gaza Strip are not significant crude oil exporters themselves, but the broader Middle East region plays a pivotal role as a supplier of global energy resources. It's worth noting that estimates indicate the Middle East holds up to 48% of the world's proven crude oil reserves. Consequently, the recent escalation between Israel and Palestine presents a threat to global energy markets, as it has the potential to trigger a chain reaction of violence in other parts of the region.Currently, a major concern is the potential involvement of Iran in the hostilities, which could ensnare other Middle Eastern countries. Many experts have suggested that Iran may have supported the terrorist organization Hamas in planning and preparing for the recent attacks on Israel. Regardless of the veracity of these claims, tensions could rapidly escalate between these historical adversaries.The primary and most pressing concern at the moment is the potential for further loss of life, especially among innocent civilians. Beyond that, there is the risk that Iran may attempt to disrupt the global economy by obstructing traffic in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz. This waterway is critical as it lies at the only passage between the Persian Gulf and the open sea. Estimates indicate that approximately 33% of the world's liquefied natural gas and roughly 25% of the world's total annual oil consumption pass through this crucial waterway.Unfortunately, global energy markets are exceptionally vulnerable at this juncture due to the disruptions stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. This means that any additional supply shocks could introduce significant chaos and undoubtedly inject fresh volatility into the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and other key commodities.The heightened risk of further market disruptions helps to explain the recent 18% jump in the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX) over the last five days and the more than 60% increase over the past month.Crude oil has been one of the most dynamic commodities in the market in 2023, surging from $70 per barrel to $95 per barrel (a 35% increase) between July 1 and September 30. However, oil prices corrected in early October, dropping to as low as $82 per barrel. In the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel, oil prices rebounded above $85 per barrel and are currently trading around $86 per barrel.On Oct. 9, which was the first business day following the unexpected attacks on Israel over the weekend, most of the energy sector showed an upward movement in line with the rising crude oil prices. Many energy stocks closely followed the trend in crude oil.On Monday, oil prices rallied by about 5%. The list below highlights the energy stocks making the biggest moves in the immediate aftermath of the recent Hamas attacks on Israel:Some of the above symbols also appear on the list of stocks exhibiting the highest positive correlation with oil prices over the last 30 days. Listed below are the 15 stocks sharing the highest correlation with  () over the last month, and their associated correlation coefficients.Just as a reminder, when two assets exhibit a positive correlation, meaning they tend to move in the same direction, the correlation value falls within the range of 0 to 1. On the other hand, when two assets are negatively correlated, indicating they move in opposite directions, the correlation falls between -1 and 0.Correlations are typically classified as non-existent, weak, semi-strong, or strong, depending on the extent to which the two assets are linked. For instance, a correlation of 0.15 might be considered a ""weak positive correlation,"" while a correlation of 0.75 could be termed a ""strong positive correlation."" Conversely, a correlation of -0.20 might be categorized as a ""weak negative correlation,"" while a correlation of -0.80 could be described as a ""strong negative correlation.""As a result, the oil stocks mentioned earlier (with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.70) all share a relatively strong correlation with oil prices, or more precisely, with the United States Oil Fund. It's important to note that the oil-focused volatility gauge, the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, is also closely linked to options activity in USO.Beyond trading crude oil based on its price direction, which involves going long or short, investors and traders in the energy sector can also engage in trading crude oil based on its volatility.The CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index monitors volatility in the crude oil market much like the CBOE Volatility Index tracks volatility in the S&P 500 ().The OVX offers a real-time estimate of the expected 30-day volatility in the crude oil market using options associated with the United States Oil Fund. Interpreting the OVX is relatively straightforward because its mechanics closely resemble those of the VIX.For example, if crude oil is trading at $100 per barrel, an OVX reading of 20 would suggest that over the next 12 months, crude oil prices are expected to settle within a range between $80 and $120 (which is 20% of $100, or $20), with a 68% degree of confidence. Additionally, this example would imply that crude oil is expected to trade within a range of $60 to $140 with a 95% degree of confidence or between $40 and $160 with a 99.7% degree of confidence over the next 12 months.Currently, the OVX is trading around 40 and has fluctuated within a range of approximately 23 to 60 over the past 52 weeks. In the last five days, the OVX has surged by about 18%, rising from 33 to nearly 40.During the past 30 days, the OVX has witnessed a remarkable 60% increase due to the sharp correction in oil prices in early October, leading to heightened volatility ahead of the October 8 attacks on Israel.The highest point ever recorded for the OVX occurred in March 2020, when it soared to 190 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as illustrated below.As most market participants are well aware, .In the trading world,  refers to the tendency of financial instruments to move toward their average price over time. Historical data has demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that .Investors and traders frequently engage in buying or selling volatility based on their perception of its relative value. To illustrate, consider a scenario in which the 30-day historical volatility of stock XYZ stands at 20, while the implied volatility (market-based volatility) for options with a one-year duration is priced at 30. In this situation, there exists a theoretical opportunity to sell options in stock XYZ with the expectation that actual volatility will be lower than what the market is pricing.Suppose an investor or trader opts to sell options with a volatility level of 30%, while the underlying stock XYZ historically moves with a volatility of 20%. In such a case, this position theoretically generates a profit.While most investors and traders keep an eye on the VIX to assess potential options and volatility prospects, the OVX proves equally valuable when exploring volatility-focused opportunities within the oil sector.Currently, the OVX is trading below its long-term median, which typically hovers around 68. Nevertheless, considering that the OVX has traded within the range of 24 to 60 over the past 52 weeks, the present reading of 39-40 is reasonably close to the OVX's recent midpoint range.In the future, investors and traders might consider adding the OVX to their watchlists to monitor and capitalize on potential opportunities in the crude oil sector stemming from ongoing developments in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.To pinpoint specific opportunities, market participants can refer to metrics like Implied Volatility Rank (IV Rank), which gauges whether implied volatility is high or low for a specific underlying asset based on a year's worth of implied volatility data. For instance, if a hypothetical stock XYZ witnessed implied volatility fluctuating between 30 and 60 over the past year, and the current implied volatility stands at 45, XYZ would have an IV Rank of 50%. If the implied volatility is presently trading at 60 for XYZ, the IV Rank would reach 100%.Volatility traders often consider selling options or volatility when the IV Rank exceeds 50%, although the specific threshold can vary depending on individual outlook and risk tolerance.Options sales within the realm of the oil sector may become more enticing if the OVX continues to climb, surpassing milestones such as its 52-week high of 60 or even rising beyond its long-term median of 68.Luckbox Magazine.

Tesla's Overpriced Stock Is Susceptible To Growing Competition," () has seen its share price more than double YTD. However, the company has released a quarter-over-quarter decline in electric vehicle (""EV"") production, which, while it had guided to this in the past, indicates a changing growth story. As we'll see throughoutTesla has announced its most recent quarter's production.The company's production was 13.7 thousand Model S/X and 417k Model 3/Y. That represents a ~5% drop in Model 3/Y production and a ~33% drop in Model S/X production. Model S/X production has continued to fall off a cliff, not surprising given that a substantial part of the EV competition has been in the high-end space.The company is maintaining its guidance for 1.8 million vehicles for the year, which isContinuing to lower prices while production is low is a sign of weak demand. Of course, other things could cause this, but our Occam's Razor conclusion is that the company is barely managing to sell the vehicles it produces. The  for a custom vehicle being this month supports this same conclusion of weakness in demand.Unfortunately, because car margins are incredibly dependent on economies of scale, lower production leads to an even faster decline in margins. In the last quarter, the company's margins were down almost 7% QoQ despite an increase in automotive production, due to the impact of lower prices.A major catalyst that can hurt the company in the upcoming months is increased competition from EVs.China EVs have a strong production advantage. In China, EVs average 40% less than in Europe and 50% less than in the U.S. The country's dominance in the battery supply chain gives it a massive advantage. China is 25% of the global vehicle market and 20% of EVs. Production is so high that there are concerns about  impacting other countries, as it outstrips local demand.It's worth noting that Tesla demand is not non-existent. The company is a top-ranking producer in almost every single EV market it operates in. In China, though, BYD Company Limited () has increased vertical integration with its battery production, and the benefit with wages much lower than Tesla which has substantial U.S. wage costs.It's also worth noting that when we talk about Tesla's difficulties, it's in relation to its valuation. The company's market cap is 3x the size of Toyota (), which produces 10% of global vehicles. Even if Tesla becomes tied for the largest vehicle producer in the world, it's still heavily overvalued.Unfortunately, Tesla's market position is much weaker in China, where BYD dominates. BYD is growing faster than Tesla and is a  in China by units produced. That strength is enabling BYD to expand to the local market such as Southeast Asia etc., showing its strength. Brand loyalty is much weaker for EVs.BYD is targeting , showing its growing strength in the export markets, and we expect that strength to continue. The company's exports have gone up 4x YoY. It's worth noting that while we don't expect BYD to necessarily completely wipe out Tesla, in China it does have 4 out of the top 5 slots and a strong manufacturing advantage.The risk here is that while BYD might never compete in the U.S., they will put strong pressure on Tesla to increase its international sales. Given Tesla's immense valuation, it needs strong global growth. For perspective, Tesla is worth ~3x more than Toyota, which sells 10 million vehicles/year. U.S. vehicle sales are ~15 million/year.The growth and increased exports of China EVs present a major short-medium-term risk for Tesla.In general, EV competition is increasing dramatically.Anecdotally, located in California, the author, yours truly, has seen many more Mercedes EVs than expected. The above chart, shows, by global sales, an EV company's market shares. Volkswagen (), General Motors (), Mercedes (), BMW (), and more have quickly become major players in the market and are working to ramp up production.Ford () is expecting 2024 EV . For perspective, that will put it at ~4% in the above. Increased EV production from traditional producers means that, in our view, Tesla has hit its peak market share, and its market share will likely decline from current levels.Tesla's earnings potential is the problem with the company's valuation.The above chart shows Tesla's free cash flow (""FCF"") picture and change. The company's FCF was $1 billion in the most recent quarter, and net income was $2.7 billion. That net income declined from prior quarters. The company's operating margin is down almost 5% YoY while its adjusted EBITDA margin has declined almost 4%. That decline has negated the impact of the company's revenue strength.The company is trading at a market cap of $800 billion, which in a volatile capex heavy industry means that it needs $80 billion in long-term profits to justify the valuation, or at least a path to that. How do we get that $80 billion number? Not only is it in line with , but when a company stops growing, it's in line with what's needed for .The company's current annual profit is ~$10 billion, or 12% of that. Increasing competition and the company missing its targets, along with declining margins, means that, in our view, the company is not far from peak profit now. We expect continued struggles here and see now realistic path for the company to hit $80 billion.We'd be amiss if we didn't discuss Tesla's other businesses. Namely, full self-driving (FSD) and a potential robotaxi fleet the company states can be the next wave of its industry.The company's initial master plan discussed enabling robotaxi in 2020 pending regulatory approval. Now, as we approach 2024, not only is the company nowhere near full regulatory approval, it's actually fallen out of the lead.  robotaxis from Cruise and Waymo to operate 24/7 offering paid rides, as they already make money.A collision of a firetruck with a robotaxi, as the firetruck was driving in the wrong lane to bypass a red light, also shows  the problem of self-driving vehicles is. Tesla hasn't even reached that level of testing, and when they do, we forecast substantial effort will be needed to operate a profitable taxi fleet in even one city.After that, the company will need to slowly expand outwards to other major cities, with potentially equally strong local opposition. As competition remains strong, we expect it'll realistically take many years for this to be accomplished.For those looking to bet against Tesla, we recommend using a bearish put spread. Buy the Jan 2026 $250/share strike price PUT at $60/share and sell the $200 PUT at the same time for $37/share. Your net outlay is $23/share. That's your downside if Tesla stays at the current price.If Tesla is well below that price, which we expect, your max profit is $27/share if the price is at $200/share or below. Given what we've discussed above, that's by far the more likely scenario in our view. More pessimistic investors can lower their breakeven prices at the cost of lower max losses. The same spread between $150 and $100 costs $12/share, meaning half the outlay and 50% higher potential profit.The major risks of shorting are two-fold. First, the borrow fee. When you sell short, you are selling stock now and buying it back in the future. In exchange, you pay a separate fee for that time period to borrow stock. Borrow  for stock can hit extraordinarily high rates, and those rates can force you to unexpectedly exit a short position.Second, when you short a stock, you have . We never expected Tesla's recent stock price appreciation, and we've been wrong about the company before. The company's market cap could conceivably go up 5x with the right bullish event combination or black swan event. That could take a $1k investment and turn it into a $5k loss, a massive risk.Options as well are , but with the trades above, your risks are capped. We clearly define what those caps and max losses are, but it's worth noting there's a realistic chance you ""lose it all"" in terms of the max loss above.The largest risk to our thesis is a technological breakthrough for Tesla that puts it heads and shoulders above the competition, enabling it to completely dominate the market. Full AI or a major battery breakthrough would be examples of this, but we think that they're incredibly unlikely to happen. Still, it's worth noting.We think Tesla has peaked. Despite the company's incredibly strong performance, YTD the company's valuation has left any sense of reasonableness. The company's ability to ever justify its valuation is incredibly unlikely in our view. Now the company doesn't just face long-term risks, it faces short-to-medium-term risks from China's EV industry.For those interested in betting against Tesla, we recommend shorting Tesla or using a bearish PUT spread.

"This Is No Time For Celebration, The Oil Rally Is Just Getting Started","In our WCTW this Monday, we wrote that the oil market () is not prepared for what's coming. The U.S. has, in essence, bailed out the rest of the world from an oil supply shortage, but that is about to comeWe are already seeing eye-popping backwardation, and there's more to come.If you thought March/April 2022 was bad, you haven't seen the real thing yet. We are talking about real supply cuts this time, not some fantasy potential supply drop.What makes this time even more beautiful is that theAnd similar to the path the IEA took when Russia invaded Ukraine telling the world that Russian oil production would fall by ~3 million b/d, this time around, it is preaching the exact opposite: ample supply.But as the title of this OMF suggests, this is no time for celebration, this is no time for pats on the back, because this is only just getting started.Our latest U.S. crude storage forecast shows non-existent crude builds during refinery maintenance season. We have one last rush of U.S. crude exports and that's it. U.S. crude storage will likely stay flat to higher into year-end because U.S. crude exports will fall. This is what we expect and the end result is a much tighter global oil market environment.So for readers trying to stay ahead of the curve, please do not expect U.S. commercial crude storage to fall well below ~400 million bbls. We are already tight and so the market will force relief one way or another.One of the bear factors was demand, but demand is holding up well. Unlike some of the bulls argue, we don't see demand as being robust, but it's not terrible like the bears are claiming. Refining margins will continue to remain under pressure as crude tightness gets even tighter. Bears will point to falling refining margins as a sign of demand weakness, when in reality, it's just crude tightness.Oil, in the meantime, will continue to climb the wall of worries. Recession, high interest rates, lower refining margins, OPEC+ spare capacity, all of these things will prevent people from seeing the bigger picture, and that's that the marginal supply has all but peaked.And the U.S., being the largest growth in supply over the last decade, is all but on its last leg. The oil market is firmly in the hands of the Saudis and they can do however they please going forward.So this is no time for celebration because it's only just getting started. Buckle up, extreme tightness in the physical market is coming.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, ""."" Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering .

"TotalEnergies: Energy Prices And Russia Drag On Earnings, But Still Decent Company","On Thursday, October 26, 2023, European energy supermajor TotalEnergies SE ()  its third quarter 2023 earnings results. At first glance, these results were mixed, as TotalEnergies managed to beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of revenueThe fact that TotalEnergies' revenues went down year-over-year is not necessarily anything that we need to worry about. After all, it was certainly not the only energy company to have experienced such a phenomenon with respect to its results. Exxon Mobil (), which also reported lastAs long-time readers are no doubt well aware, it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a company's earnings results before delving into an analysis of its results. This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis. Therefore, here are the highlights from TotalEnergies' third-quarter 2023 earnings results:It seems essentially certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights will notice is that many measures of TotalEnergies' financial performance came in weaker during the third quarter of 2023 than they did during the equivalent quarter of last year. One of the biggest reasons for this is that energy prices were lower on average during the most recent quarter than they were during the third quarter of last year. We can see this quite clearly here:We can see that the price of oil did finally start to rise during this quarter following several months of suppression partly caused by the United States Federal Government flooding the market from oil using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Basically, as I  earlier this year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia made the decision to cut crude oil production in order to keep the balance between supply and demand very tight. In effect, what these cuts were intended to do was offset the impact of the sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The cuts remain in this place to this day, yet the Federal Government stopped selling oil from its stockpile back in mid-July. As of right now, there are 351.274 million barrels of crude oil in the nation's storage, which is the lowest level that has been seen since the early 1980s:As such, the United States probably cannot use its national storage stocks to artificially manipulate the price of crude oil anymore. After all, there is a minimum amount of crude oil that needs to be stored in the salt caverns simply to maintain their structural integrity. Thus, with the cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remaining in effect, the balance between the supply and demand for crude oil became tighter and pushed up energy prices.However, we still see in the chart above that the average price of crude oil was lower in the third quarter of this year than during the equivalent quarter of last year. This is reflected in TotalEnergies' results, as the company reported that it received an average of $78.90 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the quarter compared to $93.60 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the equivalent quarter of last year. It should be fairly obvious why this would have a negative impact on TotalEnergies' financial performance. After all, if the company received less money per unit of product sold, then its overall revenue will be lower all else being equal.However, all else is rarely equal with a company like TotalEnergies. As noted in the highlights, the company saw its production decline in the most recent quarter compared to the equivalent one last year. During the third quarter of 2023, TotalEnergies produced an average of 2.476 million barrels of oil equivalents per day. That was a 7.23% decline from the 2.669 million barrels of oil equivalents per day that the company averaged during the year-ago quarter. That also had a negative impact on the company's financial performance. After all, a lower production means that it has fewer products that it can sell in exchange for money.When we combine the company's lower production with the fact that it received less money per unit of product sold, it should be fairly easy to see why the company's revenue would go down from period to period. The decline in revenue generally means that the company has less money available to cover its fixed expenses and similar things, which results in a decline in operating income. That is exactly what we see here.With that said, the company's crude oil production was actually up, even though its total production was down year-over-year:As we can see, crude oil production went up by 101,000 barrels per day on average, which represents a 7.78% increase. This was more than offset by a massive decline in the company's production of natural gas, which decreased its oil-equivalent production overall. Perhaps the biggest reason for this appears to relate to the sanctions that the United States and the European Union have levied on Russia. According to a  that the company issued in March of 2022:The company does not explicitly state in its earnings press release that it was the removal of Novatek () from its results reporting around the end of last year that is responsible for the production decline that we see reflected in these results. However, it seems likely as the company states that its hydrocarbon production went up once Novatek's production is excluded from the year-ago figures. During the third quarter of 2022, TotalEnergies produced an average of 2.356 million barrels of oil equivalents per day excluding Novatek's contribution to its upstream production figures. The company's production excluding Novatek was 2.476 million barrels per day on average during the most recent quarter. That was a 5.09% year-over-year increase. Thus, it seems likely that one major contributor to TotalEnergies' weaker financial performance year-over-year is because of the Russian sanctions that were levied due to the situation in Ukraine.TotalEnergies did benefit from a few new sources of production in the quarter. These include the following projects:The company states that these projects alone increased its year-over-year hydrocarbon production by 5%. While this was partially offset by things such as natural field production declines and the aforementioned problems with TotalEnergies' stake in Novatek, it is still good to see that some projects are coming on that are having a positive impact on the company. Clearly, it is not all bad news here.As I have explained in numerous previous articles:As of the time of writing, interest rates in most developed nations are at the highest rates that have been seen in many years. After all, most developed countries printed enormous amounts of money to help support their economies through the COVID-19 lockdowns and this sparked a worldwide inflation crisis. Most central banks in the Group of Twenty nations have been raising interest rates over the past two years in an effort to combat this inflation crisis. However, TotalEnergies has not really been impacted by rising rates so far. As we can see here, while the company's interest expenses have indeed been rising over the past few quarters, its investment income has also been rising:This is partly due to the fact that energy companies in general have been using some of their good fortunes from supportive energy prices over the past few years to strengthen their balance sheets. That has been quite necessary considering that the market has not been especially friendly to traditional energy companies in general. As might be expected given these two factors, TotalEnergies has been reducing its net debt over the past several quarters:This has allowed the company to offset some of the impact of higher rates as it has a lesser amount of debt upon which it needs to pay financing costs. Meanwhile, the company has kept its cash and cash equivalents at a relatively stable level:This has allowed the company to increase the amount of interest that it collects from things such as money market funds and short-duration bonds. This has helped to offset the added amount of interest that the company needs to pay on the debt that it continues to carry. Thus, the company's net interest expenses have not really been too badly impacted by the rising rate environment. This is certainly a better situation than what we have seen with companies in sectors such as utilities (see ).As is always the case, we should take a moment to have a look at TotalEnergies' financial structure. The usual way that we accomplish this is by looking at the net debt-to-equity ratio. As shown above, TotalEnergies had a net debt outstanding of $26.690 billion on September 30, 2023. On the same date, the company had a total equity of $118.424 billion. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.23 today. Here is how that compares to some of the company's peers:As we can see here, TotalEnergies has considerably more debt than comparable American companies but it does compare reasonably well to its European peers. This is a sign that the company is probably not overly reliant on debt to finance its operations. We should not have to worry too much about the company's debt load, even in today's relatively high-rate environment.TotalEnergies has long been known for offering a relatively high dividend yield compared to many other assets that are available in the market. It is not necessarily alone in this though, as the entire energy sector is one of the highest-yielding sectors in the market. Indeed, the iShares Global Energy ETF (), which tracks a portfolio of major traditional energy companies from around the world currently yields 4.58%, which is substantially higher than many other sector index funds.For its part, TotalEnergies currently has a 4.64% yield so its stock certainly does not disappoint in this respect. After all, there are not very many common stocks that boast such a high yield and have relatively strong forward growth prospects. Unfortunately, TotalEnergies' dividend has not been especially stable over the years:One of the biggest reasons for this is that TotalEnergies declares and pays its dividends in euros, despite the fact that the company actually reports its results in U.S. dollars. The fact that it actually pays the dividend in euros means though that those investors who hold the American Depositary Receipts (which is anyone who buys the shares that trade on an American exchange) receive the U.S. dollar equivalent of the dividend. It is pretty common for foreign companies owned by American investors to have a dividend that fluctuates with exchange rates for this reason.As is always the case though, we want to ensure that the company can actually afford the dividends that it pays out. After all, we do not want to be the victims of an unexpected dividend cut since that would reduce our incomes and almost certainly cause the company's share price to decline.The usual way that we judge a company's ability to cover its dividend is by looking at its free cash flow. During the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2023, TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of $27.2054 billion but only paid out dividends of $7.5940 billion. Thus, the company easily generated more than enough cash through its ordinary operations to cover its dividends.We see the same general thing when we measure the company's free cash flow and dividends in euros. During the twelve-month period, TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of €25.7336 billion but only paid out €7.1832 billion in dividends to the shareholders. Thus, the company is clearly not having any particular difficulty maintaining its dividends. We should not need to worry too much about a potential cut., TotalEnergies will grow its earnings per share at a 9.30% rate over the next three to five years. This gives the stock a price-to-earnings growth ratio of 0.73 at the current price. That suggests that the stock is undervalued at the current price. However, as I have pointed out in a variety of articles and blog posts over the past several months, nearly everything in the traditional energy industry appears to be significantly undervalued right now.Thus, the best way for us to value the company is by comparing TotalEnergies' valuation to its peers in order to determine which stock offers the most attractive relative valuation.As we can see here, TotalEnergies appears to boast a very reasonable valuation relative to many of its peers. This could suggest that the company's stock is worth purchasing today. That is especially true considering the rather strong fundamentals for crude oil, which we have discussed in numerous previous articles here at Energy Profits in Dividends.In conclusion, TotalEnergies' third quarter 2023 earnings results were overall quite decent even if they were worse than the company's numbers during the prior-year quarter. The fact that energy prices were lower in the reporting period compared to 2022 was a major drag on the firm's performance and the sanctions that have been levied by the Western powers on Russia also do not help. Despite this though, TotalEnergies still looks like a reasonable purchase right now as the company's valuation remains attractive and its balance sheet is strong. The fact that it sports a 4.64% yield at the current price only adds to its appeal. Overall, the company may be worth considering today.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Exxon Mobil: Artificially Inflated,"As  () takes on the all-time highs from earlier this year, investors need to remember that oil is at far lower prices now and the world has plenty of supply. The energy giant just printed aWTI crude (CL1.COM) spent most of Q2 trading in the mid-$70 range. When looking at the 5-year chart, oil is trading far above the levels prior to the Russian invasion in early 2022.The Saudis have led an OPEC charge this year to raise prices by cutting oil production. The country just announced plans to keep the  of 1 million barrels per dayThis cut was on top of additional cuts of 1.66 million barrels per day by OPEC members. According to  from Platts and J.P. Morgan, the current spare oil capacity from OPEC+ countries tops 4 million barrels per day and nearly matches the highest levels since at least 2000 outside of the initial Covid demand dip in 2020.With Brent back to $94, our view is that oil prices have an upside to possibly $100. At a triple-digit price, the Saudis are likely pressured back onto the market after publicly stating a need for only $85/b in order to fund the government.As the above chart highlighted, the world doesn't lack spare capacity. Oil prices are only surging due to OPEC+ keeping supply artificially low.Exxon Mobil reported  just over a month ago, providing investors key insights to what normalized earnings look like now after the Russian invasion of Ukraine no longer impacts prices. In addition, the energy giant has cost cuts amounting to an estimated $9 billion since 2019.The company only earned $1.94 per share during the June quarter. The EPS missed analyst estimates by $0.08 and was nearly $1 per share below the prior quarter's level of $2.83 and far below the peak profits.Exxon Mobil provides this handy chart highlighting how Q2 margins were more within the norm of the 10-year average margins, especially for crucial crude and natural gas prices and refining margins. The only segment with below historically normal margins is the Chemical segment.The key dilemma is how to value the stock going forward. Exxon Mobil has an annualized EPS below $8 per share, making a $120 stock price very expensive at over 15x earnings run rate.Analysts have a 2024 EPS target at nearly $9 for a forward P/E multiple of 13x. This EPS target appears more in line with current market prices for oil and natural gas.The real risk to investors is that oil prices have been elevated for 18 months now. The risk is for a cycle of lower oil prices, similar to natural gas now.Considering the spare capacity, oil prices could fall below $70/b and into at least the low $60/b similar to back in 2019. Exxon Mobil would start reporting even lower earnings, knowing the 2019 EPS was only $2 per share.The company has ~4 billion shares outstanding, suggesting the $9 billion in cost savings would in theory add another $2 to EPS potential from the 2019 EPS level. Exxon Mobil would have a $4 earning potential based on 2019 energy prices, assuming all of the cost cuts weren't replaced by additional spending in other categories.The key investor takeaway is that $120 appears the peak price for Exxon Mobil Corporation. The stock is fully valued for elevated oil prices and the risk is now to the downside knowing that oil ultimately ends up at much lower prices over the next cycle.Investors should cash out at current levels and look for a better entry level when OPEC+ no longer has the ability to freely cut output to push oil prices higher.Stone Fox Capital (aka Mark Holder) is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

"APA Corporation: Reasonable Results For Current Times, Set Up For Better H2","On Wednesday, August 2, 2023, independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production giant  ()  its second-quarter 2023 earnings results. At first glance, these results were quite good, as APA managed to beat theIn fact, as we can clearly see above, APA’s stock price has delivered a 26.52% return over just the past month. That is the kind of return that just about any investor will greatly appreciate. With that said though, much of the traditional energy sector has been rising over the period due to crude oil prices finally starting to breakFor most of the second quarter, crude oil prices were under $80 per barrel. The improving price environment will benefit the company going forward, however, so we will probably see its third-quarter performance come in a bit better than it did in the second. The biggest disappointment here is that the company’s stock price may have gotten ahead of itself as APA Corporation currently looks to be more expensive than many of its peers.As regular readers are no doubt well aware, it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a company’s earnings report before delving into an analysis of its results. This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis. Therefore, here are the highlights from APA Corporation’s second quarter 2023 :It seems essentially certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights will notice is that every measure of financial performance declined compared to the prior-year quarter. This is not exactly surprising as it is in line with the reports that have been coming in from across the energy sector. The biggest reason for this is that energy prices were substantially lower during the second quarter of 2023 than they were in the second quarter of 2022. This chart shows the spot market price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil over the period from April 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023:As is immediately visible, the price of the commodity was much lower during the quarter. APA’s second-quarter results were affected by this as well. Here are the company’s realized prices for the products that it sells:The realized price is the average amount that the company received for each unit of production that it sold during the period. As we can clearly see, these numbers were substantially lower across the board. It should be fairly obvious why this would have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance. After all, if it receives less money for each unit of product that it sells, then its total revenue will be lower, all else being equal. The lower revenue means that less money is available to cover the company’s fixed expenses and make its way down to the bottom-line profit and cash flow.Naturally, all else is rarely equal with a company in this industry. This was the case here, as APA Corporation’s production came in higher than during the same quarter of last year. We can see this in the highlights. During the second quarter of 2023, APA Corporation produced an average of 398,930 barrels of oil equivalent compared to 384,627 barrels of oil equivalent in the same quarter of last year. This helped to offset the impact of lower prices. After all, the higher production means that APA Corporation had more products to sell in exchange for money. As is usually the case with an oil company though, the higher production was unable to fully offset the impact of the lower energy prices.As I have mentioned in various previous articles, crude oil prices generally held up much better than natural gas prices over the past year. Over the trailing twelve-month period, West Texas Intermediate is down 6.70% but natural gas at Henry Hub is down a whopping 62.20%. That was caused mostly by natural gas oversupply in the United States due to a warmer-than-normal winter (that resulted in lower-than-usual consumption) and an outage at a major liquefaction plant that would have ordinarily purchased billions of cubic feet of natural gas per day to export overseas. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was lower during the second quarter than it is now, however. In fact, over the past month, crude oil prices have gone up by 14.30%:The current West Texas Intermediate price of $83.14 per barrel is hovering right around its year-to-date high. There are reasons to believe that this positive trend will continue going forward. One reason for this is that the Federal government can no longer flood the market with crude oil in a bid to suppress prices. From about the start of April until the first week of July, Administration officials were selling crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the market:That was almost certainly intended as a way to offset the supply shortage that would have otherwise resulted from the cuts implemented by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries back in April. This is similar to the tactic that officials used to try and manipulate energy prices downward last summer and fall. However, the government never filled up its stockpiles like it said that it would. Therefore, when it started draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in April, it only had a very limited supply of oil that could be sold before the government’s reserves were empty. It appears that we may have hit that point in early July.When the Department of Energy released its crude oil inventory report yesterday, it showed that the amount of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve went up by 995,000 barrels, which is shown in the chart above. That is the largest weekly build since June 2020, and it could be a sign that the Administration is finally starting to refill the nation’s crude oil stockpile. If this continues, not only will we not have an increased supply from the national stockpiles being sold onto the market, but we will also have a significant new source of demand. That could very easily worsen the tight supply-demand balance that already exists in the market due to the OPEC production cuts and drive crude oil prices up.If that scenario plays out, it will certainly prove to be a net positive for APA Corporation. The company stated in its  that 50% of its second quarter 2023 production was crude oil:As stated earlier, APA Corporation had an average production of 398,930 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2023. Its crude oil production alone was 198,831 barrels per day, which represents 49.84% of the total average production so the 50% estimate is certainly a fair estimate. As such, APA will benefit more from crude oil price increases than it will from either natural gas or natural gas liquids because crude oil accounts for the largest percentage of the products that it sells.With that said, natural gas liquids prices typically track crude oil prices, so we could see some near-term increases there. APA’s guidance is for a very slight production increase over the remainder of the year so it should be well-positioned to deliver stronger results in the second half of this year than it did in the first half. That is something that investors in the company should appreciate.It is always important to investigate the way that a company finances its operations before making an investment in it. This is because debt is a riskier way to finance a company than equity because debt must be repaid at maturity. This is typically accomplished by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to repay the existing debt because very few companies have the ability to completely pay off their debt with cash as it matures. This can cause a company’s interest expenses to go up following the rollover depending on the conditions in the market. As interest rates are currently higher than they have been in more than twenty years, that is a very real concern today.In addition to interest-rate risk, a company must make regular payments on its debt if it is to remain solvent. Thus, an event that causes a company’s cash flows to decline could push it into financial distress if it has too much debt. As APA Corporation is highly exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, which can be quite volatile, this is a risk that we should not ignore.One ratio that we can use to analyze a company’s financial structure is the net debt-to-equity ratio. This ratio tells us the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt as opposed to wholly-owned funds. The ratio also tells us the degree to which a company’s equity will cover its debt obligations in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation, which is arguably more important.As of June 30, 2023, APA Corporation had a net debt of $5.5360 billion compared to $1.6960 billion of shareholders’ equity. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 today. Here is how that compares to some of the company’s peers:As we can clearly see, APA Corporation is the only company here whose net debt is higher than its shareholders’ equity. That could be a sign that the company is relying far too heavily on debt to finance its operations. This is something that could pose a real risk to shareholders, particularly as it has to start rolling over debt and paying higher interest rates.Ultimately, a company’s ability to carry its debt is more important than the sheer amount of debt in its financial structure. The usual way that we evaluate this is by looking at its leverage ratio, which is also known as the net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio. This ratio essentially tells us how many years it would take the company to completely pay off its debt if it were to devote all of its pre-tax cash flow to that task.As mentioned in the introduction, APA Corporation reported an EBITDAX of $1.217 billion in the second quarter of 2023. That works out to $4.868 billion annually, which gives it a leverage ratio of 1.14x based on its annualized EBITDAX. This is a reasonable ratio, although the best companies in the sector have a ratio that is less than 1.0x. Thus, APA Corporation is a bit more levered than we really want to be comfortable. Fortunately, the fact that its EBITDAX will almost certainly increase in the near future as already discussed will help here since that will give the company more money to use to reduce its net debt.It is always critical that we do not overpay for any assets in our portfolios. This is because overpaying for any asset is a surefire way to earn a suboptimal return on that asset. In the case of an upstream exploration and production company like APA Corporation, we can value it by looking at the price-to-earnings growth ratio. This is a modified version of the familiar price-to-earnings ratio that takes a company’s forward earnings per share growth into account. A price-to-earnings growth ratio of less than 1.0 is a sign that the stock may be undervalued relative to the company’s forward earnings per share growth and vice versa.According to , APA Corporation will grow its earnings per share at a 1.19% rate over the next three to five years. That gives the company a price-to-earnings growth ratio of 9.29 at the current price. Here is how that compares to the company’s peers:As we can see here, it appears that APA Corporation is incredibly expensive relative to its peers. Admittedly, we could argue that a 1.19% earnings per share growth rate is far too low of an estimate given the trajectory of energy prices. I would even agree with that, and I do expect that this company will be able to deliver a better performance. However, keep in mind that every single company on this list will also benefit from rising crude oil prices. Thus, we can still conclude that APA Corporation is a bit expensive today compared to its peers.In conclusion, APA Corporation reported fairly solid second-quarter 2023 earnings results. These results beat the expectations of analysts, but they were still worse than what the company delivered last year. That was expected as energy prices were significantly lower than they were in the prior-year quarter. This could be about to reverse though, as the fundamentals are pointing to rising energy prices going forward and APA is positioned to take advantage of this. The only real negatives here are that APA Corporation remains expensive relative to its peers, despite having a weaker .

There Might Not Be Another Chance Like This For Years,"There is a crazy mismatch in the market right now as it concerns real estate investment trusts (""REITs"") between  and .Second-quarter REIT earnings releases thus far have been almostCompare the 12-month performance of the Vanguard Real Estate ETF () to that of the S&P 500 () and Nasdaq 100-Index ():The market seems to be convinced that REITs are facing serious and long-lasting headwinds that will meaningfully damage their ability to grow in the long run. Therefore, many investors are avoiding REITs altogether rather than looking for value.We think this pessimistic sentiment basicallyLet's address all three points and finish by taking a look at five high-quality REITs trading at what we view as crazy discounts to their fair values and fundamental performances.On the first point, if you watch financial media for any length of time, you'll inevitably hear commentators equating ""commercial real estate"" with office buildings, and we all know the difficulties facing office real estate right now amid the new hybrid work environment.Even industry insiders sometimes equate the two. See, for example, the title given to this sentiment survey from the Real Estate Roundtable:The survey is about  CRE, but stress in  CRE in particular appears to be dragging down sentiment for all CRE.What about the idea that a big drop in downtown office utilization and values will have a negative effect on the cities in which they're located? Keep in mind that most non-office real estate properties, and most of the properties in REITs' portfolios, are located  of downtown areas.It isn't a big leap in the mind of the average investor to go from ""commercial real estate"" to ""REITs."" You need only look at the occupancy rates of the four main sectors of CRE to discover that REITs do not equal office.While office occupancy has indeed plummeted since the onset of COVID-19, occupancy of apartments, retail, and industrial remains at or near their highs.The market treats REITs as totally helpless in the face of rising interest rates, almost mechanically discounting REITs as rates ratchet higher.But the market seems to forget that REITs have professional management teams whose job it is to maximize rent and minimize interest costs. Most of them do a very good job at this.Hence we find that REITs' total FFO has surged higher since the onset of COVID-19:Moreover, REITs' weighted average debt maturity sits at about 8 years, and (generally speaking) relatively few of their loans mature and require refinancing on any given year. During the low interest rate period of 2020 and 2021, REITs very actively refinanced debt, pushing out maturity dates as far as they could. Many of them, like Alexandria Real Estate () and NNN REIT () refinanced expiring debt with 30-year bonds during that period.That is why the weighted average interest rate on REITs' debt has only barely budged higher in the last year even as interest rates have surged.Of course, the longer interest rates remain elevated, the higher their weighted average interest rates will go. But while higher rates are a short-term headwind, they can be a long-term tailwind, because of the next point.In the long run, higher interest rates (combined with higher labor and construction costs) act as a massive boon to commercial real estate and especially to REITs, because it will result in far fewer new development projects coming to market.As we all learned in Econ 101, the economy is basically operated on supply and demand. If the supply of something stays flat while demand grows, the price typically goes up. This is true of real estate as much as for any other sector of the economy.When interest rates and input costs go up, development of new real estate properties grinds to a halt, which leads to fewer new properties coming to market to compete with the existing stock a year or two down the road.That's exactly what we've seen happening over the last year or so in the CRE development industry.Here's a chart showing sentiment among CRE developers related to their views of whether various components will be higher or lower in 12 months' time.As you can see, over the past year, they have mostly viewed occupancy and rents as headed higher while construction and labor costs have likewise headed higher. Only recently have developers started to see the light at the end of the tunnel for construction costs -- envisioning an end to materials cost increases.What does this do to development activity? It causes much less of it to be greenlit.Take a look at this chart of industrial (on the left) and multifamily (on the right) construction starts going back 10 years:Although starts spiked in 2021 and early 2022, they have since  to very low levels as the costs of land, labor, materials, and capital have soared. The same thing is happening all across the CRE spectrum right now. Very few new projects are breaking ground for any type of real estate.What does this mean for REITs? It means that after the (manageable) wave of new supply of properties comes to market this year and next year, there will be a steep drop-off in 2025-2026 and potentially beyond that.Less supply combined with growing demand should result in rising rent rates.Let's briefly look at five REITs that we believe exhibit this huge mismatch between strong fundamental performance and weak investor sentiment. To illustrate, we'll just use one valuation metric: price to operating cash flow (or ""CFO""), because cash flow is one of real estate's primary channels of delivering returns.First off:  (), a triple-net lease REIT focused on investment grade, single-tenant retail properties leased to the nation's leading retailers like Walmart (), T.J. Maxx (), Tractor Supply Co. (), and Home Depot ().ADC enjoys a BBB credit rating, very little debt maturing before 2028, the highest quality tenant roster in the net lease REIT space, and a skilled management team. And yet, ADC is near its cheapest valuation of any time in the last five years.At a price of around $69, ADC trades at a price to AFFO of 17.5x, compared to its 5-year average of 19.6x.Next up, consider  (), the only pure-play life science REIT that owns and develops state-of-the-art, Class A research & development properties in the nation's most innovative research clusters. The REIT just  an earnings beat on continued strong demand for its top-tier lab space, even if leasing and rent rate growth is normalizing from its elevated, COVID-era levels. ARE also enjoys a BBB+ credit rating and no debt maturing before 2025.And yet, partially in response to activist REIT investor Jonathan Litt's short report, the REIT trades near its lowest valuation in 5 years.At a price of $127.50, ARE trades at a price to AFFO of 16.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 25.5x.Much the same could be said about US-based telecommunications REIT  (), which owns a vast network of wireless towers, small cells, and fiber across the country. The market seems to be focused on the fact that management slightly trimmed AFFO per share guidance for 2023, lowering their growth estimate from 3% to 2%.Moreover, the market also seems pessimistic about management's repeated assertion that CCI will be able to return to growth after 2025, when the last of Sprint's lease cancellations take effect. Given the huge rise in mobile data usage and carriers' need to continue investing to facilitate that traffic, I believe management in their assertion that dividend growth will return to 7-8% annually in 2026 and beyond. In the meantime, CCI's BBB credit rating and modest debt maturities in 2023-2024 exude strength.And yet, CCI's valuation has gone off a cliff:At a price of $112.50, CCI trades at a price to AFFO of 14.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 23.0x.Turning to the self-storage space, we believe one of the strongest names in this area is  (), which recently solidified its scale advantage by acquiring peer Life Storage. EXR now commands the #1 market share in U.S. self-storage at 13.2% of the market. Like ARE, EXR's ultra-strong pandemic-era performance is in the process of normalizing, especially as the housing market cools and fewer people are moving. EXR also enjoys a BBB credit rating and a manageable amount of debt maturing this year and next year.And yet, the market is valuing EXR  than it did prior to COVID-19.At a price of $144.50, EXR trades at a price to AFFO of 17.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 22.3x.Finally, in the industrial space, consider  (), the premier owner of high-quality, infill industrial properties in the extremely supply-constrained Southern California market. Management calls the industrial supply shortage in Southern California ""virtually incurable,"" and this shortage has spurred peer-leading rent and NOI growth. Over the last five years, REXR's NOI has grown at a CAGR of 39%, and after Q2 2023, in-place rents on its existing portfolio remained 50% below market, implying significant organic growth ahead.REXR is truly firing on all cylinders while also enjoying one of the strongest balance sheets in REITdom with a BBB+ credit rating, and yet the market is pricing it significantly  than it was before COVID-19.At a price of $56.75, REXR trades at a price to AFFO of 26.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 39.5x.REIT fundamentals across almost all sectors remain strong, and the decrease in development activity today implies that a favorable supply environment will be in effect in a few years' time. And yet, the market is pricing many top-tier REITs as if growth is coming to an end and temporarily elevated interest rates will permanently eat into REITs' profits.As for us at High Yield Landlord, we will follow the fundamentals, not investor sentiment.If you want full access to our Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us at High Yield Landlord for a We are the largest and best-rated real estate investor community on Seeking Alpha with 2,500+ members on board and a perfect 5/5 rating from 500+ reviews:You won't be charged a penny during the free trial, so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Jussi Askola is the President of Leonberg Capital, a value-oriented investment boutique that consults hedge funds, family offices, and private equity firms on REIT investing.

"EDV: Pricing-In Long-Term Inflation Of 3-4%, Lowering Downside Risk (Rating Upgrade)","Over the past two and a half years, I have had a relatively consistent bearish outlook on the long-term bond market.  in early 2020, this outlook was due to my view that inflation would rise, causing the stock-bond correlationCompared to stocks, bonds are typically more prone to mean reversion. EDV has a solid yield today at 5% compared to the past, allowing investors to earn that high yield on their current investment. If long-term rates eventually decline, EDV should rise back to its previous levels, or at least those during the typical 2010s range, $100-$140, or 66% to 130% higher than its current price. Thus, while its downside risk remains ample, we must consider its positive potential should inflation and other factors. Depending on our assumptions, EDV may be a great investment today or among the worst.Since 2020, there has been a considerable increase in the entirety of the yield curve. Short-term rates have risen more significantly than long-term rates, but only by around 1-2%, whereas the whole curve has increased by ~3-4%. In other words, regardless of the bond's maturity, its yield is likely around 3-4% higher. The Federal Reserve's rate policy effectively sets the short end of the curve, while the long end is more sensitive to economic trends.Treasury bonds also come in ""inflation-securitized"" bonds, which pay a much lower yield but payout any changes to the consumer price index. These lesser-known alternate bonds are essential because they can tell us how much EDV is expected to yield  long-term inflation. For example, in 2020, when rates were meager, this figure almost declined to -1%, meaning EDV had a negative expected return after inflation. It is around 2.54% today, the highest after-inflation return seen in around thirteen years. See below:Fundamentally, EDV is a better opportunity when this figure is higher, so long as we do not expect inflation to continue to run off. Should the inflation outlook continue to increase, then EDV would lose value as rates would likely rise to keep up with the inflation outlook. Importantly, for EDV, short-term changes in inflation are not necessary, but instead, it is the long-term expectations for inflation over the next ~25 years. That figure is almost always around the Fed's 2% target but usually correlates to commodity prices because those inflationary factors are outside the Federal Reserve's control. See below:The long-term inflation outlook is elevated today due to numerous enduring inflation forces. One is the upward pressure on energy prices, coming off very low energy prices during most of the 2010s. Technically, energy commodities like oil and gasoline are about average compared to consumer prices. However, in light of , there is some risk that they will rise higher soon and push the long-term inflation outlook. Secondarily, inflation is likely to remain high over the coming decades due to the government's great need for  inflation due to its extreme debt burden. Even  and a shrinking workforce-to-consumer ratio are expected to continue to promote inflation through chronic (skilled) labor shortages.Inflation today is much lower than it was during the peak last year. Many attribute that change to success in the Federal Reserve's effort to combat inflation through higher interest rates and quantitative tightening. Indeed, those efforts have moderated inflation. QT has also likely significantly lowered EDV's value because the Federal Reserve stopped supporting that market through long-term Treasury purchases. However, historically, inflation can fall before rising even higher. This occurred twice during the 1970s, likely one of the most relevant periods to today in recent history. See below:The core cause of the inflation spikes during the 1970s was the increase in energy prices stemming from the , which occurred to the week, exactly forty years ago. The embargo was caused in protest to the US military support for Israel. Over has once again called on OPEC to pursue this action, starting with shipments to Israel but likely including its allies. In my view, investors must consider the eerily similar events between the situation then and today. Of course, there are key differences. One,  friendly with the US because most of those countries have become much more wealthy since then. Two, the US is a net oil exporter, insulating the US from a global energy crisis if the US reenacts an . Third, immense growth and price declines in the oil toward a glut over the coming decade. Still, should escalations continue, I expect EDV to take a hit since geopolitical pressures amongst commodity exporters are almost always inflationary.The secondary factor facing EDV is the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, the yield curve steepens as the US economy slows, with recessions usually occurring when the curve  territory. Thus, while an inverted curve predicts a recession, a ""re-steepening"" is the best immediate indicator, and that is precisely what we're seeing today. After falling to around -1%, the lowest level since the late 1970s (another parallel), the ""10-2"" curve is now at -16 bps and should reach zero within a month at its current pace. The ""20-10"" curve is relatively flat at 29 bps. See below:The ""20-10"" curve is technically relevant to EDV because its yield will rise and fall with that figure and the ""10-2"" spread. That said, the spread between ultra-long and long-term bonds usually does not change too much over time because inflation and GDP growth expectations are unpredictable after 5-10 years. Still, as in most market cycles, we're seeing a steady re-steeping of the yield curve today, a significant indicator of a recession. Historically, recessions are slightly bullish for EDV because the inflation outlook usually falls during GDP declines. That said, that is more true for the 5-10 maturity segment, not the 20-30 year segment, because inflation expectations are less exposed to short-term economic changes that far out. Still, a sizeable economic depression that lasts a decade, such as that of the 1930s, could be bullish for EDV, as long as the Treasury does not need to monetize debt in such a scenario (a distinct possibility).To that point, one significant anomaly today is the rise in the short-end of the yield curve over recent months despite the steepening yield curve. Usually, the yield curve rises in response to a negative outlook in the Federal Reserve's interest rate changes. In other words, the yield curve increases because investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates while the long end of the curve remains unchanged. However, the short end of the curve is still rising today, but the curve is rising because the long-term rates are increasing more quickly. See below:Historically, rising recession risks cause the Federal Reserve to make dovish shifts to reduce interest rates, bolstering the yield curve. Today, recession odds are very high, but we're not seeing the average declines to the 2-year Treasury rate. Instead, we see even higher long-term rates, pushing ETFs like EDV lower. That is a sign that the bond market is starting to price in a rare ""inflationary recession"" where the Fed cannot cut rates despite a recession due to inflation persistence. That only occurs when supply-side issues in the economy are growing, historically stemming from geopolitical issues (trade conflicts, wars, embargos, etc). Another sign of this is the alarmingly positive correlation between stocks and EDV. See below:In January 2020, when the EDV-S&P 500 correlation was very low,  the correlation would eventually become positive due to a rise in inflation. That is essentially what has occurred since then, despite the many black swan events from 2020 to today. Fundamentally, those black swan events have either decreased inflation (COVID-19) or increased it (the wars, money printing, supply chain, etc); however, I expect long-term inflation will continue to rise fundamentally due to debt and demographics.The most crucial factor for EDV is the long-term outlook in inflation and the shorter-term economic cycle. The fact is that EDV's 25-year maturity makes disinflation from a recession a relatively small but potentially bullish factor. Historically, EDV has risen in value during past slowdowns, but that was partly due to Federal Reserve stimulus efforts, which are currently unlikely. Still, a 1% decline in EDV's yield should cause it to rise by over 25% (and vice versa), so there is bullish potential from EDV, given a recession.I think EDV is more likely at its fair value today after losing half of its value since 2020, as I initially expected. If we assume that bonds ""should"" pay 1-2% over inflation in the long run (a historical norm), and EDV's yield is currently ~5%, then EDV is essentially pricing in 3-4% inflation over the next 25 years. Even if the Federal Reserve is officially targeting a 2% rate, it is highly likely to lift that  at some point soon.With a 120% debt-to-GDP, the US likely is unable to repay its obligations (which are what EDV owns) without diluting the currency over the long run. That could be achieved by allowing inflation to remain slightly elevated for many years, which would be relatively neutral for EDV, given it effectively discounting prolonged 3-4% inflation. However, my concern is that, in a recession, decreased tax receipts combined with skyrocketing interest costs cause the US government to continue to lose . In such a scenario, the situation could quickly become unmanageable, leading to an uncontrolled increase in inflation, which, historically, often occurs with overleveraged fiat-currency governments. Any extreme monetary deviation would make EDV lose all or most of its current value. Therefore, I am not bullish on EDV today. Still, I am not as bearish as earlier this year because it now appears appropriately priced for a reasonable long-term economic scenario.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Kinder Morgan: A Premium Worth Paying,"If you are looking for an incredibly diverse energy play with a solid dividend that is also increasing each year the KMI looks very good right now. The share price has had a couple of bumpy lastThe long-term looks bullish for commodities like both oil and natural gas as the percentage of energy generated from them is still very large. Even if investments increase each year into renewables I think KMI can deliver a significant ROI for investors still. Despite trading at a premium to the sector based on earnings, I find the premium worthwhile to pay given the quality of the dividend and the asset base KMI has. This of course results in me rating KMI a buy currently.Kinder Morgan () stands as a prominent energy infrastructure giant within North America, holding the distinction of being the largest energy infrastructure company in the S&P 500 index. The company operates within the midstream energy sector, boasting a substantial network of approximately 82,000 miles of pipelines, 140 terminals, and a significant storage capacity of 700 billion cubic feet for working natural gas. This extensive infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the energy supply chain, facilitating the efficient transport and storage of crucial resources.The company has managed to gather a massive amount of which has made them a leader and almost market mover in the natural gas space. KMI's vast pipeline network transports a diverse range of essential products, including natural gas, refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil condensate, CO2, and various other valuable commodities. Furthermore, the company's versatile terminals play a crucial role in storing and managing a wide spectrum of goods, encompassing gasoline, diesel fuel, renewable fuel feedstocks, chemicals, ethanol, metals, and petroleum coke.This diverse set of exposure is perhaps where some investors are discouraged but some are also encouraged. What I mean by this is that KMI may not see the same immediate and rapid impact of rising commodity prices as a more pure-play natural gas company may. On the other hand, though, KMI is more protected against downside risk in my opinion as the diversified nature of the business lends itself to some price hedging.One of the key features of KMI is its setup with cash flows. The company has an FCF margin of 8.87% right now which is right around where the 5-year average has been as well. As seen in the picture above, KMI has managed to establish a predictable set of cash flows as 61% of it is made of take-or-pay.The for KMI continues to be a highlight in my opinion. The company has an FWD yield of 6.62% and that is sufficient to yield a strong ROI for investors, especially when combined with general share appreciation from growing the EPS of the business. The natural gas prices have come down quite a lot as we know, but I think the trend forward is upwards. The of Mexico's imports of natural gas is adding momentum to the price I think. Even though KMI has a very high payout ratio the company still managed to improve its financial position. Back in 2016, the company had a net debt position of $38 billion, but this has since decreased to $31 billion instead.The world population is continuously increasing and this is putting pressure on the energy outputs as well. Natural gas and oil remain to be very viable sources of it. In the coming couple of decades, I think that they will remain in a dominant position in energy generation. The capital necessary to switch them out to renewables is incredibly high and the material costs and amount of work are too high to make possible in a short period. This means the market is still appealing to invest in as demand will be persistent.Looking at hydrocarbons in applications like cement, steel, and fertilizer they are irreplaceable. Seeing as these are materials and commodities widely used in our societies they will likely remain in high demand. A rising population is also bringing a higher need for housing. That should bring up demand for commodities like cement and steel, which in turn raises demand for hydrocarbons, ultimately benefiting companies like KMI.Some investors may perceive a challenge with KMI due to its diversified business portfolio. This diversification means that KMI may not be able to concentrate its efforts on a specific sector or region for focused expansion. For those seeking a more specialized or pure-play investment, KMI might not be the most suitable option.Significant risks for KMI include the potential impact of low commodity prices, which can lead to reduced oil and gas drilling activity. Moreover, persistently high-interest rates can increase the cost of undertaking new projects, impacting KMI's operations. Additionally, competition from foreign markets for LNG and refined exports poses another risk factor for the company's profitability. I think however that as we are heading into the colder months of the year, the prices of these commodities will rise as they often due. In terms of natural gas prices, I think it's unlikely we see a rapid return to where they were in 2022. The war in Ukraine made the gas market incredibly vulnerable and there were a lot of uncertainties which resulted in the price shooting up the way it did.I think this article has made it quite clear that I like KMI and the value that can be extracted right now. The share price is trading at a 47% premium based on earnings. On a p/b basis though, KMI has a discount of 25% right now. I find the dividend possible to be maintained and the long-term fundamental demand for natural gas should drive higher earnings for KMI.The share price is down on a 12-month basis and I think investors compounding a position in KMI right now will do very well over the long term, possibly yielding a return far higher than the rest of the markets. If it's not clear, I am rating KMI a buy right now and look positively on the next several decades of operations for it   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Unit Corporation: Small Company With Tons Of Cash And Big Dividends,"I am recommending Unit Corporation () as a buy primarily due to its impressive 227% increase in operations income, 150% increase in cash from operations, and the elimination of all of its debt between DecemberThe vast majority of my figures come directly from UNTC's 2022  and UNTC's 2023 Q2 . If the reader wishes to look into these documents further, I have provided links for you to reference.Founded in 1963, Unit Corp. began as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company and has since grown into a corporation that is now involved with oil and natural gas exploration and production as well as holding a 50% stake in a midstream pipeline company. UNTC's operations are broken down into three basic business segments which consist of:These 3 segments, as of December 31st, 2022, employed 653 people. 512 of them working in the contract and drilling business, 102 in the oil and natural gas business, and 39 people employed under UNTC's general corporate group.UNTC's subsidiary Unit Drilling Company had an exciting amount of growth between 2021 and 2022 with a 94% increase in revenue from $76.1 million to $147.7 million. A convergence of an increase in day rate contracts year over year (39% on their BOSS rigs and 23% on their SCR rigs) and a 50% increase in average number of drilling rigs in use being the primary cause.The oil and natural gas segment ran under the subsidiary Unit Petroleum saw a 20% increase in year over year revenue from $272.2 million to $326.2 million. These Unit Petroleum revenue increases came from higher commodity prices. Oil prices increased 15% to $57.48 per barrel in 2022 and the average Henry Hub real natural gas price rose 53% and ranged from $9.85 MMBtu to $3.46 MMBtu from June of 2021 to June of 2022.On March 1st 2022 Superior Pipeline L.L.C. was deconsolidated from UNTC's revenue figures and therefore the revenue figures captured on UNTC's 2022 10-K only reflect the first two months of the year leading to a 76% decrease in revenue from $341.7 million to $83.2 million and a 74% decrease in operating costs year over year from $286 million to $73.8 million.Overall these substantial gains led to a 125% year over year operating income increase from $76.3 million to $172 million and a 196% increase in earnings from continuing operations from $48.2 million to $142.5 million from 2021 to 2022.UNTC's drilling revenues continued to see an exciting amount of growth in 2023. A 49% ($30.8 million) increase in revenue brings Unit Drilling Company to $93.3 million in revenue for the first 6 months of 2023 from $62.5 million in revenue earned during the first six months of 2022. Average day rate increases of 50% on Unit Drilling's BOSS rigs and a 34% average day rate increase on their SCR rigs are the primary drivers of UNTC's drilling business revenue growth while its contract drilling operating costs only increased a mere 3% during the same time period.UNTC subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company saw a large 58% decrease in revenues during the first six months of 2023 due to a trifecta of sinking natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil prices from all-time highs in the first half of 2022, mixed with UNTC's large sell off of drilling properties in 2021 and 2022 which by default also led to lower production numbers. UNTC has expressed a lot of interest in selling off large parts of its volatile gas and oil business and in 2021 sold off $23.4 million worth of gas and oil wells before doubling that number to $49 million worth in 2022. 2022's well sell off accounted for 21% of Unit Petroleum's total oil and natural gas properties. That 21% of its properties Unit Petroleum sold off corresponds rather perfectly to the 21% reduction in natural gas production, 23% decrease in oil production, and 31% decrease in natural gas liquids production Unit Petroleum also experienced. The remaining productive properties suffered from declining commodity prices. The average price for a barrel of oil fell 27%, the price of natural gas liquids fell 47%, and natural gas prices tumbled 60% all while the cost of operations only decreased by 37% to $32.4 million from $51.6 million in the first six months of 2022.All of these changes and sell offs to UNTC's businesses led to $78.2 million in income from operations during the first six months of 2023 compared to $130.8 million in income from operations in the first six months of 2022. The major reason UNTC's income from operations contracted so sharply in the first six months of 2023 is because Superior Pipeline was still being listed under operations income until March of 2022 which provided UNTC with an additional $82.7 million in revenue during Q1 of 2022 as well as the company selling off interest in 727 wells in 2022 from its oil and natural gas business.As mentioned above UNTC has been committed to selling off non-core or non-productive assets within its various businesses and sold off $12.7 million worth of non-core contract drilling assets in 2021 and $12.8 million drilling assets in 2022 leading to a net gain of $10.1 million in 2021 and $8.4 million in 2022. In 2021 UNTC saw its oil and natural gas business Unit Petroleum sell off various gas and oil wells and related leases in several states with cash proceeds net of customary closing and post-closing adjustments amounting to $23.4 million. In 2022 UNTC doubled the amount of gas and oil wells and related leases sold to $49 million worth. Other non-core oil and natural gas assets sold off for $5 million in 2021 and $7.7 million in 2022. UNTC also saw interest income of $2.6 million in 2022 compared to $0 in 2021 because of its larger cash holdings from its larger income and asset sales. Net income increased 145% from $60.6 million to $148.4 million from 2021 to 2022.In April of 2023, UNTC sold its 50% stake in Superior Pipeline for $20 million. Unit received $12 million at the closing of the sale and is entitled to the other $8 million 12 months after the date of sale. In May of 2023 UNTC closed on the sale of two of its SCR drilling rigs for $5.8 million as the company reduces its fleet to taper down to what it projects will be the future demand for oil and gas. UNTC also sold off $9.5 million in other non-core assets in its drilling business in the first six months of 2023 and another $1 million in non-core assets from its oil and natural gas business.The company did spend a lot of time narrowing down its business focus over the last three years. By selling off $73.4 million worth of its wells from its oil and gas business, $40.8 million worth of its drilling business assets in the past two and a half years, and selling all of its stake in Superior Pipeline in 2023 UNTC is setting itself up for a more streamlined business model focused primarily on the less volatile contract drilling segment of its operations.UNTC's net cash from operating activities in 2022 was $159.4 million compared to $176 million in net cash in 2021. This $16.6 million decrease (9.4%) can be attributed to the absence of operating cash flows from Superior Pipeline after March 1st 2022 and from higher payments on derivative settlements. 2021 was the first year showing a positive net income for UNTC since 2017 with a $60.6 million of net income in 2021 jumping all the way to $148.4 million in 2022 while at the same time UNTC's debt shrank from $65.3 million in 2021 to just $4.8 million in 2022. A reduction in all of its debt should give UNTC a lot of freedom in future financial decisions as they won't be as sensitive to how future interest rate hikes will affect their interest and principle payments on their current debt load.The first six months of 2023 saw Unit Corp. earn $162.7 million in net income vs. $27.4 million in the first six months of 2022 and UNTC ended its second quarter with $199.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents with a positive working capital balance of $207.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents jumped 72.8% from 2022's $115.6 million and will be used to pay out two $2.50 dividends later this year, one during the third quarter and one during fourth quarter of 2023.The $2.50 dividend paid out on June 26th, 2023 cost UNTC $24.1 million so two more $2.50 payments will likely use up somewhere between $48 - $50 million from UNTC's pile of cash. Even after another hefty 2 dividend payments UNTC should still be sitting on close to $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and management should use this liquidity to offer up more dividend payments and stock buybacks. Even after Q3 and Q4's dividend payments UNTC will still be holding onto a record amount of cash that is unprecedented when looking at the company's history. It is also holding onto this much cash while getting rid of large sections of its business and it is on this basis that my argument for an increase in either buybacks or dividends rests, primarily because a sell off of their business assets should correlate to less capital expenditure used in their remaining businesses.In 2022, the average number of drilling rigs Unit Drilling utilized went from 10.9 to 16.4 raising its oil rig utilization rate from 36% in 2021 to 78% in 2022. On top of more drilling rigs coming into operation UNTC's average revenue per day increased from $19,097 to $24,619.UNTC's subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company had a $47 million decrease in proved oil and natural gas properties from 2021 to 2022 from $225 million to $177 million. This decrease on property value comes from UNTC's announcement that it had expanded its 2021 divestiture program to include potentially the sale of all of its oil and natural gas properties and reserves. While UNTC did end the relationship with the financial advisor it had hired to advise them through these sales in June of 2022 they did see the sell off of all of their Texas Gulf Coast oil and gas properties and related leases for $45.4 million as well as the sale of wells and related leases near the Oklahoma pan handle worth $3.6 million. Thus far in 2023 Unit Petroleum has only made $1 million in proceeds from the sale of its non-core oil and natural gas assets.Unit Corp owned a 50% stake in Superior Pipeline L.L.C. and acted as an operator to the company under its subsidiary company SPC Midstream Operating, L.L.C. where UNTC received $300,000 a month to provide Superior Pipeline with operations and maintenance support, accounting, legal, and human resource services. Superior's value as of March 1st, 2022 is listed under the equity section of UNTC's balance sheet which would explain their $175.2 million increase in common equity from $187.4 million to $362.6 million from 2021 to 2022. In April of 2023, UNTC sold its 50% stake in Superior Pipeline for $20 million.Aided largely by their drilling business segment's massive increase in revenue from having more rigs active in the field and from the sales of their oil and natural gas properties and related leases UNTC saw a 234% increase in cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheet from $64.1 million in 2021 to $214 million 2022.As of June 30th, 2023 UNTC has had a 6.6% decrease in cash and cash equivalents to $199.8 million, however UNTC also has $7.9 million in notes receivable at the end of June 2023 compared to no notes receivable at the end of 2022. Bringing this into account UNTC should soon have $207.7 million in cash on hand bringing the total realistic cash decrease down just 2.9% from the end of 2022. This change in cash isn't significantly surprising when taking into account how much in dividends UNTC has paid out so far in 2023 and in fact, UNTC still has a significant amount of liquidity for future dividend payments and or stock buybacks.Currently, UNTC has no debt and in the first six months of 2023 paid only $335,000 in income taxes. Operating costs for all business segments either decreased or remained practically unchanged when comparing the first six months of 2022 to the first six months of 2023. Superior Pipeline's operating costs are completely non-existent as UNTC has completely parted ways with the company selling off its 50% stake this past April. Unit Petroleum's oil and natural gas business, due to its large well sell offs in 2022, has reduced its operating costs by 37% from $51.6 million in 2022 to $32.4 million in 2023. The only segment to increase its operating costs in the first six months of 2023 is Unit Drilling which saw a slight 3% rise of $1.8 million from $52 million to $53.8 million.When recommending stocks the biggest influence I take into account is a companies' ability to weather adverse events concerning its general business climate. UNTC's impressive ability to repay its debt and therefore reduce its interest payments on any debt it may have to refinance in the future gives an enormous advantage to UNTC in these next few years of interest rate uncertainty. Its ability to clean up its balance sheet over the past few years is a key factor as to why I am recommending this stock as a buy but, UNTC is still subject to some industry wide uncertainty that could hamper investors' ability to realize gains from this undervalued stock. Like all oil producers, OPEC+'s ability to set and support production levels for oil greatly impacts global oil demand and pricing. Global oil and gas demand could also plummet if China's economic recovery continues to stagnate and plunges the rest of the world into a recession in which case UNTC could see a reduced demand for its drilling contracts and lower prices for its oil and natural gas business segments. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also throw curve balls at future global oil and natural gas prices that markets have not factored in yet.Adverse climate effects in the United States can greatly influence demand for oil and natural gas as well. Uncharacteristic weather patterns could increase demand but may also reduce UNTC's ability to deliver its products and services to its customers. Large hurricane events can shut down off shore oil rigs and spike oil prices.  can cause a surge in oil and natural gas demand uncharacteristic of normal seasonal forecasts and as we saw in 2022  for natural gas. While derivates contracts limit future losses in the event that oil and natural gas prices fall derivates contracts also limit UNTC's ability to realize dramatic spikes in oil and gas prices as well and acts as a sort of insurance policy against extreme pricing volatility.In January of 2023 UNTC announced and paid out a special cash dividend of $10.00 a share returning a total of $96.1 million to shareholders. On June 26th, they returned another $24.1 million to shareholders through a $2.50 dividend payment and as of August 10th, 2023 UNTC has approved two more $2.50 dividend payments, one in the third and the other in the fourth quarter of 2023, the exact payment dates have yet to be announced. This leaves UNTC with a current annual dividend yield of 19.96%. Should UNTC not follow through on future dividend payments or stock buybacks after posting 2024's 10-K I would strongly consider selling this stock especially if its stock price performance remains flat.In June of 2021 UNTC began announcing it was buying back $25 million in outstanding common stock. Over the course of the next year Unit made two more announcements, one in October of 2021 increasing the buyback figure to $50 million, and one in June of 2022 further increasing UNTC's funds for stock buybacks all the way up to $100 million. This was accompanied by an impressive  in natural gas prices in 2021 and a  in natural gas prices in 2022 which helped propel UNTC's stock from under $10 in early 2021 a share to $64 in August of 2022.UNTC's stock is currently experiencing a slump when compared to its 2022 performance. The stock had hit an all-time high at $65.75 in January 2023 shortly after the company announced its $10 special dividend payment and then slumped downwards hobbling around $40.00 until May of 2023 before beginning to shoot up again after the announcement of a $2.50 dividend payment in June 2023. You can see UNTC's stock price jumping sharply though briefly the week of August 10th after UNTC announced that it had approved two more $2.50 dividend payments, one in Q3 of 2023 and another in Q4 of 2023.The price of natural gas tanked dramatically in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. Henry Hub natural gas prices were just over $9 per MMBtu in the middle of 2022 to $2.18 per MMBtu in June of 2023. Prices are expected to peak in 2023 at $3.44 per MMBtu in December and it does look like we have bottomed on natural gas prices as our supply chains readjust production and as the winter months of 2022 and 2023 had been abnormally warm reducing the need for natural gas consumption to heat homes. At the same time that natural gas prices appear to be stabilizing the price of a barrel of crude oil is rising.This convergence of more stable natural gas prices, higher oil prices, and UNTC getting rid of a substantial portion of its oil and natural gas wells in 2022 before natural gas had bottomed so it can focus on the more stable segments of its business (drilling) should help UNTC's stock begin to trend upward again. This seems all the more likely knowing that UNTC still has a large pile of cash in its war chest for further buybacks and dividend payments and may be further interested in selling off more of its natural gas assets now that the sale of Superior Pipeline has gone through.When compared to peers YPF Sociedad Anónima (), OMV AG (), Repsol S.A. ADR (), Ecopetrol S.A. (), and Imperial Oil Limited () on seeking alpha you can see UNTC's impressive earnings margins. A 47.9% return on assets compared to their peers' 5.9% to 16.7% range. A return on total capital of 35.4% as compared with peers' 4.1% to 16.5% range. An EBIT margin of 48.28% is also well above other comparable oil and gas peers with most others coming in between 6.9% and 34.1%. Gross profit margins and net income are therefore predictably higher as well with gross profit margins of 54% vs 18.6% to 41.2% and a net income margin way above their peers of 70.3% versus a 3.9% to 15.4% range.The extreme case of net income outpacing the rest of UNTC's peers by so much can be attributed to their massive sell off of property as well as entire businesses, but even so it is clear that UNTC has, by selling off unproductive or non-core assets and by paying off all of their debt, aligned themselves with a highly profitable low leveraged business model that has an open path to a more sustainably profitable future. These earnings margins offer in some sense a margin of safety to UNTC for in the event of an economic downturn. They have less of a chance of going belly up like many oil and gas companies did as a result of the 2014 - 2016 slump in oil prices. The ability to weather adverse events as just described while their peers go out of business would lead to UNTC absorbing a higher percentage of business in the oil and gas industry, clearing the way for future growth.If adverse business conditions become too great a risk for the company UNTC can just sell off the remainder of its businesses for a handsome profit. With a market cap of $473.5 million and current cash holdings of $199.8 million at the end of June 2023 UNTC should be able to sell the rest of its business segments for more than they're worth on paper. Patterson-UTI Energy () bought 17 oil rigs from Pioneer Energy Services Corp. () in 2021, 16 of which were super spec rigs similar to UNTC's BOSS rigs. At the time day rates for the utilization of these oil rigs ran around $17,000 and  Day rates currently sit at $31,990 a day for UNTC's 14 Boss rigs and $22,981 a day for their SCR rigs. After subtracting UNTC's $199.8 million worth of cash from their market cap you have $273 million in market cap value left to account for. This is right in line with the value that would, based off of the Pioneer Energy Services Corp. transaction, be paid out if UNTC sold off the rest of their drilling fleet. This leaves UNTC's entire oil and gas business Unit Petroleum as pure profit for shareholders should UNTC liquidate itself and return its full value to shareholders.I believe for the reasons previously stated that UNTC is a buy. Its earnings from operations and cash from operations have both shown an impressive increase this year while UNTC simultaneously continues to slim down its business model to focus on Unit Drilling, its most stable business segment with the most predictable growth. It's cash holding are currently near record highs even with an impressive amount of dividend payments in 2023 and some stock buybacks in 2022 which should translate to future dividend payments and buybacks as UNTC further slims down its business. Oil prices and demand are currently surging and UNTC has good price leverage on their BOSS oil rigs which continue to consistently increase their day rates with ease. Leaving the Superior Pipeline business and shrinking their exposure to the oil and natural gas business while focusing on drilling lessens their risk to the more volatile parts of the fossil fuel industry and enables them to focus on sustainable long term growth.While the Dividend payments and stock buybacks have been nice I do think that there is more to come from UNTC's massive $199.8 million pile of cash. Buybacks could ensure the stock retains its relative value while the company narrows its business interests and even with two more $2.50 dividends due before 2024, I believe UNTC will likely present another large special lump sum dividend payment early next year.Should UNTC not follow through on future dividend payments or stock buybacks after posting 2024's 10-K I would strongly consider selling this stock especially if its stock price performance remains flat. If you don't necessarily like dealing with the volatility that comes with the fossil fuel industry a good time to consider selling UNTC's stock in the future is after a stock price spike that may occur after UNTC announces other large dividend payments. While its stock should increase in price generally as natural gas prices improve and as oil prices continue to rise an excellent exit point may be created sometime early in 2024 as UNTC looks over their annual figures and historically makes large and exciting announcements to its shareholders. UNTC has enough available cash on hand to issue another $10.00 dividend payment and the stock shot up past $65.00 after UNTC announced the previous $10.00 dividend payment. If UNTC's current stock price of $49.90 shot up to $65.00 shareholders buying in at today's price would realize a 30.3% gain on top of a current annual dividend yield of 19.96%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Exxon Mobil: The Clear Beneficiary Of The Oil Shortage,"We expect oil prices to remain high in 2023 in part due to voluntary production cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia, which we expect to lead to an oil deficit in the second half of 2023. GainsWe have taken into account that in 2023 demand for oil in countries excluding China, the US and the EU is set to rise by 1.2 mbd y/y (the average between the estimates by the  and ). We also expect demand in China to grow by an average of 1In our forecast for oil market balance, we have factored in weaker demand in China in June 2023 and higher-than-expected oil demand in the US, EU and other countries. At the same time, the outlook for oil prices remained unchanged. We expect oil to remain in short supply globally from now until the end of the year, even with a recession in the EU and the US (thanks to the OPEC+ deal and voluntary cuts).We anticipate that Brent oil prices will average $84.6/bbl in 2023, with the price tentatively going up from $82.3/bbl in 3Q 2023 to $96.2/bbl in 4Q 2023 and $100/bbl in 1Q 2024.We believe that oil prices have bottomed out and will continue to rise through the end of the year. We do not expect them to fall below $70 in the medium term, despite the recession (which we expect in the coming months), due to voluntary production cuts in  and  (in July-August). We expect the Brent price to rise to $100.0/bbl by 4Q 2023 as the recession winds down and growth in demand exceeds growth in global oil production.Every quarter, Exxon Mobil sells about 70% of its natural gas output outside the US. In 2Q 2023, most purchases of natural gas were made by Asia (45%), the US (30%) and Australia & Oceania (16%). The EU made up about 6%.According to the latest data from Trading Economics, the Manufacturing PMI in all of the abovementioned top regions (; ; ; ) fell below 50 by July, indicating a decline in new orders in the manufacturing industry and therefore lower gas demand.The 2022/23 heating season for Asia, North America, and the EU  with the remaining reserves exceeding the five-year average for this metric by 20% to 67%. These higher levels were made possible by the following reasons:Lower demand for pumping gas into storage during the summer of 2023 could lead to weaker market fundamentals, primarily related to gas demand.According to the latest data from , North American gas consumption will decline by about 2.9% in 2023. In the US, slowing economic growth is reducing industrial gas demand, and unseasonably mild weather in 1Q 2023 meant lower gas consumption in the residential and commercial sectors, adversely impacting the full year outlook. Slower economic growth along with the rapid development of the renewable energy sector will tamp down gas demand from power plants, although the ongoing transition from coal to gas may mitigate this trend.Gas demand in the 22 EU countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is forecast to decrease by 5%. That’s largely because of lower gas consumption in the power sector, which is set to decline by almost 15% amid rapid development of the renewable energy industry. Industrial gas consumption is expected to recover by almost 5% as lower gas prices allow demand to bounce back in the second half of the year. Given the decline seen in the first quarter, residential and commercial gas demand is expected to fall by 4% in 2023.Gas consumption in Asia slowed by an unprecedented 2% in 2022 due to high LNG prices, downtime related to Covid-19 in China and mild weather for most of the year in Northeast Asia. This trend continued in January 2023, with a 2% decline from a year earlier. In 2023, growth of gas demand in Asia is forecast to resume at a moderate pace of 3% due to the repeal of the zero-Covid policy in China, the expected normalization of weather conditions and a moderate recovery in gas consumption in India and developing countries of Asia after a sharp decline in 2022.Given the falling demand for gas, we are lowering the forecast for Exxon Mobil’s gas sales from 1506 thousand barrels per day (on oil-equivalent basis) to 1358 thousand barrels per day for 2023 and from 1599 thousand barrels per day to 1383 thousand barrels per day for 2024. The forecast for Exxon Mobil’s oil sales has remained unchanged. As a result, the forecast for the combined average volume of oil and gas sales fell from 3964 thousand barrels per day to 3791 thousand barrels per day for 2023, and from 4098 thousand barrels per day to 3880 thousand barrels per day for 2024.As a result of the changes in gas sales volumes, the decreasing projected gas prices and rising projected oil prices, we are slightly lowering the EBITDA forecast from $88.1 bln (-14% y/y) to $87.5 bln (-15% y/y) for 2023, but raising it from $103.9 bln (+18% y/y) to $115 bln (+31% y/y) for 2024.We are raising the target price of the shares from $113 to $137 due to:Exxon Mobil is one of the beneficiaries of the increased oil shortage that’s expected in the second half of 2023. Despite the current decline in gas demand due to high gas storage capacity, we have to wait for the winter and go through the 2023/2024 heating season, the weather conditions of which will determine how strong the gas demand will be. At this point, the company’s shares are fairly valued by the market.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"If I Could Only Own 7 REITs, It Would Be These","I own a lot of real estate investment trusts (""REITs""). As of the end of July, I own 18 individual REITs.Some would say that 18 REITs is too many -- that I would still be able to achieve all the benefitsTo this I would respond that all 18 of the REITs I own are great businesses with fantastic real estate, smart investment philosophies, skilled and shareholder-aligned management teams, modest or low leverage, strong costs of capital, and bright future growth prospects.The ""over-diversification"" criticism may make sense in theory, but not when one has a sufficient level of knowledge and conviction about the companiesBesides, the point in owning 18 REITs is not  per se. It's . As Warren Buffett has wisely said:If diversification is your goal, it would probably be better simply to own an ETF or mutual fund rather than individual stocks.For example, if you'd like real estate exposure, consider buying the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (). It has quite a good history of generating total returns. From the mid-2000s until COVID-19, it even outperformed the S&P 500 ():But I would not recommend buying individual stocks, REITs, or assets simply for diversification's sake.Imagine the silliness of someone saying, ""You know, I'm not particularly bullish on _____ (gold, bitcoin, emerging market bonds, private equity companies, commercial real estate, etc.), but I'd better own some anyway for the sake of diversification."" If that is your thinking, I would urge you to seek the counsel of a registered investment advisor.With all of the preceding said, I have been asked in the past by REIT newcomers where to start looking for great REITs. Sometimes the question is phrased as which handful of top-tier REITs they should research first. Other times, it's phrased as, ""Austin, if you could only own five REITs, what would they be?""That's a great question. I've tried to narrow it down to five in the past and simply haven't been able to distill it to that nice, round number without feeling like I've excluded other, equally high-quality names.But I do think that seven of my 18 REITs are a tier above the others -- true best-in-class businesses in their respective sub-sectors.In what follows, I'll give a brief pitch for each of these seven REIT all-stars and try to articulate what gives them their own respective competitive advantages.ADC is a net lease REIT specializing in single-tenant, primarily freestanding properties leased to the nation's largest, strongest, and fastest growing retailers. In fact, ADC is one of the largest landlords to retailers like Walmart (), Tractor Supply Company (), Dollar General (), and Best Buy ().These are companies that are not only able to survive the growth in e-commerce, they are themselves at the leading edge of technologically enabled retail commerce through mobile ordering, home delivery, curbside pickup, and so on.And Walmart's swiftly advancing drone delivery capabilities look like they are progressing even faster than those of Amazon ().ADC owns prime real estate leased to the cream of the crop in the retail world.But that's only one aspect of ADC's best-in-class character. Another is the balance sheet and cost of capital advantage.ADC constantly maintains a relatively low leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA almost always under 5x, which is quite low for real estate investments) as well as pool of forward equity to tap for investments. These multi-hundred-million dollar forward equity deals are locked in at a certain price, allowing ADC to go out and find investments that will be accretive to that price.In addition, ADC enjoys a BBB credit rating, and the debt it has secured in recent years is often priced as if the REIT had an even higher credit rating than that. With this low cost of capital, ADC is able to bid competitively for the best real estate. Well-located properties leased to top-tier retailers naturally bear higher pricing and lower yields, and ADC is now one of the few players in its space that is still able to invest accretively.Moreover, amid elevated interest rates, ADC's fortress balance sheet is a massive strength. Almost no debt matures until 2028.Lastly, it's noteworthy that ADC is led by its forward-thinking and outspoken CEO, Joey Agree, whose interests are about as aligned with shareholders as a chief executive's possibly could be.Named after the Egyptian city that was once a center of knowledge and science, exemplified by the Library of Alexandria, ARE's buildings are a modern-day facilitator of the advancement of knowledge and science.ARE is the only pure-play owner and developer of state-of-the-art, Class A life science (laboratory research) facilities on the public markets. These beautiful and technologically advanced buildings are located in the most productive and innovative research clusters in the nation such as Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, and the Research Triangle in North Carolina.Amid an oncoming wave of new life science supply coming online in the next few years as owners of older office buildings convert space from traditional office use to laboratories, it's important to recognize ARE's competitive advantages in this industry.With a weighted average debt maturity over 13 years, no debt maturing before 2025, and substantially all (>99%) of debt at fixed interest rates, ARE's balance sheet is enviably strong.Finally, ARE continues to be led by Chairman and co-founder Joel Marcus, who oversees a top-notch management team with a stellar history of generating shareholder value.CCI owns and operates one of the most extensive networks of telecommunications infrastructure in the United States, including over 40,000 towers, about 120,000 small cell nodes, and 85,000 route miles of fiber.While demand for and supply of towers might be growing faster in certain developing markets, I like CCI's exclusive focus on the US, for several reasons:As I explained in my last :Each tower or small cell has an initial cash yield on invested capital, and that will slowly rise over time as the annual rent escalations take effect. But CCI can also co-locate multiple tenants on the same infrastructure asset for little to no incremental cost, which significantly pushes up its yield on investment.Notice above how CCI's tower segment has grown its cash YOI year-over-year. This is from densifying its towers with multiple tenants. CCI's average number of tenants per tower is currently 2.5, but there's room for that to go up as the four largest carriers (including Dish Mobile ()) continue to invest in their networks.With mobile data usage projected to grow at a double-digit pace over the next decade from increased video streaming, ridesharing, mobile gaming, Internet of Things, self-driving cars, etc., I believe CCI's irreplaceable infrastructure portfolio has many years of growth still ahead of it.EGP owns and develops multi-tenant, shallow-bay logistics and distribution facilities in multi-building industrial campuses located in infill locations of Sunbelt markets.What does all that terminology gobbledygook mean? Let's break it down:EGP boasts great locations in fast-growing cities in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, and the Carolinas, as well as a strong presence in extremely supply-constrained, low-vacancy California markets. Texas, Arizona, and Southern California also have the added benefit of proximity to Mexico, as recent government policies have spurred a wave of near-shoring to countries like our Southern neighbor.As I explained in ,In order to fulfill their promises of quick delivery times, e-commerce players and business-to-business companies alike  to have logistical facilities located within the city itself, which is what makes EGP's infill locations so valuable.Like the other REITs in this list, EGP also enjoys a strong balance sheet and cost of capital. Only 18% of its total capitalization is in the form of debt, with 100% of that being fixed-rate debt. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio sits comfortably at 4.4x, and that should fall further as the company plans to issue more equity than debt for growth investments this year.MAA owns and develops a diversified portfolio of apartment complexes across the Sunbelt. Its communities span from downtowns to the suburbs and satellite cities. In terms of amenities and price points, its assets range from high-end luxury (Class A+) to affordable workforce housing (Class B-). And in terms of building types, its portfolio is heavily weighted towards low-rise, garden-style communities with exposure to mid-rise and some high-rise buildings.Which will offer superior returns going forward, supply-constrained coastal markets with stagnant or slightly falling populations, or fast-growing Sunbelt markets where supply growth is robust?I would rather own real estate in growing markets. Yes, developers are building lots of new supply in these markets, but that new supply corresponds to the population and job growth. It isn't the result of a speculative bubble. All signs, including , point to the idea that robust population inflows should easily absorb the oncoming supply being delivered. To quote MAA's CEO Eric Bolton from the :On top of the strong positioning of its apartment assets, MAA enjoys one of the strongest, if not  strongest, balance sheets in its apartment REIT peer group. Its credit ratings of A-/A3 make it part of an elite group of REITs with A-ratings.Moreover, 100% of its debt is fixed-rate (no floating-rate exposure) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and weighted average maturity of 7.7 years. Net debt to EBITDA sits at just 3.5x, giving MAA plenty of room to opportunistically use debt-financing for acquisitions in the near future.The combination of well-located apartment assets, a fortress balance sheet, and skilled, conservative management makes MAA a strong long-term performer.In the past, I've called VICI the ""Landlord of Las Vegas,"" because it owns many of the most iconic casino resorts on the Las Vegas strip, such as Caesar's Palace and The Venetian.These are some of the most economically dynamic and profitable properties on the planet. The buildings are built like fortresses, with the tenant-operators contractually obligated to reinvest in them regularly to maintain desirability and functionality.These truly are trophy pieces of real estate and one-of-a-kind buildings, leased to the nation's leading gaming operators under multi-decade, triple-net leases featuring 1.9% average annual rent escalations.Aside from gambling, these operators have multiple streams of revenue, such as hotel rooms, restaurants, bars, convention centers, entertainment venues, retail stores, and even gondola rides (at The Venetian). This makes VICI more than just a casino REIT. It is more of an ""experiential"" REIT.In addition to its irreplaceable Las Vegas properties, VICI also owns high-quality casino real estate in regional gaming hotspots around the US as well as in Alberta, Canada.But VICI is in the process of becoming much more than just the Landlord of Las Vegas. Management exploring other opportunities in one-of-a-kind, experiential real estate to grow the portfolio.For example, VICI recently  to provide financing for the expansion of the luxury wellness resort brand, Canyon Ranch. Part of this agreement included rights for VICI to provide mortgage financing and eventually acquire the real estate of future Canyon Ranch locations.While VICI's 5.9x net debt to EBITDA ratio is higher and BBB- credit rating is lower than the other names in this list......it's important to note that 99% of VICI's debt has fixed interest rates, and only 6.2% of total debt matures prior to 2025. Moreover, VICI aims to reduce its net leverage ratio from 5.9x to the 5-5.5x range, which would put it in line with other blue chip REITs.Finally, if I could only own seven REITs, the last one would be WPC, a triple-net lease REIT specializing in sale-leasebacks of large industrial facilities in North America and retail stores in Europe.WPC targets strong real estate that is highly critical to the operations of its tenants, which are typically just barely sub-investment grade in creditworthiness. This is where WPC sees the best deals.Slightly over half of its portfolio is in industrial/manufacturing or warehouse/distribution properties, with 17% in retail stores and 16% in office. Much of this office exposure is in Europe, where worker utilization of offices is higher than the US.As a perk of performing sale-leasebacks, WPC negotiates landlord-friendly lease terms such as multi-decade terms, relatively high annual rent escalations (usually linked to the local country CPI), and master leases. About 99% of leases by rent feature some sort of contractual rent escalation, and over half (54%) features inflation-based bumps.Strikingly, 37% of WPC's rent roll has  CPI-based escalators. That's a big reason why WPC's same-store rent growth has surged from about 1.5% in 2021 to 4.3% in the last two quarters.This is an incredible level of organic rent growth for a net lease REIT!Although WPC does have ~15% of its total debt maturing in 2024 and another 3% maturing in the balance of this year, the REIT's strong BBB+ credit rating should ensure that its borrowing costs don't surge too much.At a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.7x, WPC's leverage is a bit on the high side, but by no means worrisomely so. This is especially true given its strong organic rent growth.CEO Jason Fox has done a great job of transforming WPC into a pure-play net lease REIT with a simple story, strong cost of capital, and renewed capacity to grow.You'll notice I didn't discuss valuations, dividend yields, or dividend growth track records above. Those are topics for another article, and I've written other articles about almost all of these REITs.The point of this article was to articulate why these seven REITs are best-in-class businesses with phenomenal real estate, strong balance sheets, and enduring competitive advantages.While I fully intend on holding all 18 of the REITs I currently own, if I had to only own seven, or if someone asked me which are the seven highest quality REITs that they can look into, it would be these.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5/5 rating from 400+ reviews:Austin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

"Procter & Gamble trades higher after organic sales, margins impress in FQ1","Procter & Gamble Company () rallied in early trading on Wednesday after smashing expectations with a 7% gain in  organic sales vs. +5.8% consensus. Pricing was up 7% during the quarter and the effect of a favorable mix was +1%, while volume fellThe organic sales gain was led by a 10% jump for the Health Care segment, with prices up 6%. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to increased pricing and favorable product mix. Personal Health Care organic sales increased double digits due to increased pricing and volume growth due to innovation and strong demand for respiratory products.Organic sales jumped 9% in the Fabric and Home Care segment. Fabric Care organic sales increased high single digits due to increased pricing and favorable product mix, partially offset by volume declines primarily in Asia. Home Care organic sales increased low teens due to increased pricing and favorable premium products mix.P&G's gross margin rate was up 460 basis points for the quarter, or 520 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by benefits of 330 basis points from increased pricing, 160 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 150 basis points from gross productivity savings. These were partially offset by 60 basis points of negative product mix and 60 basis points of product reinvestments and other impacts.

AMLP: A Good Inflation Hedge With Lower Volatility Than Most Energy Investments,"If you believe energy prices and inflation will be higher for longer but prefer to avoid the volatility of upstream oil and gas equities, the Alerian MLP ETF () may be an investment vehicle toBut why invest in midstream MLPs? Three reasons:That said, if you purchase the units of PAA, EPD or MPLX directly, you will achieve a better yield because the fees charged by AMLP are rather high. However, besides the diversification benefit, the ETF also provides a ""wrapper"" around the K-1 forms issued by individual MLPs. While receiving a K-1 isn't the end of the world, many investors prefer to avoid the tax complexity.AMLP may be particularly attractive if you think the Fed is approaching the end of its tightening cycle and we are headed into financial repression, i.e., lower, artificially managed interest rates while inflation has not fully receded. Historically, just as other high-yield investments, MLPs have underperformed when interest rates were high. However, this time, perhaps because it is still recovering from the pandemic sell-off, AMLP has held up surprisingly well. If the Fed ""pivots"" in the face of rising fiscal deficits, I would expect AMLP to eventually re-rate higher.Midstream assets ought to do well in an inflationary regime because they are ""hard assets"" and also represent critical infrastructure - there is no substitute. The only threat could be a rapid transition to renewables but that is simply not realistic as pointed out by EPD in a  presentation:Further, as , upstream production is getting more gassy and this puts more pressure on the midstream segment:As the Permian's gas output is growing, it is good to  that Appalachia is already constrained by offtake capacity:This promises for an interesting dynamic. Both U.S. LNG export capacity and upstream gas production are growing, but the midstream capacity that links the two is lagging behind. I think this is good for the owners of the existing infrastructure.In fact, the midstream bull thesis extends beyond energy to petrochemicals as well:The U.S. has excess ethane (which, after getting cracked into ethylene is a basic petchem building block) and managing the oversupply will put further premium on storage and export terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast.While some midstream companies are organized as C-corps (similar to most traded stocks), others are MLPs or publicly traded partnerships. Unlike C-corps, MLPs are passthrough entities from federal income tax perspective, which theoretically results in a lower cost of capital.A good  is MPLX, which is  by Marathon Petroleum Corporation ():MPC is the GP (general partner) in the MLP that is responsible for the commercial decisions. In this case, MPC isn't only the GP, but also owns 65% of the common units - the common unit holders are basically the ""limited partners."" In MPLX's case, only 35% of the common units are owned by investors and traded publicly, but there is no reason why that percentage can't be different. MLPs can also have preferred units.While not all MLPs are linked to a corporation, in the MPC-MPLX setup the MLP gets a lot of revenue from the sponsor, i.e., MPLX provides its infrastructure for MPC's use. This usually happens under long-term agreements with minimum payment obligations to shift risk away from the MLP to the sponsor. The GPs may also frequently have ""incentive distribution rights"" which act similarly to carried interest and increase the GP's returns after certain return hurdles are reached by the common unit holders.As the GP controls the MLP from a commercial perspective, the partnership agreement has certain safeguards to protect the common unit holders. Usually all available cash above some minimal level has to be distributed quarterly. Unlike a REIT, the distribution requirement is not tax-driven. However, similarly to a REIT, an MLP must derive at least 90% of its income from ""qualifying activities"" (operating midstream energy infrastructure is of course a qualifying activity).The MLP structure limits the upside for the common units, but the idea is that there is also protection on the downside - and, mostly, the entire setup is intended to facilitate cash distributions in a tax-advantaged way.MLPs target U.S. retail investors. Unlike stock dividends, some of the MLP distribution is considered a ""return of capital"" and decreases the cost basis of the units. This can have the effect of deferring tax on distributions until the investors sell their units.For other market participants, the MLP structure :MLPs have generally been losing popularity. One culprit is perhaps the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% back in 2017, which diminished the tax advantage. However, even prior to that some industry players such as Kinder Morgan ()  their MLPs. In the KMI example one concern was the increasing incentive distribution right payment that resulted in the MLP paying out more cash to KMI than to the common unit holders; the MLP structure was also said to constrain growth.In any case, besides Kinder Morgan, there are a number of other midstream players organized as C-corps; you don't have to invest in MLPs to gain exposure to the sector.The quality of an ETF is as good as the underlying investments:After PAA, MPLX and EPD, the next largest holdings are Energy Transfer (), Western Midstream Partners () and EnLink Midstream (). These top six holdings make up about 75% of the ETF.Currently Seeking Alpha analysts rate each of these MLPs as a ""buy"":Distributions have been slowly growing since the pandemic:The coverage ratios are good:Cash flow multiples are considerably below their pre-pandemic levels:Individually, AMLP's holdings appear to be reasonably good investments.Distributions fell in Q1 2020 and reached their low point in Q1 2021; since then, they have been steadily increasing. Minor quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are probably associated with special distributions:AMLP is less volatile than an upstream ETF such as the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF () and drawdowns have been more muted:AMLP did experience big drawdowns in 2014 and during the pandemic, though; that still weighs down on the long-term historical returns:The 0.85% fee charged by the ETF isn't low either, but that is probably the price if you really want to avoid the K-1s:It is worth pointing out that a from Global X () with a similar no K-1 benefit charges a lower fee of 0.47%. The two ETFs track closely each other although MLPA has slightly underperformed AMLP:The MLPA yield is also a bit lower. Ultimately, AMLP and MLPA cover similar investments, but the holding percentages are different.I started buying AMLP back in 2020 and my average cost basis is currently about $26. Right now, I would probably wait for some correction before I put new money in although AMLP recently seems to have broken above its post-pandemic ""range"":I rate AMLP a ""hold"" which is exactly what I personally am doing.

Jackson Hole: The Fed Faces The Ghosts Of The 1970s As Stock Market Rollercoaster Continues,"Next week, the Federal Reserve hosts its annual . Each year, roughly 120 central bankers, media members, academics, and business leaders attend to share research and escape the summer heat. Unlike its Since then, stocks have been on a rollercoaster, with the S&P 500 () fluctuating in a range above itsStocks have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last year, though volatility slowed significantly as summer arrived. The 15% selloff in the S&P 500 was soon followed by a rally in hopes of a Fed pivot. The rally soon fizzled when Powell didn't give the market what they were looking for and investors began to sell popular stocks in December for tax loss harvesting. Markets rallied again on pivot hopes, only to be pushed back down after the next Fed meeting in February. Stocks fell sharply during the short-lived spring bank crisis, while the subsequent post-bank-crisis rally seems mostly driven by sentiment and fear of missing out. Some profit-taking followed, and here we are, roughly at the same price as a year ago after 12 months of tug-of-war. However, Jackson Hole may break the stalemate.In Powell's speech last year, he alluded several times to the policy mistakes of the 1970s. Then, the Fed's lack of commitment to fighting inflation contributed in large part to allowing core inflation to rise from roughly . Inflation came in three waves then, and the Fed would raise rates to halfheartedly fight inflation, only to cut them too soon and allow inflation to roar back.Most people reading this know the story of how Arab nations imposed a  on the United States, Canada, and the UK in 1973. More than a few of you reading this likely lived through the gas shortages, 55 mph speed limits, and sky-high inflation. In 1973, oil prices skyrocketed and stock markets crashed. The S&P 500 fell 48% from peak to trough. fared much worse, falling over 73% from peak to trough.Less widely known is how a series of policy mistakes that traded short-term gain for long-term gain set the stage for this. This is one reason that political pundits tend to think , while  it may be harder.Compare this with today:So far, the Fed has steadily raised interest rates until they've reached a positive real yield. Sound  this is what is needed to bring down inflation. Now, they'll have to raise them a bit more and keep them above the rate of inflation in order to avoid a disastrous repeat of the 1970s.  from the last meeting showed that members feared upside risks to inflation, which is why most members support hiking interest rates a bit more, even with some progress on inflation. The market is skeptical,  that the Fed is done hiking and will soon begin to cut. However, the Fed said they're going to hike , so there are plenty of people (including me) who will take them at their word.The key to understanding the Summary of Economic Projections is to read between the lines. By comparing the rate of core inflation the Fed projects and the interest rate it projects, we gain an understanding of how the Fed is likely to respond to rising or falling inflation. Essentially, they're looking for a about 2% real yield on cash. That means if core inflation is 3.5%, then they're going to hike one more time and hold rates at a level of 2% above inflation. This is in sharp contrast to many traders who think that if inflation goes to 3% that the Fed will aggressively start to cut when job growth slows or reverses. That's not what the Fed is saying at all, and the difference might be enough to get traders to seriously reevaluate their bets. Under this framework, rates stay above 5% until inflation is under 3%.Why wouldn't the Fed cut rates much when inflation slows down to 3% or so? Quite simply, that's how they got burned in the 1970s, so they're going to take their time. Modeling  supports this view.I calibrated the model to run using core inflation (ignoring rising oil prices) and added an interest rate smoothing feature to account for rents starting to fall. Still, almost all of the models here are calling for more rate hikes, with most favoring an interest rate above 6%. The Fed's dot-plot represents a compromise between the more hawkish members and dovish members worried about the banking system, but a cash rate of 5.75% followed by a long hold seems like the most likely outcome here. The market isn't quite pricing this, so traders may be caught by surprise that the Fed isn't looking to bail them out. Their surprise may be compounded if stocks fall sharply in the coming months and the Fed hikes again rather than pivoting to cuts.It's crucially important that the Fed doesn't allow another 1970s-style inflation surge. It's equally important for the Fed to not cave to political pressure to print money to let Congress off the hook for out-of-control spending. There is no alternative. By the end of the 1970s, Americans' trust in the government was shattered, living standards had stagnated, and the top political priority for voters was ending inflation. People were fed up. That's why they let Fed chair Paul Volcker drop the hammer on the economy and raise rates to 20%. By taking a hard line now, the Fed can ensure we don't have to end up in that position again after multiple consecutive waves of inflation, as was the case in the 1970s.This entire article really boils down to one question. The Fed is offering a 5.5% risk-free return in cash and short-term bonds. Should you take it, and if so, for how much of your asset allocation? I'm inclined to believe the Fed here. For the past year I've said yes–take the risk-free return and for a decent percentage of your portfolio. The downside is asymmetric at current stock market valuations. We'll find out more about the Fed's intentions at Jackson Hole next week.What do you think? Will the Federal Reserve repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, or have they learned their lesson?

BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,"How does BHP Group Limited (), one of the largest diversified mining companies globally, fit into an energy investment thesis?Despite the exceptional 2021-2022 run-up, energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities - particularly among stocks withThat, in a nutshell, is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too. However, I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out. The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand. Perhaps emerging economies like India (INDA) manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs - or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughs.I personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities. For example, cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels; this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an ""environmentally conscious"" voter base. In either case, for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe, the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even net-zero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this. This naturally points to the mining industry as a ""hedge"" if oil gets phased out faster - and within mining, BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resources.BHP's mining portfolio has shifted over the years, but, after the  to Woodside (), currently the group focuses on the :If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker, it has to consume a lot more of BHP's products, at least in the next few decades, to build out the new infrastructure that would support a low-carbon economy. Mining itself is very energy intensive, so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels, but let's assume that's only a short-term effect and in the long-run net fossil fuel use will still drop.BHP is certainly not the only miner out there, but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand out:BHP's year-to-date return is a negative -7.2%, but let's be clear - the only reason for this year's underperformance are fears over China's economy. Yet, the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors' China sentiment may have bottomed. The markets are also forward looking, so commodity futures and BHP's stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving. As much as China remains the main risk, the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higher.The short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything. The Tesla () in your garage only substitutes one type of non-renewable resource for a different one. Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector, and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply. To the IEA's credit, their , entitled ""Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions"", tried to quantify these exact megatrends.The IEA distinguishes between a ""stated policies"" scenario (STEPS), associated with a slower energy transition, and a ""sustainable development"" scenario (or SDS), which implies even faster decarbonization. The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels, by resource type:Copper demand, of relevance to BHP, is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x, depending on how quickly the energy transition moves! In 2020 the world  23.5 million metric tons (or MT) of copper so this is no small deal.The IEA explains:On the production side, the IEA warns of the forthcoming challenges (my highlights):Beyond the electric grid, solar power capacity will also be a demand driver per the IEA:Maybe not as bullish for silver and silicon but copper is again the common denominator.Wind power, in turn, will drive both copper and steel (iron ore) demand. I recently  the woes of wind giant Ørsted which is exposed to the rising cost of materials. And wind infrastructure requires a lot of material:Going back to the IEA's projections:Metallurgical coal itself isn't a direct input for electrification but indirectly steel production (blast furnace) still requires its use.Finally, nickel, another of BHP's inputs is also a  for the energy transition:In sum, the energy transition guarantees the demand for BHP's outputs. Let's examine next the supply side.During its 30 June 2023 financial year, BHP produced the following quantities:To put these numbers into context:In addition, per BHP:For the June '23 year revenue and EBITDA were weighted towards iron ore:However, this can change quickly with the price of the underlying commodities. Compared to Rio Tinto () and Vale () which are even more heavily weighted towards iron ore, BHP is much better diversified.While copper was only 30% of BHP's revenue, BHP as noted is one of the largest producers globally and has a 57.5% stake in the largest copper mine globally. These assets may prove quite valuable in a few years as  behind what is required for the energy transition. For example, copper producer Hudbay Minerals Inc. () sees demand outpacing supply as early as 2025: The supply concerns are shared by S&P which sees  despite high profits in the industry: The causes, according to S&P, include permitting and financing difficulties among others:Energy transition advocates need to understand these realities. Moreover, just as with oil exploration, capital underinvestment can't be undone quickly; S&P's research emphasizes the long lead times (average of 23 years) that it has taken historically to move from discovery to production:The work on the Quellaveco mine, owned by Anglo American () started in the 1960s! By the way, this is another reason to focus on a mature company like BHP and avoid junior miners who may be years away from attaining production.The costs of incremental supply have also been trending up; the  curve gets quite steep as you approach the 20 MT range:Note that to BHP's advantage, Escondida is one of the lowest cost assets out there.Finally, I wanted to mention a chart from the well-known  which suggests that inventories are also at multi-year lows:G&R bring in the ESG dimension as another limiting factor for the industry:Therein lies one of the ESG paradoxes too; even though de-carbonization is the number one ESG priority, the ESG hurdles sabotage the energy transition by cutting access to the metals and minerals that are needed to make it happen. However, just as in the fossil fuel world, this will hand the advantage to the owners of already developed assets.BHP produces iron ore and metallurgical coal, but the ultimate driver for both is steel. According to the :Steel producer ArcelorMittal () is :In particular, steel inventories are low:Just as with copper, much of the future steel demand will come from the :According to CleanTechnica (citing also an ArcelorMittal study):This assessment is  by Argus:The Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. is also expected to be big  for steel:Nickel is of smaller significance to BHP, but it's worth noting it's also one of the key enablers for the energy transition. The IEA study already discussed here expects 60-70% of nickel demand by 2040 to be driven by ""clean energy.""According to the company:Given even in the midst of the Covid pandemic copper held above $2/lb, BHP's primary assets look well positioned.Copper is in contango, due to near-term demand weakness, but the prices remain quite high historically and are way above BHP's breakeven cost:According to BHP:The main concern over iron ore currently is China:Even today with all the China negativity, iron prices remain above BHP's breakevens:Interestingly, JPMorgan () r based on improved iron ore outlook in 2024:Narrative can drive the price, but the price itself is also a signal and it may suggest the worst for China is over:Iron ore prices have indeed come down a lot from 2021 but technically still look to be a in a multi-year bull market since 2016:While short-term metallurgical coal is facing some headwinds, BHP is optimistic for the medium and long-term:It is the familiar theme - the demand will stay high but regulatory issues are hindering investment. The major uncertainty in the short-term is, of course, China. Ironically, in the long run the energy transition may again drive a preference for the specific grade of coal mined by BHP.Australian coking coal is down from the 2022 peak but is doing pretty well compared to the pre-pandemic years:While Nickel is less important to BHP as a revenue driver, BHP's nickel production is quite important for the energy transition. According to the company:The challenges appear limited to the near-term:Nickel prices are down from the recent highs but still well above the 2016-2020 lows:BHP is relatively undervalued compared to the broader sector, at least focusing on enterprise value multiples:The 5.8x EBITDA multiple is consistent with how the market has valued the company over the recent years:To be clear, I don't necessarily expect the multiple to re-rate higher but rather see the gains coming from higher EBITDA in the future as energy transition demand drives up the prices for BHP's outputs.Conveniently, BHP provides in its filings a sensitivity table that shows how EBITDA would change with changes in the prices of the underlying commodities:Starting off the forward EBITDA estimate of about $27 billion, I show the implications for the stock if copper prices and iron increase back to their recent highs (copper above $5/lb and iron ore about $150/t):The upside can be quite significant and I think BHP has good prospects of trading around $80 (mid-point between the copper and iron ore scenarios) by the end of next year. This is about 40% upside and is more than what Wall Street projects:I am of course expecting that the underlying commodities will trade higher in a year compared to the futures curve.The main near-term risk ahead of copper and iron ore is China:The situation in China is obviously not good and the financial media coverage is as bad as it could be. However, at some point (I think sooner rather than later), the government in China will step up the stimulus measures and the economy will rebound. They simply don't have another choice, especially with the complicating geopolitics.On the flipside, commodities seem to be waiting for the slightest signal from Beijing to rally. As reported by Seeking Alpha a :In my view, it is only a matter of time before we see further accommodative measures and copper and iron ore will react quickly.Long-term the bigger risk is that governments in the West realize that the energy transition project is too expensive and backtrack on their de-carbonization pledges. However, as I am recommending BHP as a ""hedge"" within an energy-oriented portfolio, I am not really concerned about this possibility.Lastly, I want to highlight BHP's governance and dividend policy. Mark Twain infamously defined a mine as ""a hole in the ground with a liar on top"" and it is indeed of utmost importance that management's incentives are aligned to the shareholders. BHP has  corporate institutions to ensure transparency and the company is quite exemplary in terms of its public reporting, including voluntary reports that aren't mandated by regulators. As one of the largest companies in Australia that also maintains listings in the UK, US (through ADRs) and South Africa, BHP is watched by many pairs of eyes. This is likely true of other large mining groups too, so the distinction I really want to make is from junior miners who are more likely to have higher governance risks.BHP also has a robust dividend policy that mandates a minimum of 50% of net profit has to be paid as dividends:Seeking Alpha reports the forward dividend yield as 5.62% which compares well to the peer sector:For BHP's 30 June 2022 year the yield was higher due to the special dividend which distributed the proceeds from the sale of the oil business. However, the regular yield of 5-6% is not bad either. It is consistent with what you can earn on T-Bills so even if BHP's stock doesn't take off, you are at least covering your opportunity cost.While my portfolio emphasizes energy stocks (oil and gas), there is always the possibility that de-carbonization limits oil demand earlier than what energy bulls expect. However, for that to happen, there must be a massive call on the metals and mining sector to supply the resources needed for the energy transition. BHP, as one of the largest diversified miners with low-cost resources, offers a good ""hedge"" for the energy thesis. Moreover, even if you don't buy into the energy thesis, BHP could be a good inflation hedge and also pays a dividend that covers the time value of money.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

9% Return Yield At $90 Oil - Diamondback Is The Only FANG You Need,"Oil is making a comeback - even faster than I expected. Despite weak economic growth, poor consumer health, Chinese growth fears, and a hawkish Fed, WTI crude oil is back above $90.Hence, in recentCanadian Natural is one of my three largest oil holdings. The other two are Pioneer Natural Resources () and Chevron (), which I bought because of merger expectations when oil was still subdued - and because it's a fantastic oil major.One stock that readers keep bringing up is , a stock I have covered a number of times in the past. The only reasonHowever, I am considering buying it with the proceeds from a potential CVX sale at some point in the future. After all, FANG is one of my favorite oil companies.In this article, I won't just update my oil thesis after  the stock in July, but I will also walk you through the updated bull thesis for FANG, which consists of deep inventories, very efficient operations that come with low breakeven prices, a solid balance sheet, and shareholder-friendly distribution plans.I also expect that FANG will continue to do what it does best during bull markets: outperform its peers.So, without further ado, let's dive into yet another upstream giant I love!As usual, I am starting these articles with an update on the oil situation.Right now, a lot of people are scratching their heads. Why is oil so high if the economy is so bad?The answer is because of supply. Not only is U.S. shale production running out of steam, as I discussed in the aforementioned CNQ article (and almost every oil article I've written since 2020), but we're also seeing OPEC production cuts.On top of that, as  reports, oil buyers worldwide are grappling with surging premiums for oil supplies, marking some of the highest prices seen in months or even years.This spike in costs is a ripple effect of dwindling stockpiles at the largest U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma. The ramifications of this situation are working their way through international markets, affecting Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.Furthermore, export demand remains high.If we were in a situation, we would likely see a rapid surge in U.S. oil production. However, that is not happening now.As reported by the , this reluctance to increase production is raising concerns about consumer fuel costs, challenging the fight against inflation, and posing new challenges for President Biden's upcoming 2024 election campaign, which is going to be an uphill battle if the economy continues to develop like this.Biden's unfavorable rating is quite significant despite low unemployment.Going back to the Wall Street Journal article, while some analysts predict oil prices may hit $100 a barrel soon, American frackers are cautious.Unlike previous years when they flooded the market with crude to stabilize prices, this time, they seem to be holding back, potentially keeping oil prices elevated until external factors impact production or demand subsides.In the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, the most active oil field in the United States, the number of drilling rigs for crude has declined by approximately 12% to 314 since the end of April, even as U.S. oil prices increased by around $13 a barrel during the same period.Most shale companies have committed to rewarding investors with share buybacks and dividends rather than rapidly increasing drilling efforts in response to inflation and elevated interest rates.Companies are also protecting reserves, as a lot of companies are running out of Tier 1 reserves. Even the Permian is expected to see peak production in 4Q24.Furthermore:While I do not rule out another oil price decline to the $75 to $80 area if economic growth weakens further, my longer-term thesis remains unchanged.I believe that rebounding economic growth in the future will more than likely lead to a situation of prolonged triple-digit dollar oil prices. I do not believe in $200 to $300 oil, but $100 to $130/$140 is definitely possible.This brings me to Diamondback Energy, which is one of the best places to be when betting on elevated oil prices - or just buying great long-term oil exposure.FANG is an independent oil and natural gas company primarily focused on unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas.As of December 31, 2022, FANG held a substantial acreage position in the Permian Basin, with approximately 615,348 gross acres.The majority of this acreage is located in the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, known for their high concentration of oil and liquids-rich natural gas.Please note that the numbers in the overview below are NET acres.The estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of this date were approximately 2,032,971 MBOE, with a significant portion being proved developed producing reserves.This gives the company at least 12 years' worth of production at current rates, excluding any future discoveries.Furthermore, the company has substantial midstream (pipelines and related) investments. It owns the General Partner of Viper Energy Partners LP () and 56% of the limited partner interest.Having said that, there's a lot more to discuss.In addition to having deep reserves and a well-diversified focus on America's go-to basin, it also has top-tier production.In the second quarter of 2023, Diamondback Energy achieved volume outperformance, with both oil and total production exceeding the high end of their respective guidance ranges.Notably, oil realizations stood at an impressive 97% of WTI pricing. This strong performance was accompanied by a robust hedging program, providing a vital insurance policy to mitigate downside risks and protect the dividend.Looking ahead, the company anticipated a 5% reduction in cash capital expenditures for the third quarter, projecting a range of $650 - $700 million. This reduction is attributed to lower well costs, decreased drilling activity, and a slower completion cadence. For the full-year 2023, the company set a revised cash capex guidance of $2,600 - $2,675 million, reflecting a slight increase at the midpoint.As some of these numbers may be vague, let me give you a few other numbers that are very impressive. FANG's operations are so efficient that it is able to protect its base dividend at $40 WTI! This would protect free cash flow in the high-$30 WTI range, making FANG one of North America's most efficient drillers.The company also has a BBB-rated balance sheet with zero maturities until 2026. It has a net leverage ratio of roughly 1x EBITDA and uses the proceeds of non-core asset sales for further debt reduction.I'm bringing this up because, in combination with low breakevens, the company is in a great spot to accelerate shareholder distributions.Thanks to low debt levels, debt reduction is NOT a capital priority of the company.It has other priorities (as seen in the overview below, which also shows its hedges and breakeven point):Since 2018, the company's special dividends have roughly matched its base dividend. Buybacks were larger than both of these items. 2022 saw much higher special dividends than base dividends. Special dividends even exceeded buybacks, which is something I like, as I prefer special dividends.To give you an idea of how much FANG can distribute, it made the free cash flow sensitivity chart below.Please note that FANG is now trading 7% higher compared to the date when data was collected for this chart. This means that expected returns at current levels are slightly lower. The market cap used for these calculations was measured on July 28.Having said that, at $90 WTI, the company is able to generate $17.78 in FCF per share. This translates to an FCF yield of 11.5% using the CURRENT market cap/stock price.75% of that is 8.6%.In other words, at $90 WTI, investors can expect to get a total distribution yield of 8.6%. Even at $70 WTI, that number is still 6.7%!Furthermore, one of the reasons I'm buying energy on dips is the enhanced free cash flow. If investors were to buy FANG after a 10% decline, the distribution yield at $90 WTI would rise to 10%.When combining everything I've said so far about FANG, we get very fertile ground for outperformance.Over the past three years, FANG has returned close to 470%, including dividends. This has beaten the Energy ETF () and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF ().The company has been performing significantly better than its peers, partly due to the poor performance of shale companies before the pandemic. While I do not anticipate the company maintaining a consistent outperformance of nearly 200 points every three years, I do believe that it will continue to outperform its competitors for many years to come.Valuation-wise, I believe that energy companies are attractively valued.Not only is FANG in a great spot to distribute double-digit dividends and buybacks, but energy, in general, is still undervalued compared to the market.I believe that if the market starts to bet on an economic recovery and prolonged elevated energy prices, we could see a massive flow into energy, including FANG.While it's hard to put a price target on a stock that is highly correlated to a commodity, I expect FANG to deliver strong, double-digit annual returns for as long as we're in this favorable energy market.Hence, I continue to buy energy stocks on weakness. Right now, I'm preparing for a potential oil price decline to $80 if the economy keeps weakening. I have close to 20% energy exposure.FANG has a major position in the Permian Basin, deep reserves, and efficient operations with low breakeven prices. Their BBB-rated balance sheet, low debt levels, and shareholder-friendly distribution plans make them a compelling choice for long-term oil exposure.With the potential for oil prices to remain elevated, FANG offers an enticing combination of dividends, buybacks, and special dividends, presenting investors with the prospect of substantial returns.In a market where energy remains undervalued, FANG's outlook is bright, making it a top pick for those seeking strong returns and high income in the energy sector.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Billionaire Ray Dalio Says '50% Chance Of World War' - How To Invest?,"Billionaire Hedge Fund tycoon Ray Dalio - in a recent LinkedIn  titled ""Another Step Toward International War"" - offered some sobering takeaways from the escalating geopolitical conflicts involving Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine. Dalio underscored that these are notIn this article, we will look further at his reasoning behind this stark assertion, evaluate the potential damage that such a conflict would cause to the global economy, and share how weMr. Dalio's thesis draws on parallels between the current geopolitical climate and the periods preceding the two World Wars in the 20th century. He emphasizes that the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts have transitioned from pre-hot-war conflicts to uncontained hot wars, which will likely be brutal and protracted until one side decisively triumphs over the other. Furthermore, Dalio warns that these conflicts have the potential to spread and escalate, involving more countries and potentially leading to a world war if major powers like the US and China are drawn into direct conflict with each other.He believes that the conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, Ukraine, and Russia are - just like in the periods preceding the past two world wars - symptomatic of larger great power conflicts that will significantly impact countries allied with these nations. He suggests that the US is already indirectly engaged in these conflicts, fighting proxy wars in Europe and the Middle East while also preparing for potential conflict in East Asia. The spreading of these wars will not only be costly but will also risk drawing non-combatant nations into the fray, thereby expanding the scope and scale of the conflicts.In terms of solutions, Dalio's idealistic ""pipe dream"" would be for world leaders to recognize the catastrophic potential of hot wars and collaboratively establish pathways and processes to minimize the chances of such conflicts developing. Apart from that increasingly unlikely solution materializing, however, it appears to be only a matter of time before hot conflict between the world's major military and economic powers breaks out.For stock market investors, the implications of a global war would likely be devastating. The escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the potential for them to spiral into a larger, more widespread war could introduce significant volatility and risk into global markets.While the death and destruction that such a global conflict would cause are reason enough to shudder at the idea that they are growing increasingly likely, the economic fallout would be catastrophic as well given how interconnected the global economy has become. A war pitting China against the United States (and undoubtedly involving Taiwan as well) is anticipated to unleash severe repercussions on the global economy and some  put the damage at a 5% contraction of the $23 trillion US economy, marking the worst decline since the Great Depression. The stock markets in the U.S. and around the world would undoubtedly crash, likely surpassing even the 50% drop in the S&P 500 ()() and Nasdaq () witnessed during the 2007-2009 Great Financial Crisis and recession. If the market capitalization of the S&P 500 were to be halved, it would wipe out around $18 trillion in wealth, which is equivalent to roughly two-thirds of the United States' current GDP. Some  even put a 10% GDP decline as probable in this scenario, which equates to a ~$2.5 trillion hit to annual economic output, triggering mass layoffs and plummeting consumption rates.Of course, a significant casualty in this conflict that would drive much of the global economic chaos in its wake would be the semiconductor industry given that Taiwan is a critical player in global semiconductor production (). A major disruption of Taiwan's semiconductor exports to the world's major economies is estimated to potentially eliminate $1.6 trillion in corporate annual revenue. Moreover, the supply chain restructuring required in response to a potential conflict like this would easily surpass the adjustments witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Apple (), Caterpillar (), GM (), Ford (), Tesla (), and Starbucks (), among others, deriving substantial revenues from China.On the other hand, the economic effects would be even more severe for China and its companies like Alibaba () and Nio () due to disrupted trade which would dramatically reduce its exports, cut off access to advanced Western technology and investment capital, and potentially lead to a crisis level shortage of key commodities such as energy, copper, food, and iron ore, exacerbating internal political instability.Overall, the conflict would likely trigger a global depression owing to the intertwined nature of the US and Chinese economies with the rest of the world's economies. Companies, regardless of their national origin, would suffer from supply chain disruptions, impacting consumer and business investments globally.With such scary scenarios becoming increasingly likely, how are investors supposed to position themselves? It may be prudent for some to take advantage of elevated interest rates and hunker down completely in safe havens like investment grade bonds ()(), treasuries (), land ()(), gold ()(), and perhaps for the bold, even Bitcoin (). Maybe even a small short position ()()() on the S&P 500 might make sense given how overvalued the market is right now according to .However, as an investor who is able to take on a bit more risk in pursuit of higher long-term total returns, yet still wants my portfolio to not suffer a complete wipeout in the event of World War 3 breaking out this decade, I am investing increasingly in the following types of securities:By investing in these assets today, I believe that I am positioning my portfolio to deliver attractive current income and risk-adjusted total returns regardless if World War 3 ends up materializing in the near future or not.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Out-Of-Favor Enbridge Shares Are A Buy (Rating Upgrade)," () shares have finally fallen out of favor of late, along with the entire Canadian midstream cohort. They have steadily sold off throughout theInvestors previously granted ENB a halo due to its quasi-monopoly position in Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin egress via its Mainline system. However, the reality is that the regulated price-setting mechanism eliminates any sustainably high return on capital earned from its dominant market position. In fact, in recent years, ENB’s average return on capital has only slightly exceeded its cost of debt.ENB’s persistentlyENB is the largest midstream operator in North America. Its operations are focused primarily on liquids and until recently the company has focused its expansion on its U.S. Gulf Coast facilities. These investments likely offer more attractive returns on capital than ENB's Canadian investments, so we viewed them as a smart use of capital.More recently, however, new management under Greg Ebel has changed course. On September 5, ENB  its deal to acquire three utility assets from Dominion Energy (). The company's move away from liquid midstream operations initially caught observers by surprise, but the market’s reception turned more positive as analysts digested the deal. Despite the overwhelming support for the deal, however, ENB’s stock continued to fall after the announcement.We like the deal. For one, it provides relatively attractive returns on capital, which ENB will need as it confronts a higher interest rate environment. The market values the acquired assets’ cash flows at a slightly higher multiple than ENB’s historical valuation. The company can therefore deploy large sums of capital at attractive returns relative to its legacy assets, and its investments are likely to be well-received by the market. U.S. utility assets will allow ENB to deploy large sums of capital, which will help it move the needle with regard to long-term EBITDA growth. While the deal has yet to close, we believe the Dominion assets are a net positive addition to ENB’s existing system.Even though sentiment toward Canadian midstream is in the dumps, company fundamentals have been stable—and in some cases have improved—over the past few quarters. ENB offers a case in point.First off, its cash flow has been stable. What the company has sacrificed in terms of its return on capital, it has gained in terms of cash flow stability, as demonstrated by its operating cash flow below.ENB’s cash flows will also remain largely insulated from the impact of inflation. ENB investors can rest assured that operating cash flow will remain supported in nearly any macro oil market or economic scenario.ENB’s stable cash flow can support a large debt level, which has caused debt to grow at a rapid clip. For the most part, EBITDA growth went hand-in-hand with growing debt balances, but by 2021, ENB’s leverage ratio increased significantly above 5-times, verging on an uncomfortably high level.However, ENB’s leverage situation is changing for the better. By far, the most significant recent development for its shareholders over recent quarters has been the company’s inflection from net consumer of cash flow to generating a cash flow surplus. This means it has internally funded its expenses, growth capex, and dividends without the need to raise debt. The following table shows ENB’s cash flows since 2020 and how they’ve improved in 2023.The chart below shows the company’s cash flow deficit inflecting to a surplus in the first and second quarters.If continued, this cash flow inflection should be a game changer for ENB shareholders. Companies like ENB, which generate low returns on capital, cannot continue to spend forever on new growth projects and fund those projects with long-term debt, particularly when the cost of debt is rising as it is today. Instead, they should pare back their growth capex—which in recent years has run at ludicrously high levels for ENB—and use excess cash flow to pay down debt. Without a growing debt balance, new projects set to come online over the coming quarters and years can increase Adjusted EBITDA and lower the leverage ratio to comfortable levels for shareholders.ENB’s cash flow surplus demonstrates management’s commitment to reining in leverage. The chart below shows the recent progress in doing so and illustrates how swiftly leverage metrics can improve for a prodigious generator of cash flow like ENB.Management targets a leverage ratio of 4.5 to 5.0-times, so ENB is back in the clear with regard to leverage. What's clear is that ENB’s current leverage ratio should not have caused its stock’s recent selloff. Given how management plans to finance the Dominion asset acquisition, we don’t expect the deal to significantly add to ENB’s leverage.The other positive development for ENB shareholders has been the new management’s tack toward returning excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. If the company is in fact inflecting to a sustainable cash flow surplus, shareholders will want to be sure that uninvested excess cash is delivered back to them in an intelligent manner. At the moment, with ENB shares being valued at multi-year lows amid stable or improving fundamentals, share repurchases offer a particularly attractive alternative.In the first half of 2023, ENB spent its excess cash on asset acquisitions, but the Dominion utility acquisition will likely be the last one for some time. ENB also spent on share repurchases, which is more constructive for shareholders. At the very least, it shows the new management’s intent to allocate capital intelligently for shareholders.We also expect ENB’s excess cash flow to be delivered to shareholders through increased dividends, continuing ENB’s impressive long-term track record, as shown below.Our ENB valuation implies little downside risk and significant total return upside from the current price of $44.50. With regard to appreciation potential, the shares possess 21.3% upside to our price target of $54.00.Our EV/EBITDA valuation implies that the shares offer 11.6% total return upside through next year, which increases to 56.9% by 2027.Dividends comprise a large portion of the total return, and we believe ENB’s safe and large 8.1% yield is particularly attractive.Our valuation doesn’t account for the Dominion asset acquisition. We expect the transaction to add to ENB’s intrinsic value over time. As such, we believe our valuation excluding the assets is more conservative.Our valuation is also conservative due to its 10.5-times EV/EBITDA multiple. ENB has traded at a multiple closer to 11.5 in recent years, so a reversion to a higher trading multiple would result in additional upside for the shares.It’s taken a while for us to come around to Enbridge Inc. shares, but the recent selloff has done the trick. We recommend the shares for conservative investors, as the large dividend yield should be safe and substantially shielded from the impact of inflation. Income investors should make the contrarian move and buy out-of-favor ENB shares for the long term.At HFIR Energy Income, we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation.

Ranger Energy: 2 Solid Reasons To Consider This Under-The-Radar Oil Stock,"The oilfield services sector is a tough space for many companies. Even with oil hovering near the $90s, the drilling activity in the US continues to decline. In spite of the weakness in the oilfield services sector, there are still some hiddenRanger Energy Services, a small-cap oilfield services company with a valuation of $340 million, offers high specification rigs, wireline services, processing solutions, and additional services to US oil and gas producers. Like its peers in the oilfield services sector, Ranger Energy faces a testing market environment, characterized by a persistent decrease in rig count numbers.The US rig count is a pivotal indicator of drilling activities. It has experienced a notable drop this year. Indeed, oil producers have pulled rigs from every shale oil region. The most recent data from Baker Hughes ()  622 rigs were operational in the US at the end of the previous week. This is a stark contrast to the 769 rigs from the same timeframe the preceding year. Notably, almost half of these rigs are active in the Permian Basin. This basin, spanning West Texas and New Mexico, stands out as the US's most productive shale oil area. Within the Permian Basin, the count of oil and gas rigs recently plummeted to its lowest level in over 17 months to 309 units by the end of the first week of October, and has since improved slightly to 311 units. I believe the depth of the slump in oil and gas drilling activities is evident when considering the consistent quarterly decline in the rig count this year.Oil prices remain notably elevated, with both WTI and Brent hovering around $88 a barrel at the moment and averaging above $75 throughout the current year. The oil and gas producers are reaping substantial profits and robust free cash flows (FCF). Nonetheless, in contrast to the previous year, when prices steadfastly exceeded $100 for a prolonged duration and averaged over $93, the current prices appear somewhat subdued. This can partly account for the decline in drilling activity.Another significant factor is that oil producers are emphasizing enhanced shareholder returns, through dividends and buybacks. In my view, they are showcasing capital discipline, refraining from aggressively ramping up production by adding more rigs. Such a move could necessitate elevated capital outlays, potentially impinging on the shareholders' cash returns. This poses challenges for Ranger Energy Services and its fellow oilfield service providers.The future landscape still seems shrouded in ambiguity. Just a few weeks back, the sentiment inclined towards crude possibly touching $100 a barrel, but it has since retracted to the high-$80s. I believe the recent upheavals in the Middle East, following Hamas's attack on Israel, brings further unpredictability onto the oil's prospects. OPEC+, steered by powerhouses Saudi Arabia and Russia, has been constraining output to support oil prices. Indications of a tightening oil market are evident, as  weak inventory levels. With escalating geopolitical tensions, there's speculation that the US could intensify sanctions on Iran, curbing its oil exports. By one , this could remove around 500,000 bpd of Iranian oil, intensifying the market's tightness and potentially driving prices upwards.Conversely, it remains to be seen how long OPEC+ plans to restrict supplies, or if global economic  and potential US interest rate hikes will dent oil demand. Suppose, hypothetically, Saudi Arabia and Russia escalate their exports in a bid for a larger market slice, or if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates to temper inflation, leading to an accumulation in oil stockpiles, then this could exert downward pressure on oil prices. I expect prices to continue to bounce between these demand and supply concerns in the near future.In this unpredictable oil price landscape, I believe US oil producers may remain cautious. They could maintain subdued drilling activity, just enough to uphold or modestly increase output, all while achieving robust profits and FCF to support dividends and buybacks.I think this challenging situation is further underscored by Ranger Energy's seemingly dimmed outlook, as reflected in their adjusted earnings forecast. Initially, the company anticipated revenues ranging from $685 million to $710 million for 2023. Now, they project to earn between $660 million and $680 million. Note that the new forecast's upper limit is even below the initial projection's lower limit. While they first projected an adjusted EBITDA of $95 - $110 million, their current expectation stands at $92 - $97 million. And though Ranger Energy has tightened its FCF projection from $55 - $70 million to a range of $55 - $65 million, this indicates a 4% decline at the midpoint.However, is Ranger Energy equipped to navigate this market effectively? The short answer is, yes. In fact, I think the company is even more prepared now than it was before, and this can be attributed to two key reasons., Ranger Energy showcased margin improvement in its most  (Q2-2023). A significant aspect of Ranger Energy's operation is its niche focus on completion and production services. A considerable portion of its revenue ties directly to oil companies' operational costs, as they spend money to maintain, enhance, or mend their oil and production wells. This is distinct from the funds dedicated to drilling fresh wells or engaging in exploratory efforts, which demands capital outlays. As a result, even with the challenges stemming from the slowdown in drilling and fracking activities — as the guidance revision indicates — I believe Ranger Energy is well-positioned to sustain a healthy demand.In the company's second-quarter results, improvements in pricing across all three segments : High-Specification Rigs, Wireline Services, and Processing Solutions & Ancillary Services. The High-Specification Rigs and Wireline Services segments notably felt this positive shift.Within the High-Specification Rigs domain — typically accounting for over half of Ranger Energy's revenue — there was a reported 9% year-over-year uptick in revenues per rig hour, reaching $682. This occurred despite a 6,700-hour decline in total rig operations. The advantageous effect of this pricing strategy allowed Ranger Energy to grow its adjusted EBITDA by 10%, reaching $15.6 million, even when faced with a modest 2% revenue growth of $77.6 million. In a similar vein, the Wireline Services, which stands as the company's second-largest segment, saw revenues climb by 10%. However, the adjusted EBITDA skyrocketed by 33%. This significant growth in earnings encapsulates the advantageous repercussions of the improved pricing model.What stands out to me is the consistent trend of these pricing improvements. For instance, in , the company marked positive pricing shifts in both the High-Specification Rigs and Wireline Services domains. In these segments, the Q1-2023 adjusted EBITDA growth also outstripped revenue growth. I believe this consistent ability to raise prices indicates more than just a sporadic success; it suggests a steady strategy that augurs well for Ranger Energy's future earnings trajectory. Even amidst market challenges, the company saw decent demand, managed to elevate prices, and broadened its margins., I believe Ranger Energy has done a commendable job of achieving the zero net debt target, predominantly due to its capability to generate not just profit, but also substantial FCFs. For Q2, the company revealed net profit of $6.1 million and FCF of $16.1 million. For over a year, the company has consistently showcased strong quarterly FCFs. The surplus cash (over and above the capital expenditures) has been judiciously employed to bolster cash reserves and whittle down debt. Over the past year, the company slashed over $56 million of its debt, ending Q2 with a nominal debt of just $300,000. Concurrently, cash reserves grew from $5.1 million a year ago to $6.4 million by Q2-2023's close, which translates into a negative net debt (debt minus cash).With a pristine balance sheet, Ranger Energy stands fortified against potential market adversities. Despite witnessing a positive trajectory in pricing, should there be unfavourable downturns impacting prices, Ranger Energy's robust balance sheet ensures it is better equipped to weather such storms compared to many competitors.But pivoting away from dire hypotheticals, with the attainment of the zero-net-debt milestone, I anticipate a renewed Ranger Energy emphasis on lifting shareholder returns. The absence of debt implies that the surplus cash can now be channelled to gratify shareholders via dividends, buybacks, and strategic, value-adding acquisitions that can propel the company’s profits and stimulate revenue growth.In fact, this trend is already in motion, which is a positive sign. Ranger Energy has committed to return ""a minimum of 25% of yearly cash flows"" back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During Q2, the firm repurchased nearly 2% of its outstanding shares and initiated its quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share, translating into dividend yield of 1.46%, almost mirroring the S&P 500's average yield of 1.56%.Additionally, a judicious acquisition gesture by Ranger Energy underscores the management's readiness to leverage the firm's financial muscle to augment growth. In Q2, they allocated $7.25 million for the purchase of 15 pumps and associated equipment to bolster its wireline segment. These assets, earmarked for the lucrative Permian Basin and other high-demand zones, will fortify their high-margin pump-down operations, projecting a positive ripple effect on the firm's revenue and earnings in forthcoming quarters.Oilfield service providers may grapple with subdued demand, yet I believe Ranger Energy stands resilient in this landscape. The company is showing initial signs of regaining pricing power. The consistent uptick in its pricing suggests an imminent positive influence on its earnings and profit margins. Moreover, with its fortified balance sheet, Ranger Energy appears well-equipped to navigate potential market turbulence. Besides, its pivot towards enhancing shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks signals promising returns for investors.The company's shares have already clocked an impressive 25% rally this year. And when it comes to valuation? I believe there's still room for growth. Currently, Ranger Energy stock is trading at 9.3x their forward earnings estimate. This sits notably lower than the sector's median of 10.65x, according to . Contrast this with industry juggernauts like Schlumberger (), Halliburton (), Baker Hughes, and NOV (), which hover between 14x and 23x forward earnings estimates. Based on these metrics, I maintain my endorsement of Ranger Energy stock as a 'buy' and project its continued industry outperformance.However, a word of caution is essential. Ranger Energy remains an oil-centric stock. This ties its fortunes to oil price dynamics. A slump in oil prices, perhaps triggered by dampened demand due to low economic growth, can exert downward pressure on its share price. Moreover, a greater-than-anticipated decline in rig count, especially if prolonged, can negatively dent the stock's performance. Potential investors should duly weigh these risks before deepening their commitment to this stock.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

On October 5, nearby November futures at the $83 level turned bearish. December Brent futures were at the $84.40 per barrel level in early October after correcting from above $97.50 in late September. Expect volatility to continue. Crude oil declined as U.S. interest rates soared. The 30-year Treasury bond futures fell to the lowest level since 2007 in early October.In the U.S., there is some debate about the reasons for rising crude oil prices. Some believe the administration's approach to addressing climate change by supporting alternative and renewable fuels and inhibiting oil, gas, and coal production and consumption is necessary because of the environmental threat. Others feel the administration handed oil pricing power to the international oil cartel and Russia by limiting the potential of U.S. fossil fuel production.Saudi Arabia and Russia are the OPEC leaders. Even though Russia does not officially belong to the cartel, Moscow has cooperated with production quotas since 2016, and policy is a function of negotiations between Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Moscow.Saudi Arabia needs at least an $80 per barrel price to balance its domestic budget. Higher levels only improve the Saudi economy. Russia depends on petroleum revenues to finance its war effort in Ukraine. Moreover, Russia has used crude oil as an economic weapon against countries supporting Ukraine.The geopolitical landscape and U.S. energy policy created a bullish cocktail for the oil market. The Biden administration's energy policy path will be a subject of debate during the 2024 election. Consumers are feeling the pinch with gasoline prices rising above $7 per gallon in California and at high levels across the U.S. over the past weeks. As the electorate often votes with its pocketbooks, high gasoline, and fuel prices that have kept inflation elevated will be one of the leading topics for the election.In 2020, the global pandemic caused nearby NYMEX crude oil prices to briefly fall below zero, leading to industry consolidation and cost-cutting. The explosive move that took the NYMEX futures to $130.50 in March 2022 and Brent futures higher caused the surviving oil companies to reap substantial financial benefits. Shares of the leading U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil () and Chevron (), exploded since the 2020 lows.The chart highlights XOM's Over 300% rise from $30.11 in March 2020 to $120.70 per share in September 2023.

At the $164 level on October 5, CVX shares are closer to the late 2022 high.XOM and CVX shares did not peak when crude oil soared to the highest price in fourteen years in March 2022.

The highly liquid ETF trades an average of 638,683 shares daily and charges a minimal 0.10% management fee. The $4.22 annual dividend translates to an above-market 3.52% yield. The average yield of the S&P 500 (), the most diversified U.S. stock market index, is 1.54%.The trend in any market is always your best friend, and it is bending lower in crude oil, related shares, and the VDE ETF in early October 2023. Even the most aggressive bull markets rarely move in straight lines. Traditional energy has been highly profitable over the past years, and fundamental indicators suggest the bullish trend will continue. However, the higher prices rose, the greater the odds of a significant correction. NYMEX crude oil dropped 51.2% from the March 2022 $130.50 high to the May 2023 $63.64 low. At the $83 level on October 5, the energy commodity remains well below the midpoint of the trading range.I remain bullish on the prospects for VDE, but I am protecting long positions with trailing stops and will reestablish them at lower levels. Remember, a trade or investment is never long or short at the original execution price but at the current market. Successful traders and investors constantly reassess risk dynamics at the current price. Since the risk is always a function of potential rewards, increasing stop levels and profit targets on long positions is logical as an asset's price rises.Ride the bullish wave in VDE while realizing the higher the ETF rises, the greater the risk of a sudden and violent correction as we have seen over the past sessions.

That's a path forward to more efficiently produce oil that's in great demand at present and in the foreseeable future.Increasingly, more nuanced approaches and investment opportunities are emerging to play in the energy space. The bottom line: The case for oil and gas, plus green energy plays that are embedded in bellwether stocks or firms makes sense.

Nvidia: Maximize The China AI Chip Ban," () has wildly fallen out of favor as some of the artificial intelligence (""AI"") hype wanes. In addition, the U.S. government continues to press for chip companies to not sell advanced AI chips to China causing potential sales disruptions. My The U.S. government  curbing the sales of AI chips to China. The new restrictions from the U.S. Commerce Department directly target the A800 and H800 chips modified specifically for the Chinese market to comply with prior export controls.The updated restrictions apparently allow for advanced commercial chips, but the U.S. government moves up restrictions to 40 countries where China could use the government as anNvidia claims the new China AI chip restrictions have a limited impact on near-term results. The major implication is that China demand was all pulled forward to front-run these feared additional restrictions.KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts  of the financial impact to Nvidia:The AI chip company is very clear in suggesting the updated AI chip export rules will not have a near-term impact. The suggestion is that the ban will have a long-term impact with Nvidia ultimately struggling to backfill China demand, which represents up to 25% of revenues.The company recently guided to FQ3 revenues of  after reporting $13.5 billion for FQ2'24. Nvidia only produced FQ1 revenues of $7.2 billion and the consensus target for FQ2 was just $11.1 billion.The current quarter ends in 10 days, so Nvidia clearly wouldn't face much financial impact on the October quarter now. Due to the chip company likely pulling forward China demand and possibly shipping through Saudi Arabia, the company could easily have pushed back extra demand from countries not facing restrictions.Analysts forecast revenues surging another 46% to reach $78.8 billion in FY25. Based on this chart, analysts are forecasting massive sales growth with FY27 reaching $112.2 billion, which is ~350% growth in those years.Nvidia has fallen down to $414 while financial projections have soared. The stock actually trades at a very reasonable 25.6x FY25 EPS targets.The market definitely needs to question how Nvidia still hits the FY25 EPS target of $16.48. The AI chip company requires over 50% earnings growth next year to reach this amount. Technically, the number would appear near impossible based on the China AI chip ban, but the chip company likely has a plan on circumventing the export ban.The stock actually trades below the forward P/E multiple back in early 2023 prior to the big revenue and EPS guide-up. Nvidia traded at nearly 40x forward EPS estimates when the stock was trading at $225 and analysts only forecast FY25 EPS estimates of ~$5.50.Due to the fears over China AI chip bans and the precarious position of the stock chart, investors should look for Nvidia to close the gap to nearly $300 prior to the big guide-up in revenues that occurred at the end of May. Considering the stock faces a bearish H&S pattern, the market negativity, and the precarious position of the AI chip ban, Nvidia is likely to close the massive gap on the chart.Ultimately, Nvidia is likely to resolve the China AI chip issue and eventually collect those massive data center revenue opportunities. Such a possible solution could be China working out a data center usage plan with an external ally able to import the AI chips with China allowed to access cloud computing services.The stock definitely trades as if the financial targets highlighted above will be impossible to hit with China export curbs in place. Nvidia wouldn't trade at half the current growth rates and prior P/E multiple if investors were confident in the consensus targets, though the numbers haven't been adjusted down this last weekSeveral analysts cut price targets recently, such as Citi cutting the price target $55 to a still-high $575. Regardless, the consensus analyst targets are up at $643 providing over 55% upside to Nvidia now.The stock could definitely hold at the current price and rally. Investors need to be prepared for either outcome, but the ideal time to buy shares for maximum return and reduced risk is to wait for a gap close to $300 on maximum fear.The key investor takeaway is that Nvidia still appears full-speed ahead with insatiable AI chip demand. Nvidia Corporation stock has hit a wall due to China AI chip curbs, but investors should use weakness as an opportunity, with China and Nvidia likely finding a solution before sales are materially hurt. The stock is actually cheaper now and further weakness could turn Nvidia into a value stock.Stone Fox Capital (aka Mark Holder) is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

Buy Gold In October 2023: The Planets Are Aligning For Its Resurgence,"ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista  yesterday that:In this article, we are going to look at the various factors that are aligning to lead to what we believe will be a resurgence for gold ()()() in the coming months and years.The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has sent shockwaves through global markets, with investors rushing to shield their portfolios from the ensuing uncertainty that the conflict may spread throughout the region and ultimately even lead to a conflict that embroils two major oil exporters in Iran and Saudi Arabia. Gold, with its historical precedent of being a safe-haven asset, has witnessed a significant jumpMoreover, the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe between Russia and Ukraine and its Western Allies as well as the growing tensions in East Asia between North Korea and South Korea and between China and Taiwan - with the potential for catastrophic wars to erupt from any of those hot spots - provide additional incentive to own gold during these geopolitically volatile times.Gold has traditionally been an  against inflation. With the global economy experiencing significant volatility and uncertainty at the moment and various nations still trying to balance fighting off inflationary pressures with trying to avoid falling into recession, gold looks like an increasingly prudent investment.Despite the gold price initially falling more than 11% from its May high due to the Fed's hawkish outlook, the precious metal still holds potential for price appreciation in the coming years...And it has already begun to make a comeback in recent days:Moreover, it seems probable that the U.S. Government will continue its runaway deficit spending for the foreseeable future. Consequently, this will exert significant pressure on the Federal Reserve to eventually reduce interest rates, potentially resulting in negative real interest rates in the long run. As a result, inflation rates are expected to surpass nominal interest rates, creating a highly favorable scenario for gold over the long term.Another reason to be bullish on gold right now is that historically, gold has demonstrated a pattern of delivering positive average returns of 0.71% and 1.3% in November and December, respectively, due in part to a rise in jewelry demand and a generally weaker dollar in December. As a result, if history is any guide, buying gold in October could be a great risk-adjusted move.The recent surge in central bank purchases of gold underscores the precious metal's enduring appeal amidst global economic and geopolitical tumult. Central banks, both from advanced economies and emerging market/developing economies (EMDE), are amassing gold reserves at a pace not seen for over 50 years, with these entities accounting for 34% of total gold demand in the third quarter of 2022 and their rapid pace of buying continuing into 2023.This buying spree was likely prompted at least in part by the geopolitical upheaval caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant sanctions on Russia, prompting a re-evaluation of U.S. dollar reserves' vulnerability. This is evidenced by the fact that 42% of banks anticipate a decline in U.S. dollar holdings, according to a World Gold Council . Furthermore, nations like Russia and China have been aggressively purchasing gold, potentially as a safeguard against foreign asset seizures. EMDE banks, often more proactive in their gold-buying endeavors than their Western counterparts, clearly increasingly view gold not merely as a historical store of wealth, but as a strategic asset that provides a buffer against potential payment crises arising from current or future sanctions and insulating their often more fragile economies against global financial crises.If this strong central bank demand continues - which it is showing no signs of slowing down - it will likely provide a pretty strong tailwind for gold prices over the long term.Thanks to its multi-millennia history of being a safe-haven asset, gold is once again catching a bid due to rising global geopolitical unrest, driven by conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and East Asia.Furthermore, gold serves as a hedge against inflation, especially as the global economy faces uncertainty and inflationary pressures. Despite a recent drop in gold prices due to the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance, it is expected to appreciate in the coming years, given the likelihood of continued deficit spending and potential negative real interest rates for years to come.Historical trends also favor gold, with positive returns in November and December due to increased jewelry demand and a weaker dollar during that period. Last but not least, central bank purchases of gold have surged, driven by concerns over geopolitical upheaval and sanctions on Russia. This trend is particularly notable in emerging markets and developing economies, where gold is seen as a strategic asset to protect against payment crises and global financial instability. This strong central bank demand is expected to support gold prices in the long term.There are many great ways to invest in the yellow metal, including holding physical bullion in a secure location, investing in ETFs like GLD, IAU, or PHYS, or even buying gold miners and streaming/royalty companies through ETFs like  or directly via leading global miners and streamers like Barrick Gold (), Newmont Corporation (), or Wheaton Precious Metals (). Personally, I think that an all-of-the-above approach makes a lot of sense because each form of investment has its pros and cons and helps to insure against a host of potential outcomes, which is the main purpose of investing in gold in the first place.

OPEC Upate October 2023 And EIA International Energy Outlook 2023,"The  (MOMR) for October 2023 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is September 2023 and output reported for OPEC nationsThe IEO reference scenario has a sharp drop in OPEC output of 5.5 Mb/d from 2024 to 2026, an alternative scenario (OPEC-DC est) is presented which will be discussed after the OPEC part of the post.OPEC crude output was revised higher in August 2023 by 33 kb/d compared to last month’s report and July 2023 OPEC crude output was revised higher by 22 kb/d. When the World was at its CTMA peak for C+C output in 2018, OPEC crude output was about 31300 kb/d and by September 2023 OPEC crude output had fallen to roughly 3545 kb/d below the CTMA peak in 2018.Preliminary data indicates that global liquids production in September was 0.1 Mb/d less than last month and averaged 100.6 Mb/d. World liquids output increased about 2.9 Mb/d in the past 23 months (from 97.7 Mb/d in October 2021).Preliminary August 2023 data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks down m-o-m by 11 Mb. At 2803 Mb, they were 82 Mb higher than the same time one year ago, but 117 Mb lower than the latest five-year average and 182 Mb below the 2015–2019 average. As World Oil stocks continue to fall the risk of an oil price spike will increase.There was a significant draw on World oil stocks in 2023Q3 of about 133 Mb, if OPEC estimates of World Supply and Demand for Oil are correct. A continuation of OPEC cuts in 2023Q4 could lead to another 300 Mb of stock draw if OPEC estimates for oil supply and demand are correct in 2023Q4.Now a quick discussion of the EIA’s IEO 2023. The IEO reference scenario for World C+C output has a sharp drop in crude output from 2024 to 2026 of about 3.3 Mb/d, but this is not reflected in their estimates for demand for the main liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and residual fuel). From 2021 to 2022 the ratio of these 4 liquid fuels in barrels of oil equivalent to C+C produced was about 89%, but the ratio jumps sharply from 2024 to 2026 as shown in the chart below to over 93%.My alternative scenario (DC scen) for World C+C assumes the ratio of liquid transport fuel to C+C production rises gradually from 89% in 2022 to 91% in 2031 and then remains at that level until 2035 and assumes the quantity of liquids fuel demand is unchanged. My expectation is that after 2030 the demand for transportation fuel is likely to be lower than the EIA reference scenario, but I did not add that assumption to the DC scenario presented below. The OPEC-DC est presented in the second chart of the post simply subtracts the EIA’s IEO reference scenario for non-OPEC C+C output from the World C+C- DC scen presented in the chart below. I also expect that non-OPEC output may be slightly lower than the EIA has published in the IEO 2023 reference scenario and that OPEC C+C output will likely need to be about 30to 31 Mb/d from 2025 to 2030 in order for World C+C to match the DC scenario in the chart below.

Occidental Petroleum Continues To Evolve,"August 15th proved to be an interesting day for shareholders of  (). This massive, diversified energy firm that has now long been favored by Warren Buffett might be thought of as just another traditional playerRecognizing that it's imperative to focus on the long haul, management has been, for years now, investing in preparing the enterprise for a cleaner future. The latest evidence of this came on August 15th, when management  the purchase of a technology innovator in the carbon capture space. Although it will take years before investments like this start to become meaningful to the company, the long-term growth prospects from said investments will be remarkable. And thatIn a press release issued on August 15th, the management team at Occidental Petroleum stated that they entered into an  all of the stock of a Canadian firm called Carbon Engineering Ltd. The all-cash deal is valued at approximately $1.1 billion. Interestingly, the transaction will not be made all at once. Instead, it will be made in three roughly equivalent payments over a three-year window of time, with the first of these, totaling about $367 million, occurring at closing some time before the end of this year. Of course, that timeline could change some, since the entity that Occidental Petroleum is purchasing is a Canadian enterprise and is subject to Canadian regulatory oversight on top of any oversight that must be handled here at home.Most people, myself included, have never heard of Carbon Engineering Ltd before this. But if you are at all interested in the alternative energy space, you likely have heard of what the company focuses on. Since 2019, Occidental Petroleum has been working with Carbon Engineering Ltd When it comes to what is referred to as DAC, or direct air capture, technology. For those who don't know, DAC is a process that utilizes large fans in order to suck air into a system that runs that air through multiple filters.The goal from this process is to extract the carbon from the air, after which the air will be released back into the wild. The carbon, meanwhile, will often be converted into a liquid and pumped back into the Earth, or it can be used as a feedstock for other purposes. It is important to note that there's a difference between DAC and CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage). While CCUS focuses on capturing emissions that are currently being ejected into the atmosphere from energy production and other facilities, DAC focuses on removing emissions from the atmosphere, irrespective of where those emissions came from or when they were ejected. Today, Occidental Petroleum is focusing on both paths.Unfortunately, we don't know much about the company besides this. We do know, however, that management believes this will open multiple revenue opportunities for the company in the years to come. In addition to aiding in the further development of Stratos, the largest DAC plant in the world, the technology will also open up the opportunity for the company to generate revenue from technology licensing and royalties.This is not the company's first foray into this kind of work. In fact, the company has an entire portion of its business dedicated to preparing for a low carbon future. On top of making investments in third-party entities that are currently developing technology, such as NET Power, the company also focuses on the development and commercialization of its own DAC technologies. For instance, as of the end of the 2022 fiscal year, the company had successfully achieved zero routine flaring of gas across both its oil and natural gas operations in the US. They did this eight years ahead of the 2030 target set by the World Bank. They also managed to reduce emissions of methane by 33% compared to what they were in 2020. And they also, in 2022, invested $530 million into low carbon businesses, technologies, and other related opportunities. The plan for 2023 had originally been to invest up to $500 million into various projects. With this purchase, the firm has handily surpassed that.In a special  that the company provided back in March of 2022, it talked in great detail about its carbon-oriented initiatives. Using one of its subsidiaries, known as 1PointFive, Occidental Petroleum is making some massive moves in this market. But this isn't solely out of a sense of goodwill. Rather, it's the financial reason that's driving the business. In 2020, it was estimated that the market opportunity for companies voluntarily aiming to reduce their emissions to zero or close to it have the potential to generate around $5 billion a year in revenue from various low carbon initiatives. That number is expected to balloon to $50 billion by 2030.While this on its own is appealing, it will be the regulatory side of things that really pushes this market higher. At one point, competitor  ()  that by the year 2050, carbon capture initiatives could be worth $4 trillion per year. Similarly, Occidental Petroleum pegged the  at between $3 trillion and $5 trillion by 2050.Obviously, the ultimate market size will be determined in large part by how much investment is made into this space. At present, Occidental Petroleum believes that there will only be about 70 DAC plants in operation by 2035. That will only achieve about 1.5% of the 5,000 MTPA addressable market opportunity that the firm believes exists. To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the industry would need to have 135 plants in operation by 2035.Of course, this does not come easy. And it's definitely not cheap. Currently under development, for instance, is the aforementioned Stratos project, which will be the first large scale DAC facility in the world when it begins commercial operations in mid-2025. However, the first phase of the project is expected to launch sometime next year and will be capable of capturing around 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The project in its entirety is forecasted to cost the company around $1 billion, if not more. This particular facility will be opened in the Permian basin. However, on August 11th of this year, Occidental Petroleum  that it received a grant from the US Department of Energy's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations for the development of a DAC hub in South Texas.This particular facility, once launched, can  up to 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per annum and the 106,000 acres of pore space that the company has access to will accommodate up to 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in saline formations. If the company takes full advantage of the space that is available to it, it could eventually scale this facility up to the point of removing and storing up to 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Details have not been provided regarding exactly how large this grant is. However, it is one of two projects that the U.S. government is  up to $1.2 billion in total to. And that is only the start, since the federal government has set aside $25 billion of funding for the purpose of delivering clean energy demonstration projects that are at the scale needed to be truly viable.It's unclear at this point in time what kind of financial impact the low carbon initiatives being tackled by Occidental Petroleum will have on the company. But in the long run, this kind of business could help Occidental Petroleum Corporation transition from what it has been in the past to something entirely new and, potentially, even larger and more profitable, in the future. This is not something that will pay off in the next couple of years in any large way. But for those focused on the long haul, this will likely be a big piece of the company's future.

ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,"Energy MLP stocks were a bright spot in a challenging third quarter for equity markets, with the Alerian MLP Index returning 9.89% as the S&P 500 Index (, ) declined 3.27%. Supply cuts from OPEC+ combined with lower U.S. inventories pushed oil prices higher, fueling further inflation and interest rate concerns — a headwind for broad equities, but a positive for energy stocks.The dynamics affecting the MLP market remain unchanged. Global economies continue to face multiple headwinds, led by a combination of stubbornly high (though recently moderating) inflation, elevated geopolitical uncertainty and lingering supply chain and policy impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S., we have begun to see the dampening effects on the economy of tighter monetary conditions. During 2022, equity markets began pricing in a reasonable chance of recession, both in the U.S. and abroad. Thus far in 2023, global equity markets have recovered most of the losses incurred during 2022 and expectations are increasing that developed economies might avert a severe recession.Crude oil prices fell from more than $120 per barrel in June 2022 to ~$70 per barrel to end June 2023. Recession fears left oil market traders fearful of global demand downdrafts for crude oil in 2023 much like those witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis (GC). A stronger U.S. dollar and large-scale releases of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) further pressured oil prices. On the other hand, demand fear was partially offset by some optimism for a rebound in China consumption with the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. The surprise OPEC+ supply cut of 1.1 million barrels per day at the end of March also likely puts a floor on oil prices over the near term. With better visibility on global demand impacts from rising interest rates, oil prices steadied and rose in July, August and September.Essentially all of this oil demand growth is expected in developing nations, rather than OECD nations. We would argue that oil prices of roughly $70 per barrel at the end of June discounted that oil demand growth will not approach levels expected by oil economists in 2023 and 2024. Said differently, oil traders seem to expect a material contraction in global oil demand growth rates compared to oil economists. A final twist to oil demand analysis remains the timing of the U.S. refilling its vastly depleted SPR. After drawing down the SPR by roughly 275 million barrels (or ~45%) in the previous 18 months, the U.S. government announced in June initial plans to begin refilling the SPR beginning in September. Thus, what has been a meaningful source of supply in the crude oil markets will become a source of demand looking forward.If global oil demand growth does approach roughly 2 million barrels per day in 2023 and another 1.0-1.5 million barrels per day in 2024, we see upside in oil prices over the balance of 2023 and into 2024. The supply side of the global oil market will meaningfully struggle to meet that kind of demand growth. We would also argue that the incremental barrel of oil supply in such a scenario will almost have to be a barrel of U.S. oil — continuing to drive visibility in U.S. oil production growth to the benefit of U.S. midstream companies.Looking at natural gas, the short-term outlook is decidedly negative while the intermediate- to long-term outlook remains robust. An almost complete lack of typical weather last winter left natural gas storage levels 32% higher at the end of March 2023 than a year before. Higher storage levels entering the spring and summer also equates to lower natural gas demand to refill storage levels. As a result, U.S. natural gas prices fell from above $5 per mmbtu at the end of March 2022 to $2 per mmbtu at the end of March 2023. In our view, pricing for U.S. natural gas will not meaningfully recover until the beginning of winter (with an effective reset on storage levels).With continued organic domestic demand growth and increasing demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the international markets, the intermediate- to long-term outlook for U.S. natural gas prices and necessary production levels remains constructive for U.S. midstream companies.Valuation for U.S. midstream companies remains well below the levels seen before the pandemic. Entering 2020, enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiples stood at roughly 10.5x. Despite the rebound the sector has experienced since the March 2020 lows, the sector today trades at 8.4x — despite what we view as a vastly better business model. Dividend/distribution coverage has moved from 1.1x to more than 2.0x. The sector has moved from being free cash flow negative to free cash flow positive (increasingly so in 2023) and balance sheet leverage (debt/EBITDA) has moved from more than 5.0x to below 3.5x. With no need for midstream companies to access capital markets for the foreseeable future, we increasingly expect excess cash flow (above and beyond capital spending and dividends/distributions) to be used for increasing share buybacks and further increasing dividends/distributions.With improving financial metrics and continued low valuations, we still see solid upside potential for the U.S. midstream sector despite strong performance in 2022 and thus far in 2023.The ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy underperformed its Alerian MLP Index benchmark during the third quarter. In terms of absolute performance, all four subsectors in which the Strategy is invested made positive contributions, with the diversified energy infrastructure subsector contributing the most and the natural gas transportation & storage subsector the main laggard.On a relative basis, the Strategy underperformed due primarily to stock selection effects. In particular, stock selection in the liquids transportation & storage and natural gas transportation & storage subsectors detracted.In terms of individual holdings, Energy Transfer LP (), Targa Resources (), Plains All American Pipeline LP (), Cheniere Energy Partners LP () and Magellan Midstream Partners LP () were the main contributors. The main individual detractors were Enbridge (), TC Energy (), Kinder Morgan (), Hess Midstream LP () and Equitrans Midstream ().During the quarter holding Magellan Midstream Partners LP was acquired by holding ONEOK ().

The Bullish Case For Oil Is Still Compelling,"Not since November of last year have we seen oil prices where they are today. We are close, by far, to the highest pricing that crude has traded at all year. As of this writing, WTI crude, for instance, is at $91.18 per barrel. Not surprisingly, Brent crude isThe last article that I published that covered the oil market generally came out in early April of this year. At that time, I was talking about the new OPEC+ production cut and how that represented a ""massive gift"" to the oil sector. Normally when I talk about investing, I like to identify individual companies that should rise or fall materially. But when it comes to the oil patch, there are many different types of companies to choose from, with each one having a significantly different risk vs. reward payoff compared to the others. For some investors, it just makes it easier to buy into an ETF that appreciates if oil prices rise or drops if they fall.Back then, the ETF I chose as the primary emphasis for my article was  (). But there are plenty of others to choose from, each one with its own positives and negatives. Examples include  (),  (),  (),  (),  (), and  (). To be clear, investors would be wise to evaluate each of these ETFs individually to see which one best fits their own investment preferences and risk appetite. But in general, one thing that these all should have in common is that, as oil prices rise, they should appreciate. This should be true at least in the short term.Regardless of the vehicle that each individual investor chooses to play in the oil market, a case could be made by some that prices are too high and should drop from here. There's certainly data to support that view. Take data provided by the EIA, for instance. In its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook, which was published earlier this month, the agency calculated that, for 2023, global oil supply would come in at about 101.18 million barrels per day. This would be about 0.21 million barrels per day higher than the 100.97 million in consumption that would be experienced. This disparity might not seem like much to some investors. But it could have a major impact on global oil markets if true. The total excess supply, spread over a single year, would be 76.65 million barrels.Now, it's important to point out that just because inventories are rising that this shouldn't necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on oil. It all depends on how much crude already is out there. Generally, the range that should be considered healthy for the environment would be between 55 and 60 days' worth of supply of crude in OECD nations. Whenever this number starts ticking above 60, we start to drift into bearish territory. Based on the STEO report issued, by the end of this year, we should be at roughly 60.57 days' worth of supply for OECD nations. That would translate to excess crude amongst developed nations of 26 million barrels. To make matters worse, the 2024 calendar year should see global demand of 102.88 million barrels per day. That's 0.55 million barrels per day higher than the 102.33 million barrels per day of consumption that has been forecasted. That would translate to 200.75 million barrels of additional crude throughout the year, with OECD inventories climbing to 2.84 billion barrels, or 62.14 days.Looking at the most recently available weekly , we see that domestic crude inventories for the US, excluding what's in the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve), are about 1.27 billion barrels. That's an increase over the 1.23 billion barrels of crude seen one year earlier. However, if we include the SPR into the picture, domestic inventories would have declined from 1.65 billion barrels to 1.62 billion. This is because, in order to combat high oil prices, the US has drained a lot of the oil in the SPR, taking inventories from 422.6 million barrels last year to 351 million this year.So to summarize, what we have on the bearish side of the equation is the EIA forecasting continued growth in production that exceeds consumption. We have evidence in the form of existing inventories of the picture looking worse than it did last year if we ignore the SPR. Although not mentioned previously, oil production also is the highest that it has been in more than two years, with output averaging 12.90 million barrels per day here at home. And you also have high pricing that, in theory, should attract more drillers that would, in turn, cause even more supply to come onto the market.All of this is fine, but there are some issues with the data from what I can see. For starters, while this is not necessarily an issue, the timing for oil prices to climb looks right. Even though the EIA has forecasted excess supply on a global scale for this year in its entirety, the current quarter that we are in, which is the third quarter, should actually see demand outpace supply to the tune of 0.58 million barrels per day. And in the fourth quarter, we should see demand outpace supply by 0.23 million barrels per day. All combined, this should cause global inventories to drop by 74.5 million barrels between the start of the third quarter and the end of this year.But when you dig into the actual data provided by the EIA, you end up with issues as well. For starters, the agency has Russia producing 10.57 million barrels of crude per day in the second quarter and 10.48 million barrels per day in the third quarter. For 2023 as a whole, the estimate is 10.64 million barrels per day. However, Russia has significantly reduced its own output. S&P, for instance, recently estimated that, through 2024, the country should only be producing between 9.4 million and 9.5 million barrels of crude each day. OPEC, however, sees Russia dropping production from 10.85 million barrels per day in the second quarter of this year to only 10.22 million barrels per day in the third quarter. This year as a whole, we're looking at about 10.45 million barrels per day, which would be about 69.4 million barrels of crude, in the aggregate, lower than what the EIA data suggests.There are some other minor differences on the supply side. But the bigger differences involve demand. As an example, OPEC believes that global oil demand this year will average about 102.06 million barrels per day. That's 1.09 million barrels per day higher than what the EIA forecasted. For the third quarter of this year, OPEC believes that its own production would need to be roughly 29.23 million barrels per day in order to match demand. But if we take data provided by the group for the first two months of the third quarter, we're looking at an average of 27.39 million barrels per day. That translates to a deficit of 2.04 million barrels per day. That deficit is likely to grow to 3.32 million barrels per day in the final quarter of this year if OPEC production averages the same amount during that time. And with Saudi Arabia having just reaffirmed its target of keeping production lower by 1 million barrels per day through the rest of this year, that deficit is looking likely.If these estimates turn out to be accurate and if the historical data reported by OPEC for the first and second quarters of this year are correct, then we would be looking at an aggregate deficit of oil this year of 476.1 million barrels. While nobody knows what the future holds, the organization does think that global demand in 2024 will average 104.31 million barrels per day. And even with non-OPEC output slated to rise by 1.45 million barrels per day from 2023 to 2024, the group would need to put out 30.02 million barrels per day next year in order to avoid further shortfalls.As I mentioned earlier in this article, US production is higher than it has been in years. That trend also is looking set to continue. However, it could take quite a while before US output rises enough to bring prices down. For starters, as of August of this year, which is the most recent month for which we have  available, there were only 4,749 DUC wells across the major basins. This is actually down from the 5,191 reported one year earlier. To put this in perspective, in August of 2019, which was right before the COVID-19 pandemic, DUC wells numbered 8,156. The count of wells is often seen as the count of spots from which oil companies can realistically extract crude in a fairly short window of time. That's because a sizable portion of the cost of extracting oil comes from the drilling process. So when drilling is already done, but the entire well is not completed, it can be viewed as a mechanism to quickly ramp up output. But to see the DUC well count fall so low indicates that this potential is limited. In fact, the most recent Drilling Productivity Report issued by the EIA even indicated that production across the major basins should fall, collectively, by 40,000 barrels per day from September to October.At this point in time, I would say that investors probably have more reasons to be bullish on crude than they have reasons to be bearish. Yes, there are certain economic uncertainties and those could play a big role in what happens to pricing from this point on. But absent a major downturn in the economy, the existing balance between supply and demand in crude will have a much larger role in determining what happens with prices. Even though data provided by the EIA is showing a rather bearish situation, the OPEC data indicates otherwise and the market, from a pricing perspective, clearly is on its side. While some may argue that OPEC is not the most reliable source out there, my experience and looking at its data is that it tends to be quite accurate. And when you combine that with a lower DUC count, lower production moving forward in major basins, higher pricing in the market, and lower domestic inventories if we include the SPR, I would argue that the bullish case moving forward is definitely more compelling.Crude Value Insights is a service geared toward investors who are interested in keeping track of oil and gas E&P firms.

FLEX LNG: Lower Spot Freight Rates Weigh On Share Price,"Although Russia remains one of the largest LNG suppliers, the EU has already begun to develop mechanisms to limit future imports of Russian LNG. And since North America, especially the United States, has gradually become one of the largest investors inBut we  that it is too early to invest in FLEX LNG () stock due to market sentiment, driven by high gas storage utilization in the EU, is currently weighing on spot freight prices and, as a result, on FLNG shares. Rating is HOLD.As part of the strategy to phase out Russian fuel by 2027, the EU is reducing its imports of oil, coal and pipeline gas, but still relies on Russian LNG. In order to substitute gas supplies from Russia, the EU  LNG imports by more than 25% from a year earlier. The volume reached a record 94 billion cubic meters during the 2022/23 heating season, with Russia still one of the largest suppliers. LNG, including imports originating in Russia, is becoming a key resource in replacing pipeline gas from Russia. However, the EU has already started to develop mechanisms to limit Russian LNG imports in the future, so other players will eventually take over Russia's share in this market.Over the past years, North America, particularly the US, has  as one of the biggest investors in LNG production. Final investment decisions (FID) in North America were made for a volume in excess of 30 bln cubic meters in the first half of 2022, while the rest of the players had nothing to report. According to Bloomberg, the US plans to take the lead in building up LNG production capacity by 2026.In light of increased LNG imports by the European Union, the US has increased LNG exports to Europe by 30% from a year earlier, solidifying its position as a major gas supplier to Europe.Given the rapid development of LNG production and US leadership in supplying LNG to the EU, the US stands to gain from Europe's future decision to shift away from Russian LNG.In 2Q 2023, average forward 5-year rates fell from the record levels of around $135 thousand per day to $128 thousand per day because much of the EU storage capacity was filled, which reduced gas demand and put pressure on long-term contracts. However, prices of new ships have  by more than 30% over the last two years due to higher LNG demand, along with capacity constraints and lack of available slots at shipyards. We continue to expect newbuild prices and, consequently long-term charter rates, to be rising through the end of 2024, and then decline as the market gradually becomes saturated with new ships.As we have  earlier, FLNG charter rates are sensitive to spot charter prices, which follow the industry's long-term rates, taking into account quarterly seasonality. We expect average charter rates for ships with the capacity of carrying up to 165 thousand tons of LNG to decline from $99.6 thousand to $88.9 thousand per day in 2023, and from $102.1 thousand to $100.4 thousand per day in 2024 due to lower gas demand from the key importer, the European Union.We are lowering the forecast for FLEX LNG's revenue from $384 mln (+10% y/y) to $380 mln (+9% y/y) for 2023, and from $396 mln (+3% y/y) to $382 mln (+0.4% y/y) for 2024 due to the  of average charter rates for ships with the capacity of up to 165 thousand tons of LNG from $99.6 thousand to $88.9 thousand per day for 2023, and from $102.1 thousand to $100.4 thousand per day for 2024.We are lowering the EBITDA forecast from $306 mln (+12% y/y) to $297 mln (+9% y/y) for 2023, and from $314 mln (+3% y/y) to $296 mln (-0.4% y/y) for 2024 due to:We are lowering the target price of the shares from $33.4 to $32 due to:We are maintaining the status of the shares at HOLD. The upside is 10%.We evaluate the company using two methods: the EV/EBITDA multiple method and the EV/market-value-of-the-fleet method. The second method shows the enterprise value is too low compared with the market value of its fleet. The share price target of $32 is the average value of the prices that have been computed according to the two abovementioned methods.Thus, the freight market will remain alluring through the end of 2024: Prices for new LNG tankers will be rising due to a shortage of available capacity and slots at shipyards. FLEX LNG is a promising LNG shipping company. The company operates the youngest fleet, compared with its competition, and is also distinguished by low capital expenditures, which provides it with a very strong competitive advantage over the rest of the players in the industry. But we still believe that it is too early to invest in FLEX LNG stock due to market sentiment, driven by high gas storage utilization in the EU, is currently weighing on spot freight prices and, as a result, on FLNG shares. Rating is HOLD.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

Follow Buffett And 'Never Bet Against America',"When planning to write this article, I was thinking about how to name it properly so that the title that would be chosen would be able to efficiently convey my message. After spending some time thinking about what titleThe idea behind using Warren Buffett's phrase  as a title for this specific article is fairly simple. After the challenging 2022, there was a lot of pessimism about the state of the American economy and a lot of talks about the decline of American influence around the globe. This narrative continues to be spread out even today despite the resilience of the American economy.Therefore, the goal of this article is to highlight why it’s still foolish to bet against America, why U.S.-based assets are likely to remain the best type of investments out there, and why the companies within the S&P 500 Index ()()() are likely to outperform its foreign peers in years to come.Ever since the start of 2022, we constantly heard that the recession is imminent and that the stock market is doomed. However, besides the two-quarters of negative growth, the American economy remained resilient, the job market remained strong, and the overall GDP in 2022 by 2.06%.In addition to this, a lot of people forget that the rise of oil and food prices that greatly contributed to the rising inflation was caused primarily by the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which led to the disruption of energy and fertilizer supplies for several quarters in a row. As those supply chain issues started to get fixed, the inflation began to decrease, and prices started to stabilize. Even though a year ago the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil production cuts took off over 2% of the from the market to prop up the prices, there’s an indication that such a move is starting to backfire.Despite the Saudi attempts to push the prices significantly higher, the latest EIA indicates that the average price for Brent crude oil in 2023 and 2024 will be below $90 per barrel, which is also below the average 2022 levels. This would be possible thanks to the increase in oil production by the non-OPEC countries that could undermine the OPEC+ cuts. The biggest increase in production is expected to take place in the United States, which has been its production after the COVID-related slump in 2020 and is expected to reach a new record of producing an average of 13.16 million barrels of oil per day in 2024.What’s more, is that the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted the European countries to look for a more stable supplier of natural gas so that they no longer rely on the dictatorial regime that threatens to undermine the international world order. Russia has been known to be an supplier for years and has been the natural gas market for a long time, but only the full-scale invasion of Ukraine made Europeans act more strategically. As of today, American LNG supplies continue to flow to Europe at a record pace and help American natural gas generate aggressive returns despite the increase in natural gas production, as they’re profiting at.All of those developments indicate that the United States economy is more resilient than a lot of people expected. At the same time, there are more reasons to be optimistic about the country’s future and its strategic posture across the globe. We already saw how stocks appreciated at a double-digit rate in the last year and even the banking crisis in March was quickly dealt with, which helped the market to continue to grow at an impressive rate.There’s also a simple explanation for all of this. Markets are driven by the and not by the fundamentals. If there’s an indication that the worst is behind, you can be certain that the market would react to it much quicker than the underlying fundamentals. That’s exactly what has happened in the last year and there are reasons to believe that it will be the case for years to come.There’s no denying that the world is changing, and American exceptionalism is no longer the norm in this new multipolar world. However, despite all the domestic and foreign challenges that the U.S. is currently facing, I would argue that it’s still the best market to invest in. Even though it’s likely that higher rates will stay with us for longer due to the inability to fully outsource the production to low-cost labor countries anymore to keep prices of goods elevated and drive inflation down, there are still more than enough opportunities to generate meaningful returns at home.Before highlighting some of the opportunities, it’s important to understand the environment in which investors will now be operating. If the fall of the Soviet Union and later the admission of China to the WTO made our world more connected and interdependent, then the great financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine all contributed to the rise of geopolitical risks that kicked off the trend of deglobalization. The latest suggests that since November of 2008, there have been over 40,000 protectionism measures such as the enactment of tariffs or subsidies implemented by various governments across the globe against less than 10,000 free market measures. As countries begin to secure their supply chains and protect their markets in this new environment, the deglobalization talks will likely dominate the national discourse for years to come.For the United States, this new environment presents both challenges and opportunities. The biggest challenge that the U.S. should tackle is the need to ensure that the rising debt doesn’t spiral out of control. Decades of fiscal irresponsibility, countless QE programs, and aggressive money printing during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a record public debt-to-GDP ratio that gives little room for mistakes for policymakers and Fed officials.At the same time, it’s not entirely correct to focus on the amount of debt that the U.S. owes since as long as the economy grows and the debt-to-GDP ratio is on the decline, the country would be able to service its debt and avoid a worst-case scenario. If we look at the latest data, we’ll see that the debt-to-GDP ratio is indeed on the decline from its record highs in part thanks to the growth of the economy that was discussed above. At the same time, such a decline in part is also possible thanks to the government’s ability to inflate the debt away. Here’s how it:The upside of this strategy is that the government doesn’t need to impose painful austerity measures that result in a loss of votes during the election cycle. The issue though is that it’s still a type of financial repression measure that undermines the purchasing power of the citizens. That’s why inflating the debt away should be considered only a short-term measure and stimulating growth should be a priority.A year ago, famous investor Russell Napier gave a great in which he argued that governments will begin to enact financial repression measures to inflate the debt away and at the same time implement policies that would lead to an increase in capital expenditures to stimulate growth. Fast forward to today and we can see that it’s exactly what the government has been doing all this time. In addition to inflating the debt away, the current U.S. administration has been advocating for the implementation of various growth policies to keep the economy going and avoid a hard landing that could’ve been caused by higher interest rates. That’s where the opportunities kick in.As China is becoming a systemic rival of the United States and is increasing its ability to undermine the international world order that was initially established at the end of WW2, the American policymakers along with the Biden administration decided to finally implement an industrial policy. Its goal is fairly simple. Since China no longer could be trusted, now is the time to move the manufacturing that previously was outsourced overseas back home. The passage of laws such as the  and  are prime examples of a policy that aims to expand the domestic industrial base in sectors that are of vital importance to American national interests.Over the last year, hundreds of billions of dollars have been used on funding various industries and there’s an that around $2 trillion in additional federal spending is being freed up over the next decade. All of that funding is resulting in a CAPEX boom as companies use the federal funds to expand their businesses on American soil with the final goal of creating new growth opportunities.What’s more is that in addition to the government-led efforts to stimulate growth, private companies are also taking the initiative into their own hands and looking for additional ways to decrease their exposure to China. In the last year, there has been an in the use of terms such as  and , which is a strategy of moving manufacturing and supply chains closer to home.We already see companies like Tesla () and HP () move some of their production to Mexico, which has recently the biggest trading partner of the United States, overtaking China. Such a move can decrease the geopolitical risks of the businesses as the U.S. relations with Mexico are likely to be more stable over the long-term. At the same time, this helps businesses continue to benefit from the cheaper labor cost that in the end results in greater growth.Last but not least, technological innovation is another catalyst that’s able to stimulate growth. The robotization of the workforce along with the automation of the business processes are able to decrease the operational costs of companies and let them use the spare resources to acquire more customers. In addition to that, the aggressive growth of the generative AI industry also offers a great opportunity for businesses to expand their TAM. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs () published a that stated that generative AI could raise global GDP by 7% in the following years. If that’s the case, it would make the government’s job of stimulating growth and decreasing its debt-to-GDP ratio much easier.All of those developments indicate that there are more than enough growth opportunities for investors to profit from even in the current environment with higher interest rates. Below there’s a comparison chart that shows that even though the overall market appreciated by ~14% in the last year, ETFs that hold Mexican (), AI (), semiconductor (), and uranium () companies that have been one of the greatest beneficiaries of the changing market landscape or government’s efforts to stimulate growth outperformed the S&P 500.Considering everything that has been stated above, it’s safe to say that Russell Napier is likely to be right and that the CAPEX boom is going to remain with us for a while. This means that there are always going to be industries that the government favors more over others and various growth opportunities could be found in such industries as could be seen in the chart above.Even though investors now need to operate in a completely different environment than in the last two decades, as the return of the zero interest rate policy is not around the corner given the changing geopolitical landscape, there are still more than enough opportunities to generate meaningful returns in the right industries. What’s more, is that the resilience of the American economy during the challenging 2022 also shows that the U.S. remains to be the best market to invest in at this stage. The chart below shows that the ETF that mirrors the S&P 500 Index has outperformed ETFs that hold stocks of companies from BRICS nations such as China (), South Africa (), Brazil (), and India ().The world is in disarray and it's time to build a portfolio that will weather all the systemic shocks that will come your way.  offers you exactly that!

Midstream Income For Life,"Sometimes I really think about how simple my one-year-old grandson’s life is.Asher doesn’t read the news. Or pay the bills. Or even know what the news or bills are.What a happy state of existence!Then again, he also has people dictating what he eats, when he eats, how he eats, and where he eats. As well as why he eats what he eats when, how, and where.The same goes for naptimes, bedtimes, playtimes, the toys he has, what he wears… Pretty much his whole entire world is determined by outside forces. Which, I’m sure, can get frustrating.I’ve seen the proof since, like most babies (and, let’s face it, most adults too), Asher isn’t always fond of being told “no.” Then again, considering the news and bills due these days…Maybe the tradeoff is worth it?Life is expensive. And involved. And as we keep seeing through the economic headlines (and in person), it’s getting more expensive and involved still. Sure, the inflation rate is down, but inflation itself is not.It’s just headed higher more slowly than before. So any additional money we can bring in is important to talk about.That’s why I’ve been writing this “Income for Life” series. First, I published “.” Then it was “.”And now we’re onto a third installment, this one focused on energy.Energy, of course, is part of the reason why life is so expensive right now.It’s not the entire reason, mind you. I’m well aware of that and not trying to start any fights about what else is and isn’t involved in our pocket pains.But I think we can all agree that the fuel situation isn’t helping. As the cost of transportation goes higher – whether by plane, ship, truck, or whatever – the price tags of everything else tend to follow. This only makes sense for anything that needs to be transported, from raw goods to finished products at the end of the manufacturing line.There’s no escaping it. Whether you’re shopping for a house, new furniture and appliances, food, or whatever you buy from Amazon, costs are up.So why not profit from those expenditures if possible? Which, as “Energy Income for Life” is about to show you, it is.I’m not talking about buying and selling oil directly, mind you. Commodities trading is complex and volatile. It’s not a headache I care to have. And I wouldn’t wish it on anyone else who doesn’t have the time, money, knowledge, and wisdom it takes to make it work.I believe in investing in companies that do have all that going for them instead. Let them deal with all the industry ins and outs.I just want to kick back, relax, and take a cut of the profits. Or, perhaps I should put it this way considering how much else there is to deal with these days…I don’t want another set of responsibilities on my shoulders if I don’t have to. Which, in this case, I don’t.Neither do you.That’s one small part of why energy fits so perfectly into my “Income for Life” series. The companies that deal with and in it perform a certain way, offering essential services wrapped up in neat little boxes tied with bows.Take real estate investment trusts, or REITs. They own entire portfolios of properties, where they’re in charge of finding tenants, maintaining tenants, and collecting rent from those tenants.REIT investors don’t have to worry about any of that hassle. (And take it from a former landlord… it can be a major hassle.)Business development companies, or BDCs, meanwhile, are financial institutions that lend money to the otherwise “unlendable.” Businesses that can’t easily find fiscal backing– whether because they’re small, struggling, or in a problematic industry – can very often turn to a BDC for help.The BDC researches them, determines the most viable terms to work with them, and monitors the borrower and borrowings from there. Then they summarize all of that for their investors to read over while sipping on a cup of coffee or tea.Maybe even a cocktail on some sandy beach.Energy companies do the same, just with portfolios of… well… energy.You could argue that description fits a larger array of stocks than I’ve mentioned above, I know. So here’s the real reason to keep reading: Dual profit potential.REITs and BDCs reward their shareholders:And so do the energy companies I’m about to dive into. Today, I’ve got three particular picks to recommend.Two of them are dividend aristocrats with plenty of growth potential!Before we continue, bear in mind that MLPs do not technically pay dividends. They are called . Also, shares are called . For everyone’s convenience, I’ll go with dividends and shares in this article, as not all picks are MLPs, so please do not be confused.I start this article with the gold standard of midstream companies. The company isn’t just one of the oldest and best-managed master limited partnerships, or MLPs, but it also enjoys our highest quality ratings among midstream companies.As the sub-title already shows, that company is Enterprise Products Partners.Founded in 1968, Enterprise Products Partners has become one of the most important companies in the North American energy grid, as it now manages more than 50,000 miles of pipeline, storage capable of holding more than 260 million barrels of liquids, 30 natural gas processing plants, 25 fractionators to produce value-added products, and 20 deep-water docks to service overseas energy demand.Last year, the company made roughly 42% of its money in the Natural Gas Liquids Pipelines & Services segment. 32% of its sales came from the Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment. The remaining dollars came from Petrochemical & Refined Products Services and Natural Gas Pipelines & Services.Essentially, this giant combines all important feedstocks to buyers that turn these into products we use every day. This includes fertilizers, food packages, water pipes, medical supplies, helmets, diapers, lubricants, tires, paints, and obviously gasoline and diesel.In addition to this, the company helps companies expand production in critical areas like the mighty Permian basin, the only basin capable of keeping American shale production in an uptrend.In 2023/2024, the company is bringing four new gas plants online, scheduled to increase processing by 1.2 billion cubic feet per day.On top of that, the company helps America to increasingly export its fossil fuels. This isn’t just a benefit in light of rapid middle-class growth in emerging markets but also a necessity in light of the Ukraine war, where fossil fuels are used as leverage.Right now, Europe barely receives any natural gas from Russia, putting tremendous pressure on the U.S. to keep the lights in Europe from going out.One of the reasons – if not THE reason – why EPD is such a high-quality stock is its consistent financial performance. Like its peers, the company is spending billions on new infrastructure. However, the company is older and had a large (profitable) network in place when others were still in the early phases of expansion.A lot of MLPs cut their dividends in 2015 when high investment requirements met imploding commodity prices and lower demand.EPD did not cut its dividend.Even better! EPD is a dividend aristocrat with 25 consecutive years of dividend hikes.Since 1999, the company has covered its dividend every single year, using its consistently rising distributable cash flow.This dividend isn’t just backed by consistently rising distributable cash flow but also a healthy balance sheet.The company enjoys an A- credit rating with an average weighted cost of debt of just 4.6%. It has no debt maturities in 2023.Next year, the company is expected to generate $5.8 billion in free cash flow, which implies a 10% free cash flow yield. This covers the 7.5% dividend and investments in growth/maintenance with a wide margin of error.With regard to growth, the dividend has a 5-year CAGR of 2.8%, which beats the Fed’s inflation target.While it needs to be seen what the company is up to, it is not unlikely that dividend growth will accelerate a bit in the next few years.The current market capitalization of the company, along with its expected net debt and potential EBITDA, puts its estimated EBITDA for 2024 at 8.9x.This also includes the minority interest income streams the company doesn't fully own, which are valued at roughly $1.0 billion.Despite this, the valuation is still attractive when compared to the company's usual trading range of close to 10x EBITDA.Based on this, the company's fair value is estimated to be 18% above its current unit price.iREIT has a rating on the stock.Energy Transfer is a comeback stock.During the pandemic, the company cut its dividend. Now, it’s back with a very bright future ahead!With a market cap exceeding $42 billion, this giant is going back into the M&A game.Last month, it made an offer to buy Crestwood () in a $7.1 billion deal (including debt), which would make it one of the best-diversified midstream giants.ET would expand its footprint in oil-weighted basins and increase its exposure to some of the Nation’s largest upstream companies. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal might close in the fourth quarter.Even without these assets, ET is one of the largest midstream companies in North America, servicing all major basins in the South, the Powder River basin, and the Williston basin.The company owns 34% of Sunoco LP (), which distributes motor fuels to independent dealers and operates 76 retail stores in Hawaii and New Jersey.While its market cap is a pretty good indicator of its size, there are a few impressive numbers I want to share with you. For example, the company gathers roughly 20 million MMBtu of gas per day and transports more than 4 million barrels of crude oil per day. It is capable of exporting roughly a quarter of that in its own facilities.90% of its EBITDA is dependent on fees, which means that commodity price fluctuations aren’t a major issue – at least not compared to companies that actually produce oil and gas.Energy Transfer is also a stock that shows a lot of conviction from its management. Not only does it have one of the highest insider ownership rates in the country (>12%), but it is also mainly owned by retail investors, who own roughly 50% of all units.Thanks to its mature business and strong tailwinds consisting of rising global demand for natural gas, oil, and refined products, the company is in a good spot to protect and grow its dividend while focusing on growth opportunities.The company’s long-term capital allocation strategy aims to distribute more than half of its distributable cash flow to shareholders. Roughly a quarter of its discounted cash, or DCF, will be used to grow the business. 7% to 20% will be used to reduce debt and buy back units/shares.Thanks to its focus on debt reduction, the company has a much healthier balance sheet.It is expected that the net debt at the end of this year will be $50.3 billion, which is likely to decrease gradually to $46 billion by 2025. Taking into account the gradual increase in EBITDA, the estimated net leverage ratio for 2025 is 3.4x EBITDA.The company's current credit rating is BBB-, which is one level below the company's target rating of BBB. With a positive outlook from Fitch, a rating upgrade may be imminent.With regard to its dividend, the company has a juicy 9.1% yield, which comes with strong free cash flow protection. The company is expected to maintain a 13% free cash flow yield before a surge to 15% in 2025. Please note that free cash flow takes growth and maintenance capital spending into account.In other words, the dividend is safe, not only because of a healthy balance sheet but also because the company is finally producing consistent free cash flow.This also helps the company’s valuation. After all, a 9.1% yield is a huge deal! It’s the highest yield we discuss in this article.The company is trading at just 7.4x NTM EBITDA, which is below any of its peers. While ET has a history of cutting its dividend, it is now a much stronger player, which warrants a higher valuation.The current consensus analyst price target is $17. This is 25% above the current price.Given the bigger picture, that’s more than fair!The third midstream company is no MLP. Enbridge is a Canada-based C-Corp, which means it does not issue a K-1 form.Like its American peer, Energy Products Partners, it’s one of the most reliable dividend payers in the industry. The company has a track record of 28 consecutive annual dividend increases. Since 2002, the dividend has been hiked by 12% per year.However, in this case, investors need to be aware that Enbridge pays its dividends in Canadian dollars, which means dividend growth for foreign investors is dependent on the Canadian dollar.The company currently pays CAD 0.8875 per share per quarter, which translates to a yield of 7.3%.Taking a step back, Enbridge is a giant. With a market cap of $72 billion, the company is a giant in its industry, connecting energy producers to customers in North America and Europe.Headquartered in Calgary, the company operates the world’s longest and most complex crude oil and liquids transportation system, with more than 17,800 miles of active pipelines in North America.Every day, the company delivers more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and liquids via its Mainline and Express networks.The company transports roughly 30% of total North American crude oil production, 65% of U.S.-bound Canadian exports, and 40% of total U.S. crude oil imports!Not only does this company have a massive moat, but it also has a well-covered dividend.This year, the company is expected to generate $8.9 billion in free cash flow, which results in a 9.1% free cash flow yield, indicating an 80% cash payout ratio that supports the safety of the dividend.On top of that, the company has a BBB+ credit rating and a highly favorable business model.For example, 98% of the company's anticipated 2023 EBITDA comes from regulated assets or long-term take-or-pay contracts.Approximately 51% of these assets fall under the take-or-pay plus category. These assets are backed by extended agreements with inflation protection and cost-sharing provisions.Roughly 47% of the EBITDA is characterized by low risk, resembling utility-like stability with minimal volatility.The company also enjoys one of the strongest customer bases. 95% of its customers have an investment-grade rating, meaning it is unlikely to suffer from bankrupt customers in the event of severe economic weakness.While this goes for many of its peers, ENB is at the very top when it comes to benefiting from strong customers.Enbridge is also growing through strategic investments. For example, the company aims to boost its market share in the Gulf Coast’s LNG exports. It targets a market share increase from 15% to 30% by 2030, making Enbridge one of the most important players in America’s plans to become a go-to-market for liquid natural gas.These growth programs are expected to provide the company with roughly 5% average annual compounding EBITDA growth in the 2022-2025 period, boosted by toll escalators (higher prices for pipeline usage), organic expansions, and growth projects.Bear in mind that the company is growing without risking the safety of its dividend, as the aforementioned free cash flow numbers account for maintenance and growth CapEx.Having said that, ENB isn’t having a good year. The stock is down 9% in New York. Shares have lost a quarter of their value since the 2022 peak.Shares are now trading at 11.6x forward EBITDA. As the valuation chart we discussed in the Energy Transfer part of this article showed, it’s one of the most valuations. However, the company usually trades close to 16x EBITDA, which reflects its stronger financials and growth potential.Analysts currently give the stock a consensus price target of $43, which is 21% above the current price.This is fair. On a longer-term basis, I expect higher and more consistent gains, backed by consistent dividend growth and the benefit from growth investments in new energy projects like LNG.In today's world of complex financial decisions and ever-rising expenses, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. But as I explored the world of ""Income for Life,"" focusing on energy investments, I found a way to simplify and secure my financial future.Just like my one-year-old grandson, Asher, who lives a carefree life without worrying about bills or news, I realized that I don't need the added responsibility of managing commodities trading.

Imperial Petroleum: Sugarcoating An Ugly Related-Party Deal - Sell,"  Last week, Imperial Petroleum surprisingly  a $10 million share repurchase program despite having just closedApparently, there's not much sense in returning recently raised funds to investors, particularly not when considering management's  ofAt least in my opinion, the share repurchase program was announced to sugarcoat another ugly related-party deal (emphasis added by author):Quite frankly, I have no idea why the company's independent directors approved a transaction that resulted in Imperial Petroleum overpaying by almost $10 million as VesselsValue  the combined market value of the vessels at just $61.2 million.Moreover, the acquisition of the Aframax tanker  makes the recent  of the very similar  to spin-off C3is () look even more .However, with the family of CEO Harry Vafias controlling the company's vessel management company, Stealth Maritime, and the management agreement providing for a 1% fee """", selling vessels from Stealth Maritime to Imperial Petroleum and further to C3is apparently generates a decent amount of fees for the Vafias family.In case of the , the newbuilding contract was  by StealthGas () from a Vafias family-controlled entity in 2010 for $56.5 million. The vessel was part of the Imperial Petroleum  in late 2021 before being sold to C3is in July for $43.0 million.Please note that both StealthGas and C3is have similar management agreements with Stealth Maritime and Brave Maritime respectively, another Vafias family-controlled entity.As a result, the recent sale of the  from Imperial Petroleum to C3is has resulted in both companies paying the 1% fee to their respective, Vafias-controlled managers:Please note that there's nothing that would prevent the sale of  back to Imperial Petroleum or any other company also managed by Stealth Maritime/Brave Maritime at some point going forward to further maximize fees.With last week's purchase of  and , Imperial Petroleum's fleet will increase from nine to eleven vessels, so still ways to go until management's near-term fleet expansion target will be reached.With the Vafias family selling the vessels to Imperial Petroleum at a large premium to market value, overall net asset value (""NAV"") has been reduced by approximately 3%:Even worse, this most recent related-party dealing resulted in the Vafias family extracting $71 million in cash from the company thus reducing Imperial Petroleum's pro forma cash position from $114.6 million to $43.4 million.This is actually bad news for holders of Imperial Petroleum's 8.75% Series A Preferred Shares () as their margin of safety has decreased.Imperial Petroleum continues to engage in related-party dealings with entities controlled by the family of CEO Harry Vafias to the detriment of shareholders.Moreover, considering management's aggressive near-term fleet expansion targets, I do not expect Imperial Petroleum to utilize its new $10 million share repurchase program anytime soon if ever. In fact, I would anticipate more dilution sooner rather than later to finance additional vessel purchases.Given management's course of action, it can hardly be considered a surprise that shares are trading at an approximately 90% discount to net asset value, very similar to other relentless diluters in the Greek shipping space like Castor Maritime (), Globus Maritime (), Performance Shipping () and OceanPal ().With further dilution much more likely than share repurchases, I am reiterating my """" rating on the common shares.In addition, with the latest related party dealing resulting in a large cash drain for Imperial Petroleum, I am downgrading the company's 8.75% Series A Preferred Shares to """" from """" due to the decreased margin of safety for preferred shareholders.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

"Taiwan Semi rises as Taiwan exports surge, may receive more AI orders next year","Taiwan Semiconductor () shares rose fractionally in pre-market trading as the country's Ministry of Finance announced a sharp rise in exports, aided in part by a near 60% year-over-year rise in technology.According to official  released by the country, exportsExports rose all across the globe, as sales of products to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, U.S. and Europe rose 24.8%, 17.7% and 21.3%, respectively. Exports to Mainland China and Hong Kong and Japan, however, fell 8.8% and 15.1%, respectively.Overall exports rose 3.4% to $38.81B, the country said.

Nvidia slumps on new US-China chip curbs; says no 'meaningful impact' in near-term,"Nvidia's () stock fell  on Tuesday after the U.S. brought in new updates which would curb the sale of chips that Nvidia () made for the Chinese market, part of Washington's export restrictions aimed at hindering China'sNvidia (), however, does not expect a near-term meaningful impact on its financial results.""We comply with all applicable regulations while working to provide products that support thousands of applications across many different industries,"" Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Seeking Alpha. ""Given the demand worldwide for our products, we don’t expect a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results.""Citi Research's analysts noted that last quarter, Nvidia mentioned that China demand was within the historical range of 20-25% of their data center revenue. Given the strength of its AI demand, Nvidia previously commented that additional export restrictions, if adopted, would not have an immediate material impact to financial results. However, over the long term, this would represent a permanent sales loss, according to the analysts.The new restrictions will target Nvidia's A800 and H800 chips, Bloomberg News  citing a senior U.S. official. These were created for export to China after the U.S. unveiled its initial restrictions in October 2022.The new rules also require companies to notify the U.S. government before selling chips which go below the controlled threshold, the report added.Top-line chips are best for artificial intelligence, or AI, models. However, with enough money and a little jury-rigging, a whole class of slightly inferior chips could also be used for AI and supercomputing thus pose a national security risk, according to a senior administration official.The updated restrictions broadly allow the sale of advanced commercial chips to Chinese companies for use in consumer products such as smartphones, computers and electric vehicles. However, the U.S. government will curb the most advanced consumer chips — such as those used in AI data centers — and impose a notification process on certain varieties just behind the cutting edge, the report noted.The U.S. will also need companies to get a license to sell chips to more than 40 countries which Chinese companies could use as intermediaries to go around the U.S. controls. It will add two Chinese businesses and their units to a trade restriction list which requires companies to get a U.S. government license before shipping to those firms, the report noted.The Biden administration is also expanding the scope of manufacturing gear subject to curbs. On the question if the U.S. would restrict less advanced DUV machines, which are mainly supplied by Dutch company ASML () (), an administration official noted that the U.S. has worked with the Netherlands on the policy.Intel (), Advanced Micro Devices (), Marvell Technology (), and Broadcom () were all down about  each, while Qualcomm () had dipped  on Tuesday.In August, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order to regulate certain U.S. investments in China in three areas — semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence, or AI.

Marathon Oil: Risk Factors In Gas Valuation And Limited Returns (Rating Downgrade),"Marathon Oil Corporation () produces oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas in the US and the African country of Equatorial Guinea. Last year it acquired private natural-gas focused Eagle Ford company Ensign Natural Resources.In the US, MarathonAs  I do not recommend Marathon Oil to dividend hunters due to its very slender 1.5% dividend. However, I am also changing my recommendation for growth hunters from “buy” to “hold.The primary reasons for this change are a) unlike some of its competitors, more than half of the company’s production is lower-valued natural gas and natural gas liquids, b) it has leaned further into natural gas with the Ensign purchase, c) given the acquisition of EnsignThe company has committed to return at least 40% of annual operating cash flow to investors when WTI oil prices are $60/bbl or above, which it does primarily through share repurchases.Despite similar names, Marathon Oil is an upstream oil and gas company distinct from Marathon Petroleum Corporation (), a downstream refiner.US refinery operable capacity is  The US produces 12.7 million BPD of oil domestically. Canada supplies the largest percentage of US oil imports.The Biden administration has drawn the Strategic Petroleum Reserve down to its lowest level (348.4 million barrels or about 49% of capacity) in years. Due to sanctions, Russia has redirected its oil supplies from the EU to India and China. Both factors, along with supply cuts from OPEC, may continue to press oil prices upward.In the  Marathon Oil reported net income of $287 million, or $0.47/diluted share. However, despite added Ensign production volumes, Net operating cash flow for 2Q23 was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $442 million.The company returned $434 million to shareholders in 2Q23, most ($372 million) in the form of share repurchases.Marathon produced 399,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D); of that, oil was 189,000 net barrels per day (BPD), or 47%.The graphs show total hydrocarbon and oil/condensate production by region. (A portion of Eagle Ford oil is lighter condensate.)The August 18, 2023, oil futures price was $81.26/barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil delivered in September 2023.Forward WTI prices are flat, declining slightly by mid-2024.On August 17, 2023, when WTI was $80.39/barrel, the price for —a proxy for the Eagle Ford price--was $79.60/barrel.The North Dakota Light Sweet oil price (Bakken) is typically less than the WTI price due to differences in transportation and marketsThe price for Bakken crude a day earlier—August 16, 2023--was $72.23/barrel.For the week ending August 11, 2023, This is only 0.4 million BPD less than the highest-ever level of US oil production of 13.1 MMBPD in February-March 2020.For September 2023, Bakken oil or 9.4% of total US oil production. Eagle Ford oil is predicted to be 1.1 MMBPD or 8.7% of total US production. By contrast, Permian oil is predicted to be 5.8 MMBPD, or 46% of the total.Of this, Marathon’s oil/condensate volumes represent 1.4% of total US oil production.August 18, 2023, Henry Hub, Louisiana, natural gas futures price for September 2023 delivery was $2.57/MMBTU.While the “free” or “waste” gas from the Permian is not ramping up at the same breakneck pace as earlier (except as the Permian matures and gets gassier), it is worth noting right now outweighs demand of 100 BCF/D. Yes, increased demand for electrical generation—both baseload and renewables back-up—helps, as does the prospect of increased LNG export demand. However, expect market-starved Appalachian gas to compete more heavily once Mountain Valley Pipeline is complete. Appalachian gas is 35.7 BCF/D; Permian is 23.7 BCF/D; by contrast, Eagle Ford is 7.5 BCF/D.Marathon’s gas production represents 0.46% of total US gas supply.In its the Energy Information Administration (EIA) provided 5-95 confidence intervals for US oil and gas futures prices through the end of 2024, shown below.On November 2, 2022, Marathon  private Eagle Ford company Ensign Natural Resources for  The transaction closed at the end of 2022 with an effective date of October 1, 2022.Ensign’s production at that time was about 67,000 BOE/D total, including 22,000 BPD of oil. Marathon also acquired 130,000 net acres (99% operated, 97% working interest, 700 wells, 600 undrilled locations) adjacent to its own acreage in the condensate, wet gas, and dry gas phase windows of the Eagle Ford. This acquisition gives Marathon a total of 290,000 Eagle Ford acres.In retrospect, while companies were eager to get gas for LNG export, the timing given the high gas prices of 2022 could have led to an overvaluation problem similar to (but smaller) than the one ExxonMobil faced when it acquired XTO.On December 31, 2022, Marathon's  This divides as 91% US and 9% Equatorial Guinea. Of the total, 48% was crude oil and condensate.The SEC PV-10 value of the reserves was $22.2 billion  using the following reference prices:*WTI oil price of $93.67/bbl*Mont Belvieu NGL price of $36.59/bbl*Henry Hub natural gas price of Marathon Oil Corporation is  in Houston, Texas.Some of Marathon Oil’s Eagle Ford competitors include BP (), ConocoPhillips (), Devon Energy (), EOG Resources (), SilverBow Resources (), and  ().Public companies competing with Marathon in the Bakken/Williston Basin are Chord Energy (), private Continental Resources, ConocoPhillips, Devon, EOG Resources, Hess (), and ExxonMobil.Marathon Oil also competes with companies in Oklahoma, in the Permian, and with private companies.Marathon Oil’s largest competitor in Equatorial Guinea is Exxon Mobil.On August 1, 2023, Institutional Shareholder Services ranked Marathon Oil’s overall governance as a 4, with sub-scores of audit (4), board (5), shareholder rights (5), and compensation (4). In this ranking a 1 indicates lower governance risk and a 10 indicates higher governance risk.Short shares are 2.1% of floated shares on July 31, 2023. Insiders own a small 0.4% of outstanding stock.Marathon Oil’s beta of 2.38 represents considerably more volatility than the overall market but is in line with cyclic oil and gas prices.On June 29, 2023, much of Marathon Oil’s stock was held by institutions, some of which represents index fund investments that match the overall market. The three largest institutional holders of Marathon’s stock were Vanguard (12.0%), BlackRock (8.2%), and State Street (6.85%).BlackRock and State Street are signatories to the  a group that, as of June 30, 2023, manages trillion in assets worldwide and which (despite disrupted energy supply due to rerouting of Russian energy exports from Europe to Asia) limits hydrocarbon investment via its commitment to achieve net zero alignment by 2050 The company’s 52-week price range is $20.57-$33.42 per share, so its August 18, 2023, closing price of $26.39/share is  of the 52-week high and  of the one-year target of $32.18. Market capitalization is Marathon Oil’s trailing twelve months’ earnings per share (EPS) is $4.14 for a bargain price/earnings ratio of 6.4. The averages of analysts’ 2023 and 2024 EPS estimates are $2.41 and $3.39, respectively, for a forward price-earnings ratio range of Twelve-month returns on assets and equity, while both good at 8.3% and 18.0% respectively, are not as strong as some competitors.Trailing twelve-months operating cash flow is excellent at $4.6 billion and levered free cash flow is good at $1.6 billion.Marathon Oil’s annual dividend is $0.40/share for a yield of 1.5%.MRO has a share repurchase authorization that helps meet its commitment to return a minimum of 40% of cash flow from operations to equity investors when WTI oil prices are $60/bbl or more.At June 30, 2023, the company had  in liabilities including $5.7 billion of long-term debt. Marathon Oil had $19.9 billion in assets giving it a liability-to-asset ratio of . The debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3.The company’s mean analyst rating is 2.5: between “buy” and “hold”. At least one analyst considers the stock very undervalued.With an enterprise value (EV) of $21.4 billion, the EV/EBITDA ratio is a small 4.7, well below the maximum preferred ratio of 10 or less, suggesting the stock is a bargain.The company’s book value per share of $18.55 is below the current market price, indicating positive investor sentiment.Market capitalization per flowing BOE is $40,900 while the market cap per flowing barrel of oil is $89,200. This more-than-doubling reflects the inclusion of lower-valued natural gas and natural gas liquids in the BOE calculation.Current enterprise value is $21.4 billion and market capitalization is $16.3 billion. On June 30, 2023, the company had assets of $19.9 billion and liabilities of $8.7 billion including $5.7 billion of long-term debt. The company’s December 31, 2022, SEC PV-10 asset value was $22.2 billion.Potential investors should consider their oil and natural gas price expectations as the factors most likely to affect Marathon Oil. While the Eagle Ford is prolific and sizable, its reserves are also smaller (and more gas-prone) than those in the Permian. It is possible Marathon will not realize synergies from its Ensign acquisition or may have overpaid for it.The Bakken Tier 1 oil core is smaller than the Permian.There is US political risk as the Biden administration continues anti-US-hydrocarbon policies.Equatorial Guinea depends on oil and gas production for its GDP and fiscal revenues: it and Marathon Oil are incentivized to keep volumes flowing.I am changing my recommendation for Marathon Oil from buy to hold. Its shareholder return program is not competitive, and its capital appreciation prospects don't make up for that lack. While all companies with natural gas are likely to see lower reserve values at year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022, Marathon specifically may have overpaid for its $3 billion gas-focused Ensign acquisition, made during a period of abnormally high gas prices.Laura Starks is the CEO of Starks Energy Economics, LLC and has a degree in chemical engineering and an MBA with a concentration in finance which she has used to invest personally and share her ideas about energy companies for many years.

"Chevron looked at Occidental Petroleum earlier this year, interest has waned - WSJ","Chevron () was interested in Occidental Petroleum (), one of the largest producers in the Permian basin, in the early part of this year, though the oil giant's interest has waned in recent months.

Six Themes On Artificial Intelligence To Consider,"One of the big trends in markets throughout 2023 has been artificial intelligence, or AI.I tend to avoid jumping into crowded themes (sometimes to my benefit, sometimes to my detriment), so AI is not something I have written much about publicly. I preferI did cover the topic in a May  report and then again partially in a July  report. It has been a topic I’ve been following closely despite not writing heavily about yet, and this issue will draw from those prior reports and more recent information to cover some of the themes that I think are worthwhile to think about, that I don’t see getting a lot of coverage.The takes on AI have ranged from “this is all hype and there’s nothing here” to “it’s going to kill us all in five years and take over the world”.Unsurprisingly, I fall somewhere between those two extremes, where I think there are clearly major breakthroughs here but any emergent technology will be prone to hype cycles and will get ahead of itself from time to time.Anyone who has taken the time to use some of the latest tools can see the value here, which didn’t exist a few years ago. As the technology matures and becomes ubiquitous, of course it’ll have a significant economic impact.However, any exponential technology is hard to map out with a long timeline. But a useful exercise is to figure out what the right  are, even if we don’t necessarily know all of the  to those questions. There’s nothing worse than not even knowing what questions to ask, or what the potential bounds or bottlenecks are with regards to what is otherwise a highly complex topic. We must strive to have at least a basic map of the terrain, in other words, even if there are a lot of uncharted areas.I’m not much of a programmer (the last time I wrote any code at all was probably around 2014), so any views I have on it are more from the engineering hardware side or from an economics angle, rather than talking about anything software specific. And what I’m mainly going to be trying to do is to figure out some of the right questions to think about, and to start mapping out some of the terrain to see where the bottlenecks or inflection points might be.When we think of technological development, we often imagine a smooth exponential line upwards.In reality, technological development is mostly a series of overlapping step-changes. Certain technological breakthroughs occur, cause a multi-decade technological , and then run into a hard ceiling and , until the next breakthrough emerges. That’s why there are often science fiction stories set at a certain date and by the time we actually reach that date, our world isn’t as advanced as the writer expected (e.g. the 1968 book  was set in 1992, and its 1982 film adaptation  was set in 2019).The reason this is relevant is because without the emergence of a new breakthrough, technology within a given industry often underperforms our expectations (if we assume a continuous growth model). In contrast, when there is a new breakthrough, technology within a given industry can easily outperform our expectations and change things more quickly than we expect.Often, the discovery and application of a more concentrated energy source serves as a big step-change. The invention of the steam engine and the associated mining of coal ushered in the industrial revolution, which then was compounded by the invention of the internal combustion engine and the associated production of oil. This gave humanity enough energy density for high-speed travel, broadly available running water, and the mechanization of agriculture. All of these things freed up most people to leave subsistence farming and to work on other things, and to have more sanitary living conditions, which led to a boom in industrial productivity and lifespans.In other words, a large portion of what we attribute to technology, is encapsulated in this chart:In the medical industry, the discovery of germs and the associated invention of antibacterial medicine, the invention of anesthesia and various surgical techniques, and the invention of vaccines against diseases like Polio massively increased survivability into old age during the early 20th century. Eventually our capabilities kind of stagnated, as we haven’t really increased the maximum human lifespan but have increased the percentage of people that make it into their 70s and older. One day, perhaps gene editing and various age-reversing technologies will create another big step-change toward much longer maximum lifespans.Humans spent thousands of years wanting to fly without much progress at all. In the 1700s, inventors made the hot air balloon, followed by hydrogen/helium airships, and then stagnated for a while at that level. But then, the combination of hydrocarbon production and aluminum production (both which began at commercial scale in the 1800s) finally allowed humans to create a true flying machine in the form of an airplane at the start of the 1900s. Due to the technological boom that ensued from that, just decades later we had safe commercial transcontinental flights and human space exploration. But then the technology ran into a practical ceiling and development slowed down, with an inability to maintain affordable supersonic commercial flight (e.g. the discontinuation of the ), and an inability to maintain the prior pace of human space exploration. The only period where humans traveled beyond low Earth orbit was in a brief window between 1968 and 1972, and now over five decades later, no human has traveled beyond low Earth orbit since that last time in 1972. And think for a moment about the fact that a civilian had the option to board a supersonic aircraft in the 1980s but has no option to do so today in the 2020s.The discovery of electricity and the application of it, along with telecommunication systems, was another massive source of innovation which further automated our surroundings and connected the whole world together. This also had a big impact on money: the telegraph enabled transactions to move around the world at the speed of light, which eventually played a role in changing the type of money we use all around the world. The invention of semiconductors then compounded this, giving us science-fiction level abilities to communicate with each other peer-to-peer through air, using supercomputers that we keep in our pockets. Rather than rely on buttons, nearly the entire surface of each of these pocket supercomputers serves as a controllable glass window into a globally-connected digital realm. Imagine describing this technology to your great-grandparents.Artificial intelligence has been with us for a while since the mid-20th century. And for over two decades, chess programs have been able to beat the best human chess players. At first it required a large supercomputer to beat top human grandmasters, but as technology improved, it could be done by a normal desktop computer, and now can be done by a mobile phone. The field of machine learning has continued to advance, with pockets of commercial relevance but nothing groundbreaking up until recently.Now, AI seems to have finally hit broad commercial relevance, conceptually equivalent to when engineers put hydrocarbons and aluminum together and opened up all sorts of new possibilities for flight in a stepwise fashion. Specifically, computers and software have reached a tipping point where we can apply AI to all sorts of different software tasks, and it can learn and adjust quickly to substantially impact how we work. It’s a step-change, not a gradual year-by-year compounding.The knee-jerk reaction to AI by investors is to invest in things that are needed to make AI, such as the AI software and the chips that they use. That trade is already rather crowded at this point.Another theme to think about is to ask, “what products will become 10x more accessible thanks to AI?”Let’s use Adobe () as an example. Photoshop is a semi-advanced program, in that it’s not exactly rocket science to use it, but it does take a considerable amount of time to learn to use it well. that I originally retweeted back in May shows how Adobe Photoshop is incorporating generative AI so that the user can easily make dramatic changes in seconds with basic text-based commands. The production of art, movies, software code, engineered designs, and all sorts of complex things are made more efficient by programs that can do many of the tedious and intricate underlying details of the work for the creator.In addition to making each Photoshop user more productive and powerful (i.e. they can get a lot more done per unit of time), it lowers the barrier of entry for using Photoshop. Just like how computers used to be difficult to use but became easier over time, all sorts of creator applications that have historically been moderately difficult should become way easier.The pessimistic case is that this type of creator AI assistance will put a large percentage of creators out of work because each creator can do the work of what several creators used to do. However, that assumes that the baseline amount of work to be done won’t change much. The optimistic case is that by broadening access to this type of work, it will dramatically grow the overall usage and demand for creator applications. In other words, a similar or larger number of creators can do an order of magnitude more creation work, rather than the same amount of creation work being done by an order of magnitude fewer creators.This might be directionally similar to how, by making the cost per megabyte of data storage exponentially less expensive over the past few decades, we began using 1000x or even 1,000,000x as much storage.Imagine being able to pick up any creator application (art, video, music, programming, 3D printing, engineering software, and so forth) and through verbal or written commands, intuitively use it to make what you want with most of the annoying details abstracted away. This dramatically lowers the barrier of entry and enables the companies that make those creator applications to sell far more subscriptions to far more users. There will still be more experienced users than others, but the overall pie of who can effectively use advanced creator software at a productive level can go up dramatically.I originally made this point in my May 28th  report. At that time, Adobe hadn’t really gained in price much while NVIDIA () had already soared in price, and so I recommended Adobe as a preferable investment within the AI trend from a risk/reward perspective. As of this writing, Adobe has now soared in price as well, and much more quickly than the broader Nasdaq 100, so I no longer view it as being at a great entry point. However, I think the overall theme of greatly expanding the accessibility of creators is one to be aware of, and I’d be interested in adding to Adobe on corrections.I think a longer-term trend worth taking seriously is how AI can help pharmaceutical and biotech companies. One of the clearest applications for AI is molecule simulation. In many ways, developing new pharmaceuticals is a matter of rapid guesswork and iteration, and AI can do that way faster and less expensively than humans in labs. AI in the years ahead should therefore substantially lower the costs of new drug creation and allow drugs to come to market more quickly. Whether through new drugs or gene manipulation, if there’s a technology that can accelerate our ability to cure most types of cancers, it’s AI.The dark side of empowering creators, and bio-engineers in particular, is that AI could, for example, dramatically lower the cost to engineer a deadly new virus. I’m less worried about AI overlords taking over the world than I am about what happens when it costs 1/1000th of what it currently does for rogue human groups to create new bioweapons.In addition to asking the question, “what will benefit from AI?” we need to ask “what will be disrupted by AI?” By process of elimination, this can lead us to a set of investments that, while they might not benefit greatly from AI, at least won’t be heavily disrupted by it. They will continue to provide good risk-adjusted returns when purchased at low valuations.AI has the capacity to disrupt all sorts of legacy-white collar businesses and repetitive tasks. Administrative overhead within organizations can be greatly streamlined. Their profit margin is AI’s opportunity to eat.Unless or until AI helps us solve some foundational physics problems to give us a world full of fusion reactors and nano-machines, however, it’ll likely to be slower to affect the physical world than the digital world. What I mostly mean by this is that the production and distribution of energy and materials remains a key limitation.Within say a ten-year time horizon, AI has all sorts of capacities to change how we interact with digital systems, but is unlikely to change energy and materials markets much, other than giving us small or moderate efficiencies around the margins (e.g. better software applications for finding resource deposits, better and faster designs for equipment, and cutting down on administrative overhead costs for energy/materials corporations).To put it another way, the field of robotics isn’t easy, especially outside of a highly-controlled manufacturing facility. Robots are complex, energy-intensive, materials-intensive, and maintenance-intensive. As a simple example, robot vacuums were invented decades ago but still aren’t ubiquitous, because they still have all sorts of . Other types of robots are 5x or 10x more complex than that and thus have greater constraints when it comes to totally replacing humans. To put it tangibly, we’re a long way off until a robot can reliably drive to my house and fix my HVAC system.People have historically overestimated the speed of hardware development (supersonic planes, flying cars, robot assistants) and have underestimated the speed of software development. I suspect the same trend will continue over the next decade; software and electronics will absolutely astound us in the years ahead, and yet our physical world will remain remarkably similar to how it is now with only minor changes. I would adjust this base expectation only if I saw some major physics breakthroughs that start to suggest otherwise.When humans write software programs, those programs are understood by the relevant people. But with machine learning and iteration, that’s not necessarily the case; software can become so complex that no human really knows what’s going on.AI can write code now, including for making new AI. In other words, a virtuous feedback loop can form, without humans in the loop. It’s not difficult to imagine that years or decades from now, this could get… weird.Right now, at any given time, tons of hackers are trying to breach various software systems that we rely on, and some small percentage of them succeed, which results in a lot of data breaches and other issues. Now, imagine that a group of hackers or a government agency makes an AI that is optimized for hacking. In other words, some AI programs are optimized for beating humans in chess, and some AI programs can be optimized for hacking into systems better than humans can.Early chess AI learned from games between grandmaster human players, and then could beat those grandmasters every time. Recent chess AI instead , and then could beat those other AIs at chess.Now, suppose that a similar approach is used for hacking. In fact I would be surprised if multiple groups were not already working on this. So, first AI learns how to hack from absorbing existing techniques, and then graduates to learning how to hack from just iterating over and over at superhuman speed and rewriting its code to get better and better. Eventually it becomes orders of magnitude better at hacking than any human, and can breach any system that humans have designed. This could be open-sourced and broadly available.So what’s the defense against that? For systems that are connected to the internet and have a lot of complexity (and thus can’t realistically be made “unhackable” as some offline or basic systems can), the answer is more AI. Similar to how the only rivals to chess programs at chess are other chess programs, we’ll probably reach a point where the only defenses against AIs optimized for hacking are AIs optimized to update and defend software systems against being hacked.Imagine a world where superhuman hackers are always and everywhere trying to breach everything, and superhuman defenders are always and everywhere trying to prevent those breaches from happening. And both the attackers and defenders are constantly iterating and updating themselves as they learn from each other, while no human really knows what’s going on because the code is more complex than they can understand and is updated more quickly than they can keep up with.In that scenario, digital gods will be constantly battling each other in cyberspace in ways we can’t even comprehend, and yet the systems we all rely on are what’s at stake in that battle.For decades, the combination of offshoring and automation of manufacturing has pushed the cost of goods down. Shoes, textiles, electronics, plastic goods, and similar items have decreased dramatically in price compared to most other things. Price inflation has primarily been limited to services, which could not be as easily automated, and to energy-intensive assets in general.For example, a television is cheaper today than a television of similar size and resolution 20 years ago, even though the supply of currency increased substantially. Televisions became cheaper even faster than the currency was debased. Similarly, with the number of transistors per processor doubling every two years (as per Moore’s law), nothing short of nearly 50% annual money supply growth would prevent the cost per transistor from reducing over time.AI over the coming years and decades is likely to give us a lot of price disinflation in services. AI can eventually allow one accountant to do the work of several accountants, one executive assistant to do the work of several executive assistants, one graphic designer to do the work of several graphic designers, one programmer to do the work of several programmers, and so forth. It’s hard to predict how fast and widespread the impact will be, but that’s clearly the direction.We should have greater abundance ahead, in terms of creating things efficiently and running a business efficiently.The problem, however, is that the growth of money supply is likely to remain significant. Debt-to-GDP and Debt-to-Money-Supply ratios remain very high. With the way the debt-based global financial system is currently structured, it’s hard to sustain the current levels of government, corporate, and household debt without greater amounts of broad and base money.From the start of 2000 to the end of 2022, we can see a significant divergence in asset and consumer prices. The gold price increased by 8.3% per year. The broad money supply per capita grew at 6.8% per year. The price of hospital services grew by 5.3% per year. The oil price grew at 4.7% per year. The median house price grew by 4.7% per year. Childcare prices grew by 4.2% per year. Average hourly wages earnings for non-supervisory production workers went up by 3.2% per year. Official consumer price inflation averaged 2.6% per year. The average bank account had a yield of less than 2% per year. Apparel was flat in price. Electronics, plastic toys, and software of all sorts dropped in price.This chart shows the official price growth of most of those items, normalized to the start of the year 2000:-Truly scarce things like fine art, gold, and waterfront properties (not shown on the chart) kept up with the growth of broad money supply, and surpassed official consumer price inflation by a wide margin.-Semi-scarce things we don’t know how to easily make more of such as hospital services, and childcare services, and oil, and grass-fed beef, and the median house went up a bit slower than the rate of broad money creation, but still above the rate of average consumer price inflation.-The official consumer price inflation number was weighed down by all sorts of deflationary items that were assisted by exponential technology that makes them nearly costless to produce.Plus, the consumer price index is inherently a recursive function. If the price of ribeye steak goes up and consumers shift to lower cost ground beef in response, then the basket of goods that the consumer price index is calculated from adjusts down to that new baseline. If ground beef gets too expensive and consumers shift to lower-cost poultry, then the basket of goods will be adjusted again. If poultry gets too expensive and consumers shift toward more rice and beans, then the basket of goods will be adjusted again. If butter from grass-fed cows gets too expensive and people shift toward industrially-produced soybean oil, then the basket of goods adjusts to that. Thus, highly-priced goods and services tend to filter themselves out of the basket, and low-priced goods and services tend to be emphasized.AI may exacerbate this trend. AI can make several types of services cheaper and more abundant to us, while still not really changing the scarcity of certain goods and services. We continue to need to visualize inflation as a spectrum, spread across multiple different categories.-If someone wishes to buy finite things like prime real estate, fine art, or the leading tech monopoly stocks, their income and net worth better keep up with the growth of broad money supply.-If someone wishes to own the median house, with a good healthcare plan and retirement savings, along with nutritionally-dense food and plenty of energy abundance, their income and net worth better surpass official CPI, even if it falls a bit short of broad money supply growth.-If someone wishes to just get by, living in multifamily housing or with their relatives, with their time spent mainly in the virtual world with cheap mass-produced processed food and with cheap mass-produced consumer goods, then they can get by with less growth of income and net worth, in line with official CPI or lower.I think it’s worth spending a bit of extra time on this theme. It’s not necessarily the biggest theme of the six but it’s one that I’ve spent a considerable amount of time looking into due to my prior work and research within the Bitcoin ecosystem and adjacent ecosystems.Which money is the best form of money for AI agents to use? From what I’ve seen so far, I think bitcoin is the leading answer.In a future world with a lot of human-to-machine, machine-to-human, and machine-to-machine payments, open-source digitally-native money is inherently suitable. I wrote about this topic in my August 2022 article on the Lightning Network, after previously discussing it with Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs:And then more recently in my May 28th Stock Waves report, I highlighted this example:That trend ended up having legs to it. At the end of June, the bitcoin-related companies Fedi and Stak teamed up to organize an AI hackathon, which ran through the month of July:In early July, Lightning Labs (a major Lightning Network infrastructure provider) announced a new set of developer tools to support this emerging bitcoin+AI intersection:The  focused a lot on the bitcoin+AI intersection and discussed the previously mentioned hackathon winners as well.In plain English, Lightning Labs tools are 1) making it easier to build AI agents that can hold and spend bitcoin as part of completing their tasks, and 2) making it easier to pay for resource-intensive computation on a per-use basis using the Lightning Network and the longstanding “HTTP 402 Payment Required” status code.To see the latter in action, you can watch , which was shared by Lightning Labs’ CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun. In the video, the user (Kody Low) has GPT-4 write code for him, and pays GPT-4 on a per-question basis (about $0.01 per question) using Lightning. The code he is asking the AI to write is ironically the very thing he is already demonstrating as a working service: the ability to pay for API calls with Lightning.More specifically, Kody asked the AI: “” He then paid the Lightning invoice. The AI understood the request, received the payment, and provided well-organized and well-commented code to answer the question. Kody then asked it to rewrite the code using the rust programming language rather than golang, and paid it again. The AI rewrote the code, and this time also gave more detail in English about what certain parts of the code are doing, and clarified that for a fully-implemented version it’ll need to incorporate more extensive error case handling and other nuances, but that this is the basic outline of the program. Kody then thanked it and said AI and Lightning go great together, and paid it again. The AI said that Kody is welcome, and agreed that both AI and Lightning are powerful technologies that work well together to create cutting-edge solutions.I’ve personally tested one of these programs, where I could access ChatGPT on my phone without using my subscription and pay the equivalent of a penny or two in Lightning with one button press to ask a question, and the pricing would fluctuate dynamically per question, presumably depending on some supply/demand algorithm running in the background.For fun, I asked ChatGPT for some examples where an AI agent might need to pay humans for things as part of completing its assigned tasks. Here was its response:I then asked it for some examples where an AI agent might need to pay another AI agent as part of completing its assigned tasks, and it answered:Now, the right skeptical question a reader of this part of this piece should ask is, “why pay in Lightning for AI usage, rather than just pay in dollars?” The answer is that Bitcoin/Lightning is uniquely well-suited to working with AI for a few reasons: Unlike many software applications, AI is very hardware intensive on a per-usage basis. When you use AI, you are using very electricity-intensive GPU hardware. The software itself is cheap once it’s developed, but each usage of that software has a substantial real-world electricity/hardware resource cost, unlike most types of software. If an API is left open to be paid via conventional means (e.g. credit cards), then the merchant opens itself up as a target for fraud. A user could spam the GPUs with thousands of users, and then perform chargebacks on their payments. In that event, the merchant bore the cost of the electricity/hardware but then lost the payments. Lightning on the other hand is a method of bearer asset final settlement.Most payment methods have limits in terms of how small individual transactions can be. You can’t pay $0.03 with a Visa card, for example. PayPal has merchant-side minimum fixed fees of $0.49 per transaction. The closest you can do is pre-fund an account and then pay micro-payments per usage within their ledger. And this all gets more complicated globally and across borders and currencies; if someone in Malaysia wants to pay someone in California for some AI usage, what payment method should they use? Even within my subscription payment backend on my website, my operations manager and I sometimes have issues accepting foreign credit cards, and in many countries they use mobile pay services rather than credit cards anyway. Lightning can handle microtransactions globally. A user can pay a few cents per usage from anywhere to anywhere, without subscriptions and without pre-funding. And this is highly relevant for machine-to-machine payments, where subscriptions may not be ideal and they just need to interact with each other on a real-time basis. AI agents can be spun up to do all sorts of things. As an entity with no legal identity, it is easier for an AI agent to hold and use open-source programmable money than for them to use a bank account or bank payment product. An AI agent might not be able to get a bank account, but they can run a Lightning node, or operate a Lightning wallet. And the programmable nature of Lightning, along with its real-time instant aspect, allows for dynamic pricing. In other words, the price per API call can be programmed to vary from second to second depending on how many incoming API requests they are getting at the same time.Now that artificial intelligence is making the creation of pictures, videos, texts, programs, and other things almost costless, it’s becoming harder to know which content is genuine compared to which content is a high-quality fake video or personality. When we see a picture or a video that might be important from a corporate, social, political, or geopolitical perspective, how can we know that it is actual footage rather than an AI-generated digital forgery? Now imagine what this will be like in five or ten years as the technology improves.And perhaps more concerning is the convincingness of bots. Whenever I use Twitter (now known as “X”), my posts get flooded with bots. Luckily, they are low-quality, badly-programmed obvious bots. However, there are also human impersonators that manually spin up an account that resembles mine, and begin trying to phish people for scams. What if we get to a point where AI bots on social media are actually quite convincing? And what if they can exist in uncountably high numbers, constantly being created as fast as they can be identified and blocked?In addition to spamming people with bots as a form of fraud, a sophisticated bot strategy might involve building an entire fake community to promote some idea and make it seem popular. Tons of different artificial personalities might be able to operate online, and be convincing to many people. Imagine a scenario where someone writes a program that creates an army of bots, each one unique and each one several years more advanced than current ChatGPT, and they coordinate to promote some political candidate, some social idea, or otherwise to just boost the perceived audience of some influencer. And now imagine that this program is open-sourced and exists for anyone that wants to use it. Pandora’s Box is opened.Imagine interacting online at a time when 1) the majority of human-seeming entities operating online are not human and 2) it’s very hard to determine which ones actually are human. That’s a weird environment to navigate.One way to handle that is for social media platforms to enforce an identity check during sign-up. In this context, new entrants will need to provide considerable evidence that they are a real person. Elon Musk’s Twitter/X seems to be moving in that direction, as have some other platforms. While that might indeed work for certain platforms, the obvious downside of this approach is that anonymity is an important part of safety and truth in many cases. People with certain professions that can’t comfortably be themselves online use anonymous accounts to relax on. More gravely, in many countries certain types of speech are illegal. Leaders can’t openly be criticized, certain topics are illegal to talk about, and so forth. In fact, several of the founding fathers of the United States originally used pseudonyms for protection when publishing their pre-revolution critiques of the U.K. monarchy. Authoritarians  forced identity checks to participate in social media, and a rampant bot problem would give them a great excuse to implement them. And they can easily coerce various platforms to hand over the data to them.The other approach is that social media can remain open and anonymous, but some sort of proof-of-continuity or payment check can be used to prevent a flood of countless bots. Back in the 1990s, the cryptographer Adam Back invented proof-of-work in the form of Hashcash to defend against various types of spam or denial-of-service attacks. It was eventually used by Satoshi Nakamoto in the heart of the Bitcoin protocol, but hasn’t otherwise been widely implemented in social media or other parts of the internet.Bitcoin’s ledger has a practically unforgeable history to it. Energy is required to update the ledger with each block on the blockchain, and the full history of the ledger has a tremendous amount of energy encoded into it, which makes it very hard to forge. In addition to being useable as a monetary asset, the Bitcoin blockchain now exists as a sort of global open-source immutable time capsule, where arbitrary data (including documents, pictures, books, songs, or timestamps from other systems) can be inserted into it for a cost, and it’s provable that what was inserted into it hasn’t been altered since that date. No closed-source, opaque, and centralized server can replicate this feature.Could Bitcoin’s proof-of-work be used to secure other types of systems against spam, in line with what Adam Back originally created Hashcash for? There are some avenues that have been explored along those lines, which might become increasingly relevant in the years ahead. Bitcoin is currently used by  as both a posting incentive and as a form of spam control. Users have to pay a tiny amount of fractional bitcoin to post and can tip each other with fractional bitcoin. The problem with traditional payments like Visa is that they identify the person, whereas bitcoin is proof-of-payment but doesn’t require the identity to be known, which is fine for spam prevention. This could be tailored in various ways. If Twitter/X were to implement a similar feature, then maybe for example I could have a setting that allows only people who have some type of micro-cost associated with their identity to comment on my posts, in order to prevent spam. Someone can create a public/private key pair (), but then go a step further and embed the public key into the Bitcoin blockchain with a real-world resource cost due to transaction fees, verify to people in various ways that this key is indeed theirs, and use their private key that goes along with that public key to sign any digital content that they create or authorize. The same can be true for any large journalist organization with known integrity standards. Platforms could check to see which key pairs are embedded or not. From that point on, this allows people to differentiate forgeries from genuine content (at least to the extent that it was created by that individual or organization and hasn’t been altered since publication, not necessarily that it’s objectively true), and it makes it so that a million impersonators cannot use similar key pairs that have been embedded, with real-world expense, into the Bitcoin blockchain.Although we’re not quite at the stage yet, in a world of sufficiently advanced artificial intelligence and virtually costless impersonation or forgeries, we might learn to demand proof-of-continuity (cryptographic public/private key pairs) and proof-of-work (evidence that real-world resources were expended to add weight to a given public/private key pair or online identity), before taking certain types of digital content seriously.In that potential future world that I previously described where 1) the majority of human-seeming entities operating online are not human and 2) it’s very hard to determine which ones actually are human, then we would need to adapt various way to sort out which entities have some sort of real-world tangibility or cost associated with them, to find signal through the near-infinite ocean of noise. Identity checks or the usage of a real-world resource cost are the two main directions that platforms can take to deal with that.I share model portfolios and exclusive analysis on .

"Energy Transfer: Despite Big Risks, Tempting +9.0% Yield","If you are an income-focused investor, Energy Transfer () offers a tempting 9.6% yield. Especially considering the stable fee-based income, the healthy distribution coverage ratio and the ongoing volume growth trajectory. However, there are variety of bigEnergy Transfer () owns and operates nearly 125,000 milesThe oil and natural gas products that move through the company’s pipelines are an integral part of modern life in ways many people don’t think about (for example, oil and natural gas are critical inputs in producing the clothes you wear, the food you eat and the transportation you use). And for perspective, Energy Transfer transports approximately 30% of all U.S. natural gas produced, 35% of all U.S. crude oil produced and exports more NGLs (natural gas liquids) than any other company or country (approximately 20% of the world market).Energy Transfer divides itself into five operating segments, including Natural Gas, Crude Oil, NGL & Refined Products, Intrastate & Interstate and SUN/USAC/Other (as you can see in the chart below).And in addition to Energy Transfer’s core segments, according to the company’s :If you like big income, then Energy Transfer is hard to ignore for multiple reasons. For starters, the company continues on a strong trajectory of growth:: Energy Transfer just recently  an incremental increase to its quarterly cash distribution (to $0.31 per common unit from the previous $0.3075), as you can see in the chart below.: And the distribution increase is supported by record operating volumes across several segments, as per the company’s most recently  results, including:: Acquisitions have been another source of growth for the company. For example, in May, Energy Transfer completed its acquisition of Lotus Midstream (for total consideration of $930 million in cash and approximately 44.5 million newly issued common units) and thereby opportunistically adding to ET’s Permian pipeline network. Further, just this month Energy Transfer  a deal to purchase Crestwood Equity Partners in a $7.1 billion deal.: Further still, as per the latest earnings release, Energy Transfer continues to “target a 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate, while… maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest in our incredible backlog of growth opportunities.”: Importantly, ET’s distribution is supported by stable fee-based earnings. Specifically, approximately 90% of the company’s EBITDA is fee-based, which means it can be significantly less volatile than the income of other energy sector companies that are more dependent on highly-volatile energy prices for earnings.: According to the company, ""Energy Transfer LP’s Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the Plan) is available to all owners of Energy Transfer LP common units and is an excellent way for ET owners to reinvest their distributions.” Noteworthy, “Common units purchased through the Plan will be sold at a discount ranging from 0% to 5% (currently set at 0.0%) and investors will not pay any service fees, brokerage trading fees or other charges.”Despite all of the attractive qualities of Energy Transfer’s big distribution, there are also a wide variety of risk factors that investors need to consider.: As you can see in the following chart, Energy Transfer’s debt load grew significantly over the last decade.The debt was used to fund growth, but it also create risks. Bringing down the debt has been a stated goal of management. Here is what Co-CEO Tom Long had to say about it on the last :Energy Transfer continues to maintain an investment grade credit rating from all three of the major rating agencies.Also noteworthy, Energy Transfer has a variety of preferred units outstanding. Preferred units are often considered a stock-bond hybrid, whereby they can offer some healthy distribution income and lower volatility. Preferred units generally don’t have the same price appreciation potential as common units, and they are also ahead of common units in the capital structure (meaning in a default situation, preferred investors could get some money back when common units are totally wiped out).: As a Master Limited Partnership, Energy Transfer brings tax-related challenges for some investors, including the receipt of a K-1 statement at tax time. Here is what the company has to say about that on its website:Further still, some midstream companies have been abandoning the K-1 structure, in some cases creating significant one-time tax pain for investors (for example the recent ONEOK () Magellan Midstream () ).: higher interest rates also creates a risk for debt-heavy businesses, such as Energy Transfer, because as rates rise so does the cost of borrowing (which could put additional stress on the business. Fortunately, as you can see in the table below, some of the impact and challenges of higher rates is dispersed through a laddered bond maturity structure as you can see in the following table.: Some investors argue that Energy Transfer’s founder and current Executive Chairman, Kelcy Warren, lacks financial discipline thereby introducing significant risk for the company. For example,  by Samuel Smith explains what he calls ""The Kelcy Warren Discount,"" whereby he explains:For a little background, after founding the company in 1996, Mr. Warren grew it from a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator to the massive organization it is today. However, he took on a lot of risk to do it, and he is part of the reason the company’s current debt level is viewed as high by many investors.However, Warren still own a significant portion of Energy Transfer (see table below), and is thereby incentivized to care about its continued success and viability. In fact, Kelcy  in Energy Transfer units just last week.Further, approximately 13% of the company is owned by insiders. Important to note, Kelcy Warren has unique voting rights that cannot easily be diluted below 20%, as described in the company’s .Important to note, in 2020 Energy Transfer  new co-CEOs, arguably thereby adding some much needed additional discipline to the operations of the organization.: According to Morningstar, Energy Transfer’s business lacks any significant “moat.” As per sector strategist, Stephen Ellis:: Regulations and environmental considerations pose another risk the company has to deal with. For example, in 2022 Energy Transfer  with environmental crimes related to the Revolution natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania (after a portion of the pipeline failed after heavy rains). Additionally, the US Department of Energy recently threw a wrench into Energy Transfer’s Lake Charles LNG export project in Louisiana by  the company’s rehearing request. Further still, Energy Transfer continues to face costly regulatory challenges with regards to the Dakota Access Pipeline.All three of the above examples show the company's plans can be impacted significantly (and even halted altogether) by environmental and regulatory concerns (thereby negatively impacting growth and ultimately valuation).Energy Transfer units are relatively inexpensive as compared to peers (such as Enterprise Products Partners ()) on an EV/EBITDA basis, as you can see in the following chart.Arguably, Energy Transfer is assigned a lower valuation because of the high risks (such as those described in the previous section). However, considering the company has addressed most of the risks (by improving debt/leverage ratios and installing discipline through the new co-CEOs) Energy Transfer units are undervalued. In fact, most Wall Street Analysts have a “Strong Buy” rating on Energy Transfer, as you can see in the following graphic.Morningstar sector strategist Stephen Ellis (mentioned earlier) recently upgraded his price target (following the most recent quarterly earnings release in early August) to $17.50, thereby suggesting Energy Transfer has 27% upside (and that is in addition to the big distribution yield).We have ranked Energy Transfer at #9 in our new report: . And if you can handle the K-1 at tax time, it's absolutely worth considering (especially within the constructs of a prudently diversified portfolio--to help offset the bouts of idiosyncratic volatility the midstream industry occasionally suffers). More specifically, Energy Transfer has been working to address the big risk factors (as described in this report) and is now undervalued, especially considering the very large distribution yield.Further, to help offset some of the partnership-specific risks, you might consider owning Energy Transfer within the constructs of a prudently-diversified portfolio, such as the 27 top ideas in our  portfolio.

"TORM plc: Record Earnings, 15%-21% Yield, Very Undervalued","With energy prices continuing to rise, and major displacement causing much longer ton miles, shipping vessel rates have remained far above 2021 rates, which has benefited fleets which focus on the spot market. One such vessel company is TORM plc (TORM is present in all large vessel classes in the product tanker market, with specific focus on the LR2- Long Range 2, LR1 - Long Range 1, and MR - Medium Range vessel classes as these three segments offer the greatest synergies.This rise in spot rates has enabled TRMD to begin paying very generous dividends.During January 2023, TORM acquired seven 2011-2013 built LR1 vessels. In March 2023 additionally three MR vessels were acquired in a partly cash-based and partly share based transaction.TRMD shares are listed on the Nasdaq in New York and Copenhagen. Oaktree owns 65% of the shares, vs. 20% for retail shareholders:Product tanker fleet utilization has reached a level where small changes in utilization lead to large changes in freight rates.There has been strong growth in Europe's middle distillate imports from the Middle East/Asia/US as a result of the EU sanctions against Russia which came into effect in February 2023. Changes in refinery landscape with closures in importing regions (e.g. Australia, New Zealand) and capacity additions in exporting regions (Middle East, China), also have supported higher rates.In addition, world fleet growth remains low, with a low volume order book with the earliest delivery date at renowned yards in 2026, which means that fleet growth in 2023-2025 remains limited. leading to higher utilization.2022: This was a record year for TRMD, with three-digit topline growth and four-digit earnings and cash flow growth, as rates soared above those of 2021, rising ~3X vs. 2021.Q2 '23: Management reported ""the strongest second quarter in our history, a quarter that continues the performance from the first quarter of this year. We realized a TCE of $308 million in the second quarter and an EBITDA result of $237 million. Adjusted for unrealized gains on FFA contracts of $37 million, our EBITDA result increased 23% to $199 million while profit before tax increased 72% to $184 million compared to the same period last year."" Q1-2 '23: TRMD continued its major growth, with revenue up 41%, and 3-digit gains in net income, EPS, operating cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA.Looking forward, management sees Q3 '23 TCE rates down ~20%, to ~$30.5K/day, vs. ~436K/day in Q2 '23. Also, 74% of the fleet is covered at that rate. However, looking forward to Q4 '23 and 2024, TCE rates are expected to strengthen to ~$41K/day, which bodes well for continued high dividend payments over the near term.At its 10/20/23 closing price of $28.71, TRMD has a forward dividend yield of nearly 21%, based upon its most recent quarterly payout of $1.50/share in August.At 20% lower TCE rates in Q3 '23, the dividend may decrease to ~$1.20/share, which is still a nearly 17% yield. If they drop by 30%, there may be a $1.05/share dividend, which would equal a nearly 15% yield. Countering the lower TCE rates are TRMD's higher fleet days due to its vessels acquired in 2023.TRMD should declare the next quarterly dividend on ~11/10/23, with an ~11/22/23 ex-dividend date, and a ~12/8/23 pay date.TRMD's current dividend run began in Q1 '22, at $.58, and going as high as $2.59 for Q4 '22, and to $1.50 for Q2 '23. Dividend coverage was a healthy 1.43X, and has averaged 1.33X over the past four quarters.That EPS figure even includes non-cash depreciation and amortization, of which there was ~$.83/share in Q1-2 '23, which is quite a cushion.TORM is based in the UK, which has a reciprocal tax treaty with the US.Not surprisingly, TRMD's gross profit, margins, ROE, ROC, and ROA are all impressively much higher than marine shipping averages. It has earned high ratings for these metrics, ranging from B+ to A+, from Seeking Alpha's sector relative grading system.TRMD's Interest coverage factor is very strong, at 14.98X, and gets a solid grade of B from SA's dividend safety grading system. In addition, it has much lower debt leverage than its sector, with net long-term debt/EBITDA leverage of just 59.18%, which is 32% lower than its sector's 87.31% average leverage::In Q2, TORM completed the refinancing of bank and leasing agreements for USD $480M and further secured a USD $73M facility that can be used for additional secondhand vessel financing.Since the announcement in March 2023, TORM has utilized USD $50M of the USD $123M that was originally committed for secondhand financing. As a result of the transaction, TRMD has outperformed its industry and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the past quarter and year. While it has lagged price wise so far in 2023, its total return is ~9.15%, while its one-year total return is more than 48%, due to its very high dividends and price gains, vs 17.08% for the S&P 500.TRMD's total return so far in 2023 is 26.86%, vs. 11.83% for the S&P 500:At its 10/20/23 closing price of $28.71, TRMD, is 14.5% below analysts' lowest price target of $33.60, and . Its trailing P/E, both GAAP and non-GAAP, are over 60% cheaper than the sector median valuations, as is its Forward non-GAAP P/E.Its trailing EV/EBITDA is also 39% lower, while its forward EV/EBITDA is 31.7% lower, with both metrics getting B+ ratings from the Seeking Alpha grading system. TRMD's Price/Book of 1.53X is ~10% cheaper than the 1.69X sector median.There appear to be varying valuations of TRMD's equity - TRMD's balance sheet shows it as $1,562M, a book value/share of $18.04, which results in a P/book of 1.55X.However, TRMD's vessels are also rated/valued by brokers each quarter, according to their age, condition, and earnings. Much higher rates have caused these vessel valuations to jump by ~43% in Q2 '23 vs. Q2 '22, which has led to TRMD's net asset value/share jumping from $18.50 to $29.80.The shipping industry is traditionally volatile due to changing economic conditions, which can affect shipping rates. Since TRMD concentrates on spot rates, a prolonged economic downturn would most likely affect the level of its dividends. Countering this would be the ageing of the world tanker fleet, leading to more scrapping of vessels, and long delivery times for new vessels.At $28.71, TRMD presents a compelling value - its trailing and forward P/E valuations are much lower than its industry's averages, and its dividend yield dwarfs that of its industry. Given the opportunity for continued attractive dividends in 2023 - 2024, we rate TRMD a buy up to $32.You can see more detail on TRMD's operations in its , and its ""This article was submitted as part of , which runs through October 25.

SLB Steps Up To New Environment,"Market capitalization of SLB Limited () (formerly Schlumberger), is $83.3 billion, up by 61% from $51.9 billion ago. The dividend yield is a minor 1.7% although the company alsoSLB just closed the OneSubsea joint venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea7.It benefits from global diversification, and is the largest oilfield services firm, an important factor as countries like Saudi Arabia look to allocate $100 billion for drilling in 2023-2025.Should SLB choose to re-enter the US onshore oilfield services market at scale in areas like pressure pumping it is more likely to do so in 2025 or later. Its strengths are in large, international, and offshore hydrocarbon projects.I own shares of SLB. I recommend its stock to energy investors interested in capitalEarlier this month SLB, Aker Solutions, and Subsea7  As the name suggests, the joint venture is oriented toward making subsea production more innovative and efficient. SLB owns 70% of OneSubsea, Aker Solutions owns 20%, and Subsea7 owns 10%.What this also means, is that, per the announcement, “OneSubsea now comprises SLB’s and Aker Solutions’ subsea businesses.”The joint venture will be headquartered (appropriately, jointly) in Oslo, Norway and Houston, Texas.In 2020—an unbelievably dire year financially for the energy sector--SLB sold its OneStim onshore pressure pumping business to Liberty Energy () in exchange for  of Liberty, over a third of Liberty’s equity. Early in , Liberty completed the buyback of all these shares, so SLB no longer has an equity interest in Liberty. However, under the terms of their 2020 Master Transaction Agreement SLB will not “engage in any business or enterprise that is competitive with OneStim within onshore United States and Canada” without the prior written consent of Liberty until after December 31, 2024.With no remaining equity interest in Liberty, SLB cannot nominate new members to Liberty’s board; however, its previous nominees,  are expected to remain on Liberty's board until their terms are complete or until Liberty’s Nominating and Governance Committee requests they resign.SLB’s  derived 78% from international operations and 22% from North America. In the second quarter, the company earned:*$8.1 billion of revenues, a 5% sequential increase and a  increase*$1.03 billion of net income ($0.72/share)*adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 billion at a 24.2% margin*pretax segment operating income of $1.58 billion at a 19.5% margin.SLB is organized by four operating divisions and four geographical regions. Operating divisions are 1) digital & integration, 2) reservoir performance, 3) well construction, and 4) production systems. The company’s second-quarter pretax operating income by division, with margin, is shown below.The importance of the European and the Middle East/Asian operations are illustrated in the graph of 2Q23 revenue by region.Discussing growth, in its  CEO Olivier Le Peuch noted that international revenue was 80% of the company’s global portfolio and offshore about half of that. He said, “In the international markets, the investment momentum of the past few years is accelerating. This is supported by resilient long-cycle development in Guyana, Brazil, Norway and Turkey; production capacity expansions in the Middle East, notably in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar; the return of exploration and appraisal across Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transition.”For example, Le Peuch also outlined expectations that between 2023 and 2025, Saudi Arabia would allocate nearly $100 billion to upstream oil and gas capital expenditure, a 60% increase from the previous three years, as they seek to reach maximum sustainable production capacity of 13 million BPD by 2027.A few factors in energy pricing:*Interest rate increases, or at least a lack of decreases, remain on the horizon for the next several months.*The anti-hydrocarbon Biden administration has limited the five-year US offshore leasing schedule to just three auctions, the least ever. This continues the Biden administration’s pattern of imposing limits on US drilling.*A factor likely to exacerbate US oil price moves is Biden administration sales of  barrels of oil of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a significant reduction. At full capacity, the US SPR holds just over  barrels, or about a month’s worth of US oil consumption at 20 million barrels per day (MMBPD) of consumption.*It is worth noting US' own oil production is now about 13 MMBPD, up from as little as 5 MMBPD in 2005 due to the increase from onshore US shale production in areas like the Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford.The October 10, 2023, Brent NYMEX oil futures price (for December 2023 delivery) was $87.72/barrel. On October 10, 2023, for November delivery:*West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price was $85.97/barrel,*Henry Hub (Louisiana) natural gas price was $3.38/MMBTU, and*Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) liquefied natural gas price was $15.39/MMBTU.Prior to the invasion of Israel by Hamas, the EIA’s 5-95 confidence interval for future oil prices was $40-$140/bbl by year-end 2024.SLB’s main US office is in , Texas; however, it is administratively headquartered in Paris, France and its 2Q23 conference call was scheduled on Greenwich Mean Time.SLB’s largest oilfield service competitors are Baker Hughes (), Halliburton (), and NOV Inc. (). As a leading oilfield services provider to national oil companies (NOCs), it also competes with Middle East/North Africa oilfield service company National Energy Services Reunited ().Smaller offshore oilfield services competitors are Weatherford (), Transocean (), and Tidewater ().As noted above, SLB’s agreement with Liberty Energy limits SLB from competing with the former OneStim business (mainly North American onshore pressure pumping) it sold to Liberty until after December 31, 2024.Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) ranks SLB’s overall governance on October 1, 2023, as a very good 2, with sub-scores of audit (5), board (3), shareholder rights (5), and compensation (2). On the ISS scale, 1 represents lower governance risk and 10 represents higher governance risk.Shorted shares were 1.5% of floated shares at September 15, 2023, and insiders own a tiny fraction (0.20%) of the outstanding stock.At 1.79, SLB’s beta is quite high given the company’s large size: its stock moves directionally with the overall market but with far more volatility. However, this reflects the large supply and demand uncertainties in the global oil services sector.At June 29, 2023, much of SLB’s stock was held by institutions, some of which represents index fund investments that match the overall market. The four largest institutional holders were Vanguard (9.1%), BlackRock (7.5%), State Street (5.9%), and Capital World (3.0%).BlackRock, State Street, and Capital World are signatories to the  a group that, as of June 30, 2023, manages  in assets worldwide and which (despite less energy supply due to reduced Russian exports to Europe) limits hydrocarbon investment via its commitment to achieve net zero alignment by 2050 At the October 10, 2023, closing price of $58.62/share, SLB’s market capitalization is $83.3 billion.The 52-week price range is $41.10-$62.12 per share, so the closing price is 94% of the 52-week high and 87% of the average one-year target of $67.61/share.Trailing twelve-months’ (TTM) earnings per share (EPS) is $2.73 for a current price/earnings ratio of 21. The average of analysts’ estimates for 2023 and 2024 EPS is $2.98 and $3.67 respectively, giving a forward price/earnings ratio range of 16.0 to 19.7.TTM EBITDA, cash flow, and levered free cash flow were $6.73 billion, $5.12 billion, and $1.52 billion respectively.TTM return on assets and equity were 7.1% and 22.5% respectively.At June 30, 2023, SLB had $25.9 billion in liabilities—of which $11.3 billion was long-term debt--and $44.8 billion in assets resulting in a liability-to-asset ratio of 58%. This is down (improved) from 61% a year ago.The company’s debt/EBITDA ratio is 2.0 and its debt/market capitalization is 0.16.SLB’s dividend of $1.00/share yields 1.7%. It  the quarterly dividend rate 40% in February 2023, although the rate is still half what it was in early 2020 ($2.00/share), before the energy market downturn.SLB has a share repurchase program and bought back $213 million (4.5 million shares) during 2Q23. In its 2Q23 investor call, SLB's chief financial officer, Stephane Biguet, said the company had committed to return $2 billion to shareholders in 2023 between dividends and buybacks. At the current dividend rate, this would be about $1.4 billion in dividends and $600 million in buybacks.Book value per share is $13.09, less than a quarter of the current market value per share.Mean analyst rating is a 2.1, or “buy,” from 37 analysts, with at least one analyst calling the stock fairly valued.However, the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA is 13.8, above the level of 10.0 or less that would suggest a bargain.SLB’s 3Q23 earnings call will be October 20, 2023.SLB’s major medium-term exposure is to changes in oil and natural gas prices and thus changes in worldwide drilling budgets.As an international operator, it has political risk in every country in which it operates, including the US.SLB’s dividend yield alone, excluding share repurchases or stock price appreciation, is not competitive with rates near or above 5% for 2-year Treasuries.Although the company has a share buyback program as well as a modest dividend, it is not recommended to dividend investors. Other companies are more generous.The company has a very good governance score, but the stock is not a bargain—near its 52-week high, a ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA of 13.8, and a forward price/earnings ratio of 16.0-19.7.However, SLB’s stock has seen good appreciation. It has steadily paid down debt. Its growth prospects are exciting, particularly as large capital expenditures shift from North America onshore to international offshore, SLB’s forte.And now, given the growing recognition of the  importance of hydrocarbons in the energy mix, I recommend SLB to growth investors interested in globally diversified, large-scale oilfield services.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Goehring & Rozencwajg Q2 2023 Natural Resource Market Commentary,"Picture it, if you will: December of 2029. In a dimly lit private dining room, the sound of cutlery clinking blends with spirited conversation. Gathered at this stately round table is a diverse group of investors. Some wear the hard-fought wrinkles of significant gains, while others wear the furrowed brows of regrettable losses. What stratagems, one wonders, divided the winners from the less fortunate?To call the 2020s volatile might be akin to calling the sun slightly warm. Consider 2020, with the globe in the clutches of COVID-19. Then there was the inflationary flare of 2022, a fire stoked by Russia’s move on Ukraine. Central banks, as reactive as ever, escalated rates in a dramatic fashion, prompting many to toast to the Federal Reserve’s apparent mid-2023 success. Alas, as the hypothetical scene suggests, the party might have been premature.The prevailing wisdom of 2023 still held that oil demand had seen its heyday in late 2019. How baffling, then, that by the end of the decade, demand kept reaching new unexpected highs, largely propelled by emerging markets like India. A trust in the boundless potential of the US oil shales was dashed, as production waned midway through our tumultuous decade. The American solution, releasing a sizable portion of its strategic reserves, was a mere temporary salve, and oil’s price ascended to dizzying heights. In a few short years, oil had gone from universally accepted as “uninvestable” to the “must-own” asset class.A brief upturn in food prices post the Russian-Ukraine conflict turned out to be just the opening act. The main event? A succession of agricultural calamities, the most severe being a midwest US drought, eerily reminiscent of the 1930s Dust Bowl.Renewable energy, hailed as the savior of both wallet and environment, took a rather ironic turn. With heavy government backing, these “clean” energies seemed to generate only escalated electricity costs and persistent power shortages, plaguing the very Western economies that championed them.The mighty dollar began the decade without peer. Yet, halfway through the 2020s, the musical chairs of global monetary order began, with nations gravitating towards their own currencies and the golden touch of precious metals to square off their imbalances.With the dollar’s retreat, the inflationary inferno pushed commodity demand significantly higher. Bonds were not spared, resulting in the central banks’ predictable rescue operation as governments had trouble rolling over their short-term obligations.Equity markets too grappled with inflation’s weight and the diminishing lure of bonds. A stark illustration: The Dow Jones Industrial Average’s () relationship with gold. From a once formidable 20:1 ratio at the decade’s onset, a historical crossroads loomed: ten years later, they looked set to cross – a rare event that had occurred only three times in 140 years (1896, 1932-4 and 1980).Retrospect at our 2029 table illuminated the follies and triumphs of a decade. Those that had bought the “must own” assets of the early 2020s (i.e., fixed income and growth stocks) were rewarded with the worst inflation-adjusted returns. Conversely, the assets most universally hated at the start of the 2020s (i.e., hard assets) produced the best returns by far. Leading that hard asset class would be the quintessential “hard” asset: gold.Those far-sighted souls who, a decade earlier, had the wisdom to acquire gold found themselves comfortably ensconced in the cozy realm of foresight. While much of the market grappled, rather inelegantly, with the unforeseen maladies of the decade — resulting in discernible, tangible losses in what were once deemed “safe” portfolios — these astute speculators sat on the very asset that the generalist hordes suddenly found irresistible. Come the twilight of the 2020s, they stood not just as benefactors of their own prudence but as the envy of many, having firmly secured the reins of their financial future.Peering into fog of the future, one is invariably met with a degree of uncertainty, a kind of myopia if you will. Yet, it might amuse our diligent readership that the unforeseen turns and tempests in today’s financial landscape were none other than the subjects dissected at our Fall 2022 Investor Day.Marko Papic candidly expounded on our trajectory: veering away from the quiet sanctity of a unipolar world to the cacophonous theaters of multipolarity. The aspiring occupant of the Oval Office, Vivek Ramaswamy, elucidated on the curious ways ESG pressures have begun to distort corporate investment, particularly when one treads the rugged terrains of natural resources.Leigh Goehring sounded the clarion call on a looming metamorphosis – our gas fields, both global and our own continental, teetering on the brink of a structural deficit. As for agriculture? Shaun Hackett painted a frosty panorama, hinting at the dawning of a global cooling epoch, replete with its tantrums of volatile weather and crop yields that greatly disapointed. Adam Rozencwajg warned of the faux allure of renewables, focusing on the paradoxical energy crisis it might birth, thanks to the nettlesome issue of their efficiency. Edward Chancellor, always the astute historian, regaled us with tales of investment cycles, drawing our gaze to the grand pendulum swings in energy and metals – a narrative of liquidation, but promising prosperity in its aftermath.Now, it’s true that at Goehring & Rozencwajg, our crystal ball isn’t infallible. Yet, it’s in our DNA to speculate, prognosticate, and occasionally, pontificate. An interesting tapestry woven by our speakers was a shared spirit of contrarianism, a thirst to not just see the future but to envision it with a tint different from the many.The golden thread for our attendees? A bullish outlook for several commodities. But ah! One precious element was not discussed: gold. The gilded metal, we assert, stands on the precipice of a roaring bull run, perhaps echoing its luminous days of the ‘70s and the 2000s. Despite its sluggish dance since the commodity rally began in May 2020, with gold’s mere 15% advance looking rather pale against the Rogers International Commodity Index’s 160% and the Goldman Sachs Spot Commodity Index’s 125% leap, we sense an imminent turn of the tides. Investors, it seems, might be getting one last golden ticket.Those with long memories might remember how gold became the “must-own” asset of the 1970s. We believe the same thing is happening today. Gold demand will come from speculators seeking a short-term profit and generalist investors seeking protection from financial turmoil and mounting inflationary pressures. Gold and silver were radically undervalued in 1971. Over the next decade, they were the best-performing asset class. Between 1970 and the peak in January 1980, gold and silver surged 2,000% and 2,800%, respectively.After peaking in 1980, gold spent the next 20 years drifting lower. By 1999, it had become as cheap as ever on many metrics. Between 1999 and today, gold advanced more than eight-fold, significantly outperforming stocks and bonds. Despite its strong appreciation, we believe gold remains exceptionally cheap based on our framework. In the following essay, we will describe our valuation techniques and show that gold still has a considerable upside, irrespective of what occurs in global financial markets.The question remains: Come 2029, on which side of the table do you envision yourself?Gold is no different than any other asset class: it becomes popular, rises in price, is overvalued, and ultimately represents a poor investment. Other times, it undergoes periods of investor disinterest, suffers sustained price declines, becomes undervalued, and ultimately represents an excellent investment.We are not gold bugs. Over the long term, gold protects monetary debasement; however, unlike equities, gold will provide little real return. If an investor can identify periods when gold becomes extremely undervalued, it can offer exceptional excess returns, often uncorrelated with other financial assets.The key is figuring out when gold is undervalued and overvalued.In this essay, we will describe the various valuation frameworks we have used over many years to estimate gold price targets and determine when to add or reduce our gold exposure.In May 2000, I was  and discussed gold’s radical undervaluation. I predicted gold would reach $2,500 per ounce before the bull market ended. When the article was published, gold was $275 per ounce, and continuous central bank selling had left investors wildly bearish towards the so-called “barbarous relic.” Our valuation framework pointed instead to substantial potential returns. Although gold never hit our $2,500 target, it reached $1,900 in 2011 and was the best-performing asset class of the 2000s.Gold has been in a bull market for nearly a generation, leaving many questioning if it still represents an attractive investment as in the late 1960s or 1990s.After bottoming at $251 per ounce in August 1999, gold surged to $1,900 in August 2011, pulled back to $1,050 by December 2015, and resumed its advance, making an all-time high triple-tops of $2,050 in August 2020, March 2022 and May 2023. However, gold is now as undervalued as in 1999 on several metrics.Potential gold investors must ask three questions. First, is gold undervalued today? Second, if gold is undervalued, to what degree? And finally, how high could it go were it to swing from undervalued to overvalued – something that has happened twice in 100 years?To help answer the first question, we compare the value of gold to both the money supply and the value of financial assets. We also find it helpful to consider the historical relationship between gold and other commodities.Below are three charts that highlight these relationships over the last 100 years. The first chart shows the relationship between the size of the US Treasury’s gold holdings and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Although somewhat controversial, we believe the size of the Fed’s balance is related to the dollar value of the Treasury’s gold holdings over the long term. According to this chart, there have been two distinct periods over the past 100 years during which gold was highly overvalued and three periods during which gold was significantly undervalued.In the late 1930s, President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 65%, raising the gold price to $35 per ounce. At the same time, clouds of war were gathering across Europe. The combination of a higher gold price in the US and growing hostilities in Europe led to a massive volume of gold inflows in America. At the peak, the dollar value of the Treasury’s gold holdings exceeded the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by an incredible 1.7 times. The gold flows into the US were so great that the Treasury could have exchanged every dollar bill in circulation for gold and retained half of its gold stock.The gold’s second period of overvaluation occurred in January 1980. Gold spiked in a parabolic blow-off to $850 per ounce in January 1980, following two decades of accelerating inflation. At the peak, the Treasury’s gold holdings (vastly diminished from the late-1930s levels) were once again valued at 1.7 times the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.Gold turned out to be a terrible investment after both periods of radical overvaluation. Between 1937 and 1971, gold was flat while the stock market advanced tenfold. Between 1980 and 2000, gold fell 70% while the stock market ran thirteen-fold.On the other hand, gold was radically undervalued three times. The first period occurred in the late 1960s. With gold fixed at $35 under the Bretton Wood’s Gold Exchange Standard and inflationary pressures mounting in the US, gold flowed out of the Treasury. By 1971, the Fed’s monetary base exceeded the Treasury’s gold holdings by seven times. The three-decade reversal was impressive: between 1938 and 1971, the Treasury’s gold holdings went from covering the Fed’s monetary base by 1.7 times to less than 15%.The second period of undervaluation occurred during the late 1990s. Following twenty years of falling gold prices and a rapid expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet, the size of the Fed’s monetary base exceeded the Treasury’s gold holdings by nine times. In other words, the dollar’s unofficial (and unconvertible) gold coverage reached an all-time low of 11%.As we saw, the periods of overvaluation (the 1930s and 1980) were great opportunities to sell gold. Conversely, the periods of undervaluation (1969 and 1999) were excellent buying opportunities. Gold was the best-performing asset class in the decade following each period of maximum undervaluation.Gold, relative to the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, is more undervalued today than in the late 1960s or 1990s. The reason: even though gold advanced over seven-fold over the last twenty-three years, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has grown even faster. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, global central banks have undertaken radical monetary policies.Since 2008, the Federal Reserve has undertaken four massive rounds of quantitative easing, resulting in a monetary base nine times larger than in 1999. The Fed printed money faster than gold appreciated over the last twenty-three years. The Fed’s monetary base currently stands at over nine times the Treasury’s gold holdings, compared with six times in 1969 and nine times in 1999 – the other two excellent buying opportunities. According to our analysis, gold is 30% more undervalued than in 1969 and on par with 1999.Valuing gold against financial assets tells a similar story. Chart 2 shows the relationship between gold and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over the last 100 years, there have been three periods during which gold was radically undervalued relative to financial assets.The first period occurred in the late 1920s. In response to a decade of rapid monetary growth in the US (related to Britain’s failed attempt to peg the pound to gold at the pre-World War I rate), the US stock market surged, driven mainly by speculation funded by borrowed money. From the 1921 lows, the Dow appreciated six-fold, hitting 380 in August 1929.With gold fixed at $20.65 per ounce, the Dow, by the fall of 1929, was equivalent to approximately eighteen ounces. In retrospect, the stock market was radically overvalued. Over the next four years, the Dow fell 90%, bottoming at 42. At the lows, the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold – an extreme reading that would not be repeated for fifty years.In January 1934, Roosevelt raised the gold price to $35 per ounce. The Dow and gold nearly reached parity in 1932; however, they missed each other by $7 per ounce and eighteen months. Between 1929 and 1934, the Dow fell 80% while gold rose 70%. From 1929 to 1935 gold radically outperformed global equity markets.The next time financial assets were radically overvalued relative to gold occurred in the late 1960s. The Dow first broke 1,000 in 1966 and then again in 1969 and 1971. With gold still fixed at $35 per ounce, the Dow was equivalent to twenty-eight ounces– a new record. The 1960s experienced long periods of excess money and credit creation, resulting in a speculative bull market again funded by debt. In retrospect, financial assets were overvalued. Between the late 1960s and 1980, the Dow fell by 25% while gold advanced twenty-four-fold. Finally, by 1980, the Dow and gold both hit 850.Gold entered a grinding bear market following its record overvaluation in 1980. On the other hand, financial assets spent the next two decades rallying. Following the 1929 episode, gold took fifty years to work off its overvaluation. Following the 1980 peak, gold only took twenty years to become cheap relative to financial assets. Between 1980 and 1999, gold fell by 68% from $850 to $253 per ounce, while the Dow advanced thirteen-fold from 850 to 11,000. A prudent investor ought to have been out of the gold market entirely.In 1999 the Dow surpassed 11,000 while gold had fallen to $253 per ounce. The Dow was equivalent to forty-three ounces of gold at those levels – an all-time record. Given these extreme levels, an investor ought to have expected a booming bull market in gold to develop. Indeed, that is what I expected when I made my investments and gave my interview to Forbes in 2000.We were handsomely rewarded. Between 1999 and 2011, gold surged seven-fold, becomingthe best-performing asset class of the decade. Global equities suffered two massive bear markets, ending the period where it started.Over the last decade, the stock market has again entered another huge bull market, leaving the Dow equivalent to 20 ounces of gold. The question is whether this represents under- or overvaluation. Financial bulls (i.e., gold bears) might highlight how the Dow has been equivalent to thirty ounces of gold in the late 1960s and forty ounces in the late 1990s. In this context, 20:1 does not appear radically undervalued. Perhaps the equity bull market will continue. Unfortunately, for equity markets, we firmly believe otherwise.Chart 3 gives us great confidence that today’s 20:1 ratio will end up being the cycle peak and that over the next several years, the Dow will be equivalent to fewer than five ounces of gold, the level reached at gold's peak in 2011. The Dow and gold may again cross, similar to what happened in 1980 and almost happened in 1932-4.Each peak in the Dow-gold ratio (1929, 1969, and 1999) coincided with periods of commodity undervaluation. As each commodity bull market started, the Dow-gold ratio contracted massively. In 1929, commodities bottomed relative to financial assets exactly as the Dow reached a high of twenty ounces of gold equivalent. Four short years later, commodities were overvalued relative to financial assets, and the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold after having rallied 70%.In 1968 (the year President Johnson removed the US dollar’s required 25% gold backing), commodities were the cheapest in history relative to financial assets. At that moment, the Dow peaked at twenty-eight ounces of gold. Over the next twelve years, commodities entered a massive bull market and, by 1980, had become radically overvalued. Gold led the bull market and soared twenty-four-fold from $35 to $800 per ounce. Like in 1929, the Dow-gold ratio peaked in 1968 at precisely the same time commodities bottomed. By January 1980, the Dow was equivalent to one ounce of gold – the lowest reading since the Dow Jones Industrial Average was established in 1896.In 1999, commodities were almost as radically undervalued as in the late 1960s. The Dow-gold ratio reached an all-time high of forty-two just as commodities bottomed. As commodity prices rose, the Dow-gold ratio contracted, reaching eight in 2011.Were commodities overvalued today, we would agree that the boom in financial assets (and bear market in gold) still had years left to run. Under these circumstances, the Dow-gold ratio would continue to move significantly higher. Instead, commodities are as undervalued as they have ever been relative to financial assets. According to our historical framework, a commodity bull market has likely started. As such, we believe the Dow, equivalent to twenty ounces of gold, probably represents a cycle-high and will fall throughout the decade, similar to 1929, 1969, and 1999.How high could prices go if we enter a new gold bull market?In past gold bull markets, the value of the Treasury’s gold holdings has surpassed the monetary base by over 1.5 times – including in 1980 after the US dollar was no longer backed by gold.Given the Fed’s balance sheet explosion since 2009, a projected target price for gold seems outlandish. The Fed’s monetary base today stands at $5.6 tr. For the Treasury’s gold holdings to cover the monetary base by 1.5 times, gold would have to reach $32,000 per ounce. Critics might argue the monetary base is distorted by excess reserves left on balance at the Fed. At present, excess reserves foot to $3.2 tr, and the Fed has talked of someday draining them out of the system. If that were to happen, the Fed’s monetary base would fall to $2.4 trillion. Even under this conservative scenario, gold would have to reach $14,000 for the Treasury’s gold position to cover the monetary base by 1.5 times. Although these numbers sound outlandish, they represent relationships that have emerged twice in the past 100 years. The first time (the late 1930s) was during massive deflation, while the second (1970) was during inflation. In both scenarios, gold had become the “must own” asset class that all investors clamored for, and the valuation of gold was pushed to the extreme.Could the dollar value of the Treasury’s gold holdings reach 1.5 times the monetary base-- as it has twice in the last 100 years? We believe it’s highly probable. As financial turmoil surges this decade, investors will aggressively buy gold as an asset class that provides both wealth protection and the opportunity for huge speculative profit. In such a scenario, gold’s valuation could very well be pushed to extremes just like it was in the late 1930s and 1980. What about looking at the Dow-Gold relationship?In the 1930s, the Fed aggressively shrunk its balance sheet by half, producing a deflation implosion that turned into the Great Depression. At the worst point in the crisis, the Dow traded at half its $80 book value. By 1934, gold (now at $35 per ounce) nearly reached parity with the Dow. Currently, the Dow’s book value is 8,000. Were the Fed to undertake equally draconian hawkish measures as in the 1930s (something we believe to be unlikely), the Dow could conceivably trade for half its book value, or 4,000. Were gold to trade at parity to the Dow, like it nearly did in 1934, it would more than double. In other words, in the most extreme deflationary scenario, the Dow would fall almost 90% while gold would double – similar to between 1929 and 1934. Investors, with a substantial gold allocation, would do very well.In the late 1970s, the Fed ultimately raised interest rates to record levels in a final successful attempt to break the inflationary forces of the past twenty years. Record real rates put severe downward pressure on global equities. By 1980, the Dow traded at its book value of 850. Gold reached parity with the Dow in January 1980.If we repeat the 1970s and the Fed raised interest rates significantly because of persistent acceleration in inflation, we should see a huge bear market in the Dow with a downside target of its 8000 book value. If history were to repeat the 1970s experience, the Dow toenter a huge bear market and potentially trade down 75% to its book value, and gold prices would rise four –fold Again, investors with significant gold allocations would be the winners.Finally, let us consider a third scenario that has never occurred in 230 years of US financial history. What might happen if the US directly monetized its debt?Given the massive amount of sovereign debt held by governments worldwide and the inherent refinancing risks that it creates, countries (including the US) may attempt to directly monetize their debt in response to a potential failure of a government debt auction. Were this to happen, inflationary pressures would surge, and hyperinflation may ensue. Our hunch is that equities markets may rise, but gold would enter a massive bull market as investors sought assets to protect against currency debasement and the resulting inflation. In such a scenario, gold could easily surpass $35,000 per ounce – 1.5 times today’s $5.6 tr monetary base. Once again, the winners would be gold investors.In our view, gold will emerge as the asset class with the most potential this decade, no matter the financial or geopolitical backdrop. Under the most extreme scenarios (a repeat of the deflationary implosion that produced the Great Depression or a period of inflation that verges on hyperinflation), gold will be the winning asset class.Commodities and related natural resource markets were broadly weak in the second quarter. Investors remained concerned about a global recession driven by rising interest rates and persistent central bank hawkishness. Adding to the overall gloom was a perceived disappointment in Chinese economic activity. Caused by problems in the real estate sector, disappointing exports, and weaker-than-expected aggregate economic data, investors were decidedly “risk-off ” when it came to China, and commodity markets were not spared.With its heavy energy focus, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index fell almost 6%, while the Rogers International Commodity Index, emphasizing metals and agricultural commodities, fell by 2.5%.Natural resource-related equities were weak as well. The S&P North American Natural Resource Stock Index (heavily energy weighted) fell 1% during the quarter, while the S&P Global Natural Resources Index (, more metal and agricultural exposure) fell almost 6%. By comparison, global equity markets were strong during the second quarter: the S&P 500 rose 8% while the MSCI All Country World index advanced almost 6%.Metals were among the weakest performers in the second quarter, reflecting concerns about China. Copper prices pulled back 9%, despite easily mobilized copper inventories approaching all-time lows during the quarter. Nickel fared even worse, falling by 14%. Aluminum, meanwhile, fell by 11%, while zinc plummeted by 21%. Cold-rolled steel fell almost 25% in the ferrous metal sector, while iron ore fell 10%. Mining equities were also weak. The  ETF (which tracks copper equities) fell by almost 3%, while the S&P Global Base Metals Index fell by 4%.Weak LNG and Chinese worries drove coal prices lower. Australian and South African thermal coal pulled back 30% and 22%, respectively. In the US, coal with access to seaborne markets (notably Central Appalachian and Illinois Basin) fell 28% and 32%, respectively, after surging last year.The oil market was also weak during the second quarter. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell almost 7% during the quarter, while Brent fell 5%. Energy-related equities were mixed. The  ETF (mega-cap international energy weighted) fell 2%. However, the S&P Oil & Gas E&P index and the  oil service stock ETF were strong, rising by 1% and 4%, respectively.Global energy demand continues to surprise to the upside, and even the IEA has raised its estimates. For example, at the end of 2022, the IEA estimated global oil demand would average 101.6 mm barrels per day -- a significant 1.7 mm increase over 2022. In their June “Oil Market Report,” the IEA raised their 2023 demand estimate by an additional 700,000 b/d, with the bulk of their underestimation again coming from China. Since the end of 2022, the IEA has raised its Chinese oil demand estimates by 400,000 b/d.Responding to global recession worries, the IEA reduced global oil demand by 200,000 b/d in its July 2023 OMR. However, we believe the IEA is still radically underestimating global oil demand and that further upward revisions must be made. For example, the IEA has 1.3 mm b/d of missing barrels in its first quarter 2023 balances. Our readers know that missing barrels represent the excess of supply less demand that are missing—literally-- they can’t be found in global inventories. Historically the IEA has made missing barrels disappear by revising global demand upwards, and we believe this time will be no different. We believe the weakness in oil prices in the second quarter can’t be explained by faltering demand.We believe the primary weakness in global oil prices in the second quarter is unexpected supply issues. In the final week of March, the US government began selling an additional 26 mm barrels of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil under previously legislated Congressional mandates. All 26 mm barrels had been sold by the last week of June. Over the next four years, the DOE, under Congressional mandate, was scheduled to sell an additional 155 mm barrels of oil out of the SPR—42.5 mm barrels in 2024 and 2025 and 35 mm barrels in 2026 and 2027, and these sales would represent almost 50% of the remaining SPR reserve.In July, however, the DOE announced the cancellation of these sales as part of the attempt to begin “refilling” the SPR. Over the last 18 months, 330 mm barrels have been released by US, European, and Japanese SPR and have been 100% responsible for the slight build we’ve seen in commercial inventories. Given July’s DOE announcement, SPR sales will be zero over the next four years, which we believe has already begun impacting oil prices. We think it’s no coincidence that oil prices rebounded almost 18% since the last week in June—just as US SPR releases wound down.SPR sale cancellations, combined with rapidly slowing production growth from the Permian basin and unexpected production cuts from Saudi Arabia, mean that commercial inventories will experience rapid drawdowns in the second half of 2023.Natural gas staged a massive rebound in the second quarter, advancing 26%. European gas, still influenced by swollen inventories related to last winter’s record warmth, fell by 26%. Asian gas also continued its retreat—falling 5%.With the restart of the Freeport LNG export facility, US inventories have begun to decline versus historical averages, even in the face of highly cool weather at the beginning of the 2023 air conditioning season. Adjusted for population, cooling degree days were 33% below average for May and June. US natural gas inventories peaked relative to ten-year averages in mid-March, just before the Freeport facility returned to service, and now sit only 6% above ten-year averages.We remain incredibly bullish on natural gas prices. The Natural Gas section of the letter discusses the rollover in Marcellus natural gas production and how the 40% plunge in the Haynesville rig count over the last six months will severely impact its output in the next six months. In the next eighteen months, we will add close to 6 bcf per day in LNG export capacity, and our modeling continues to suggest that US natural gas supply will begin a prolonged contraction starting now. Convergence of US natural gas prices-presently at $2.50 per MMBtu with international prices—presently at $12mmbtu—is practically unavoidable given our modeling of both US natural gas demand and supply. Much of the turmoil in global gas markets, weather-related over the last twelve months, has given investors another extremely opportunistic chance to invest in North American natural gas markets.Uranium rose 10% from $50 to $55 per pound in the second quarter. In the Uranium section of the letter, we discuss our updated supply and demand models for uranium and their implications. Since 2011—post-Fukushima—the global uranium market has been in massive surplus as Japan’s 50 reactors came offline and global uranium supply surged—primarily from Kazakhstan. Between 2011 and 2018, we calculate global uranium inventories built by over 265 m lbs, resulting in substantial downward price pressure—uranium prices bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2018 at $18 per lb.However, as our models suggest, the uranium market has now slipped firmly back into deficit. Also, the Yellow Cake and Sprott Uranium Trust closed-end physical uranium investment vehicles have removed over 80 mm lbs of uranium over the last five years. Since 2020 we calculate that uranium has shifted back to deficit and that commercial inventories have been drawn down by 180 mm tonnes. We calculate excess commercial uranium inventories related to the Fukushima-related shutdowns have now been 50% worked down and stand at approximately 250 mm lbs, covering reactor demand by less than 18 months.Depending on how much physical uranium the two closed-end vehicle buy in 2023 and 2024, we calculate that 100% of the excess Fukushima-related inventory will have been consumed by the end of 2024. Given the deficit between power generation demand and mine supply, and given that almost all easily mobilized Fukishima-related inventory has been removed from the market, we believe uranium prices could move chaotically to the upside.Global agricultural markets fell in the second quarter. Corn fell 16%, wheat fell 8%, and soybeans rose 3.5%.Fertilizers also sold off. Urea (the solid form of nitrogen) fell 10%, phosphate fell 27%, and potash fell 3%. We believe the correction has run its course, and markets have now set up for another crisis. Dry weather continues to plague the corn belt. In their latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate report (WASDE), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) significantly reduced their US corn yield estimate from 181.5 to 177.5 bushels per acre.Food nationalism has also reemerged. Once again, India banned rice exports as adverse growing conditions lowered the expected harvest. India is the largest rice exporter, representing almost 50% of the seaborne trade. Finally, Russia suspended its agreement allowing Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea. Also, the Russian military has now started to systematically target Ukrainian grain infrastructure over the last month, including Ukraine’s grain export facilities on the Danube River.Ukrainian wheat and corn exports were already halved compared with their peak two years ago. After the recent destruction, a further reduction in export volumes is a distinct possibility. In 2021, we predicted a coming agricultural crisis. Our same models now call for a new crisis to develop as we progress through the rest of the year and into 2024. The recent pullback presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Precious metals were weak in the second quarter. Gold fell 2.5%, while silver fell 5%. Platinum and palladium fell 10% and 17%, respectively.Gold and silver equities were also weak. The  and  ETFs (which track gold and silver equities) fell by 7% and 15%, respectively.Earlier in this letter, we outlined the fundamental underpinnings of the upcoming gold bull market and provided a framework for how high gold prices might go.Since the summer of 2020, precious metals have been in a corrective phase. We believe things are about to turn much more bullish.On a short-term basis, one headwind remains. Western investors have again started to liquidate their precious metals holdings.We track the behavior of 18 gold ETFs. For the twelve months ending March 2023, the ETFs liquidated 450 tonnes of gold. Beginning in April, the ETFs stopped shedding. For a moment, it appeared they were starting a period of accumulation. The same ETFs added 60 tonnes of gold holdings from March to May. Unfortunately, western investors returned to shedding over the last two months, this time by 100 tonnes.The ETFs indicate Western interest in gold remains bearish. Western investors, we believe, will drive the upcoming bull market. Thus far, they remain uninterested.On a more positive note, central banks continue to buy gold. In the first six months of 2023, central banks purchased 387 tonnes of gold – a record first-half result, according to the World Gold Council. China accumulated 103 tonnes in the first six months of 2023 and has continuously purchased gold over the last nine months.Since the start of the corrective phase in mid-2020, the ETFs have shed over 600 tonnes of gold.Over the same period, open interest in the COMEX gold futures contract contracted by over 300,000 contracts – or 900 tonnes of “paper gold,” the majority of which were likely matched with physical gold. In total, we estimated western speculators have shed 1,500 tonnes. Central banks, meanwhile, have more than offset this liquidation. Between 2020 and mid-2023, central banks accumulated 2,200 tonnes of physical gold. It stands to reason that prices are now re-testing the mid-2020 highs. Even though western investors have been gold sellers, all selling has been met with central bank buying. We believe western investors will turn into aggressive buyers once central banks turn dovish. When that happens, western demand will collide with central bank buying and gold prices will move dramatically higher. As outlined in our introductory essay, gold prices are heading much higher than anyoneenvisions today. We recommend all investors have significant positions in various precious metal investments, both physical and equities.Why has uranium rallied while every other energy commodity has collapsed? Over the past twelve months, spot uranium advanced 12% while oil, natural gas, and coal all fell anywhere from 30-70%. Our models suggest uranium’s strong performance has just started. Uranium has likely reached a pivotal inflection point that could force the price higher by as much as three- to four-fold over the next several years. For the first time in history, uranium has slipped into a persistent and widening deficit. We believe the results will be dramatic. Uranium is much less transparent than other commodity markets; in this essay, we will help shed light on the forces driving uranium over the course of the decade.From the start of the nuclear age in 1945 until 2019, the uranium industry has gone through four distinct periods. Each period has been unique in terms of supply and demand, leading to wild price swings that lasted decades. The market has now definitively entered its fifth major period, likely defined by persistent severe deficits.The first period took place between the mid-1940s and the late 1960s. Governmental stockpiling, for both weapons programs and nuclear power advancement, drove demand. Following the Trinity test in Los Alamos and the subsequent bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, attention quickly turned to nuclear’s commercial applications. The USSR and England inaugurated the first two nuclear power stations in 1954 and 1956, with England’s being the first truly commercial reactor. Despite these early reactors, commercial demand remained extremely low. Throughout the Manhattan Project, a persistent shortage of uranium (along with enrichment bottlenecks), presented ongoing challenges. Protection of supply remained a pivotal point of national security after the war as first the US and then the USSR built up their atomic arsenals. Between 1945 and 1969, Nuclear Engineering International estimates global uranium mine supply totaled 900 mm lbs of triuranium octoxide (U3O8). Roughly half of this material was purchased by the US Atomic Energy Commission (), while 40 mm lbs was purchased by the nascent commercial nuclear energy industry. Although the remaining 226 mm lbs was officially unaccounted for, it likely made its way to a combination of American, British, French, and Soviet government stockpiles.The uranium market began to change in the early 1970s as commercial nuclear power gained adoption. Private sector utility buying became a dominant source of demand. Total installed capacity grew from 1 GWe in 1960 to 10 GWe by 1970 and 100 GWe by 1980. The arrival in earnest of the nuclear age also stoked a speculative boom in uranium mining. Production in the US peaked in 1980 at nearly 45 mm lbs of U3O8 per year. Despite the widespread adoption of nuclear power, mine supply actually grew faster than reactor demand throughout the decade. The 1970s were a period of rolling energy crises and insecurity. As a result, commercial buyers were more than happy to build up excess uranium inventories. From 1970 to 1983, mine supply exceeded reactor demand by 450 mm lbs of U3O8, all of which ended up in commercial inventories. Adding to the glut, the AEC reclassified approximately 100 mm lbs of its stockpiles from “governmental” to “commercial,” making it available to the nuclear power industry. By 1983, commercial inventories were 550 mm lbs – enough to cover reactor demand for nearly eight years. Prices peaked in 1982 at nearly $40 per pound and started a decades-long collapse.Uranium mine supply peaked in 1982 and fell modestly during the decade. Reactor demand meanwhile grew robustly and finally exceeded mine supply in 1991. For the first time since the days of the Manhattan Project, uranium entered into a primary deficit. The deficit would persist for the next twenty-seven years, until the Fukushima incident. Unlike during the Manhattan Project, however, secondary sources of uranium filled the shortfall. Between 1983 and 2010, Nuclear Engineering International estimates reactor demand exceeded mine supply by an incredible 1.1 bn lbs of U3O8. Mine supply fell by nearly half from 170 mm lbs in 1982 to a plateau of 75 mm lbs by 1995. Reactor demand was nearly the mirror image, growing from 65 to 175 mm lbs over the 27-year period. Secondary supply made up the shortfall.In 1993, Russia and the US entered into the so-called “Megatons for Megawatts” program, through which Russia pledged to decommission 20,000 nuclear warheads and convert the highly enriched uranium into 15,000 tonnes of low-enriched uranium suitable for manufacturing into reactor fuel. Russia also sold additional material outside of the program to provide much-needed funding following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Fuel recycling became widespread in the UK and France during this period as well, as did enrichment-tailing reprocessing. Secondary sources supplied a combined 630 mm lbs of U3O8-equivalent between 1983 and 2010. Commercial inventory destocking contributed another 500 mm lbs. The Department of Energy (the successor to the AEC), reclassified another 75 mm lbs of U3O8 from governmental to commercial, adding more material to the commercial market. All of this secondary supply put extreme downward pressure on uranium. Prices bottomed at $7.10 per pound in 2000.By the mid-2000s, commercial inventories had fallen dramatically. The Russian disarmament program was due to expire in 2013, threatening to reduce secondary supplies materially. Uranium began to firm in 2003; by 2005 the price had tripled from $7 to $21 per pound. By the late 2000s, commercial inventories had fallen nearly 70% and stood at only 200 mm lbs. Commercial inventory coverage went from eight years in 1983 to less than two years by 2007. Utility buyers scrambled and speculators swooped in.Spot prices reached a high of $136 per pound in June 2007, with long-term contracts settling at $95 per pound: an increase of between twelve- and eighteen-fold in seven years. Uranium collapsed during the Global Financial Crisis, but resumed its rally in 2010. By February 2011, uranium was once again over $70 per pound and commercial inventories stood at a mere 150 mm lbs.On March 11 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami led to a partial meltdown of Japan’s Fukushima Daishi reactor. Japan shut down all its nuclear reactors over the next several years. European demand, led by German decommissioning, fell by 25%. Global reactor demand fell sharply from 182 mm to 150 mm lbs between 2010 and 2012 before beginning a slow recovery. Meanwhile, responding (with a lag) to the prior uranium boom, primary supply grew for the first time in decades. In-situ leach production in Kazakhstan grew by nearly 50%, or 20 mm lbs, between 2010 and 2016. Primary production nearly satisfied reactor demand in 2015 – a first in over twenty-five years.Secondary supplies weighed on the market as well. Although the Russian disarmament program ended in 2013, tailings reenrichment, DOE surplus sales, recycling and underfeeding continued to contribute as much as 40 mm lbs of U3O8-equivalent by 2016.Between 2011 and 2018, the uranium market was in surplus by 265 mm lbs., all of which ended up in commercial inventories. Commercial stockpiles, which started the period at a record-low 150 mm lbs., reached 415 mm lbs. by 2018, covering reactor demand for three years.We became interested in uranium producers this cycle in late 2017, when Cameco announced they would curtail production at its flagship MacArthur River Mine. Kazatomprom followed suit, announcing it would curtail production. Our models told us these cuts would push reactor demand firmly above total supply, including secondary sources. In retrospect, we were correct. Commercial inventories peaked in 2018 and declined slightly in 2019 and 2020. The era of persistent deficits had started.The uranium price meanwhile remained depressed, averaging less than $25 per pound between 2016 and 2020.Uranium’s structural deficit has accelerated dramatically since 2021. Reactor demand bottomed in 2020 at 161 mm lbs of U3O8 and is expected to reach 188 mm lbs this year. After spending a decade decommissioning its nuclear reactors, Europe and the US appear to have finally reversed course. We have long argued that wind and solar simply cannot provide efficient base-load carbon-free electricity. We warned that grid instability and energy insecurity would soon follow. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 put Europe’s natural gas supply at risk, bringing renewables’ shortcomings to the fore. Primary uranium production remained depressed through 2022 at 120 mm lbs – a multi-decade low. Secondary supply averaged only 22 mm lbs. leaving a deficit of nearly 30 mm lbs in 2021 and 2022.A new source of demand burst onto the scene in 2021 as well: the financial buyer. Led by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, financial vehicles have acquired between 25 and 30 mm lbs each year in 2021 and 2022. Unlike open-ended funds such as the GLD, the financial uranium vehicles are closed-ended, meaning the material cannot readily flow back into the commercial market. Once material is purchased it is permanently locked up.As a result, the uranium market experienced a deficit of nearly 180 mm lbs between 2020 and 2023. The deficit was met by materially depleting the commercial inventories that had accumulated following Fukushima. By the end of this year, we expect commercial inventories will be back to 250 mm lbs, covering reactor demand by less than 18 months. The last time commercial inventories reached these levels in the mid-2000s, prices spiked to their all-time highs of $145 per pound. We expect the same now.Looking to the end of the decade, global uranium markets are set to tighten to unprecedented levels. Looking only at nuclear power plants that are currently under construction, reactor demand is set to grow from 188 to 240 mm lbs by 2030. If every uranium-producing country gets back to its maximum output (a big if ), primary production will only grow from 140 to 174 mm pounds by 2030. Assuming secondary supply stays flat at 20 mm lbs per year, the annual uranium market deficit will grow from 27 to 45 mm lbs by the end of the decade, before factoring in further financial buying. The cumulative deficit between 2023 and 2030 will likely exceed 250 mm lbs, completely depleting all commercial stockpiles.These figures are likely too conservative. There are presently fifty-nine reactors under construction with a total capacity of 66 GWe. Every new reactor requires three years of uranium fuel for its initial core loading. We believe this will consume an additional 60 mm lbs of U3O8 between now and 2030. Over the past twenty years, new reactors have been mostly offset by retirements. When a reactor is decommissioned, it is able to harvest its final core loading without requiring a replacement. Therefore, new reactor loadings have been offset by retiring old reactors. This will not be possible going forward.Furthermore, financial accumulation is likely to accelerate once speculators realize the small size of the market and the precarious commercial inventory situation. How large financial buying can get is an open question, however adding another 100 mm lbs of U3O8 would only cost $6 bn and would dramatically tighten balances even further.Utilities remain dramatically under-contracted post-2025. Fuel buyers have been very complacent in recent years, due to the persistent commercial inventory overhang following Fukushima. Simply put, it has paid to wait to secure supplies. That dynamic is quickly changing as fuel buyers feel insecure and under-covered for the first time in nearly fifteen years.Although it is an opaque market, all signs point to uranium entering into a sustained and frenetic bull market. Prices have rallied from a 2018 low of $18 to nearly $60 per pound already. However, even at these prices, it is unlikely many new greenfield uranium deposits can be economically developed.The uranium industry has been dramatically starved of capital for many years. In our view, the persistent bear market – in many ways present since the 1980s with only a single reprieve – is over. Investors should act accordingly.We believe oil is on the verge of a sharp rally. As we write this, West Texas Intermediate and Brent trade for $84 and $87 per barrel, respectively. We believe it will not be long before both are well above $100. Since the COVID bottom in March 2020, energy equities have been the best-performing sector of the S&P 500, while spot crude has been the best-performing asset class. However, for the twelve months ending June 2023, spot crude fell by 33%. The question has been whether the recent selloff was a consolidation amidst a broader rally or the start of a new bear market.We are adamant in our belief that this bull market has only begun and prices will increase. All of the bullish elements we have discussed remain firmly in place: the industry is still highly capital-starved, oil demand is strong, and the US shales are depleting.The recent selloff resulted from massive liquidations from various strategic petroleum reserves. For 2022, the US released 220 mm from its SPR, amounting to 607,000 b/d. Other countries liquidated 40 m b or 100,000 b/d. The US continued liquidating its SPR into 2023 as well. Although concerns surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have prompted SPR liquidations last spring, this year’s sales were part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which mandated the US to sell oil from the SPR to fund spending bills. During the second quarter, the US released 25 mm bbl from the SPR or 260,000 b/d.Our last letter explained the tight relationship between price and seasonally-adjusted inventory levels. Oil is fairly valued at $75 per barrel based only on commercial inventories. Including the now-depleted SPRs, oil should be trading at $120. Therefore, we estimate the impact of the SPR releases at anywhere between $30-40 per barrel. It is no coincidence that as soon as the US stopped liquidating its SPR at the end of June, oil bottomed and has since rallied 20%.The Bipartisan Budget Act SPR sales automatically “phased out” if reserves reached 350 mm barrels. When Congress passed the Act, the SPR held 650 mm barrels, and it is likely few policymakers ever expected to use the “phase out” provision. However, with the SPR now at just 347 mm barrels, the Act no longer allows further liquidation. Just last week, the administration announced it would cancel all additional planned sales from the SPR. With the US no longer selling several hundred thousand barrels per day from its strategic reserves, commercial inventories are set to fall sharply throughout the rest of the year, pushing prices higher.Even with the unprecedented SPR liquidation, commercial inventories remained subdued. Inventories peaked at 280 mm barrels above and bottomed at 60 mm below the five-year average in 2020 and 2022, respectively. Presently, inventories are in line with the five-year average. Including the SPR, inventories are 300 mm barrels below five-year averages – a record deficit.Global inventories are just as tight. OECD commercial inventories went from 300 mm bbl above to 300 mm bbl below five-year averages between 2020 and 2022 and currently stand at 95 mm bbl below average. Including government stockpiles, inventories remain 400 mm bbl below average – another record.Based upon our supply and demand estimates, inventories could draw by 360 mm bbl between now and yearend, leaving commercial and total inventories at dangerously-low levels.Despite headlines to the contrary, the oil market remained extremely tight over the past twelve months. Governments effectively hindered the bullish price signal by liquidating vast quantities from their strategic reserves. This is unlikely to continue, clearing the way for prices to increase.Most analysts attribute the selloff to recession fears and weak demand, but our data tells us consumption remains robust. For nearly fifteen years, headlines have called for the “end of oil demand.” As recently as 2020, many agencies, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), predicted that 2019 was the peak in global oil demand. Hardly four years later, consumption set a new record and shows no signs of slowing. Any worries about long-term structural oil demand are entirely misguided for at least the next decade.The oil market will be driven higher by lackluster supply caused by years of underinvestment. Demand, meanwhile, will enjoy a persistent tailwind and continue to consistently surprise to the upside. In our following letter, we will write extensively on global commodity demand; today, we offer a preview.Energy consumers fall into two categories: those in the developed world and those in emerging markets. The former comprises 17% of the world’s population and consumes 170 GJ per person of primary energy. The latter makes up 83% of the population (or seven billion people) and annually consumes less than 60 GJ per person. Each year, millions begin their move from emerging-market to lower-middle-income energy consumers.As they prosper, their primary energy consumption triples from 60 to 170 GJ annually. This phenomenon will be the primary growth driver over the next twenty years. Analysts pontificate on EV penetration, but even the most aggressive scenarios cannot overcome this dramatic increase in primary energy demand per capita. Others worry about energy efficiency. Again, the move from emerging markets to lower middle-income energy consumers will eclipse any improvement in energy efficiency.For example, over the last fifteen years, OECD per capita energy demand fell by 11%, primarily due to improved energy efficiency. However, non-OECD per capita demand surged by 25%, pushing global per capita demand higher by 5%: the so-called “S-Curve” at work. While it is true that, in theory, making something more energy efficient should reduce demand, in practice, the trend has been towards more demand, not less. More people are in the energy-intensive period of their development, moving from 60 GJ to 170 GJ of primary energy demand. According to Jevons’ Paradox, efficiency may lead to faster growth. In 1865, Jevons postulated that improved energy efficiency would lower costs and ultimately increase demand. While his Paradox is controversial, we believe there is evidence of this phenomenon in emerging market economies.Amazingly, in their latest long-term forecast, the IEA projects global per capita primary energy demand will fall between now and 2035. Simply put, this cannot happen. The IEA (and others) will chronically miss the mark until they realize this.The IEA has also warned about near-term oil demand; we believe these worries are similarly unfounded. In their latest Oil Market Report, the IEA revised down 2Q23, 3Q23, and 4Q23 demand estimates by 250,000 b/d. In their summary (which is released to the press ahead of the full report), they warned that “persistent macroeconomic headwinds, apparent in a deepening manufacturing slump, have led us to revise our 2023 growth estimate lower for the first time this year, by 220 kb/d.”The IEA neglects to mention how they quietly revised historical demand higher for 2020, 2021, and 2022. They also revised 2024 estimates higher as well. Furthermore, the 1Q23 balancing item ran at a near-record 1.4 m b/d, suggesting global demand likely reached 101.9 m b/d – a record level for any quarter and a full 2.5 m b/d above 1Q22. In their long term Oil 2023 report, the IEA expects oil consumption to grow by 6% between now and 2030, or by 900,000 b/d, not materially lower than the fifteen years between 2005 and 2019 despite all the talk of EVs and efficiency. In 2020, the IEA predicted 2019 marked peak oil demand. Only a few years later, the IEA pushed its prediction to 2030. We have no doubt this revised out further as well.While investors remain fixated on demand, they seem to neglect problems in the global oil supply. In our last letter, we wrote about depletion problems in the Permian basin. Over the past 15 years, the US shales were the only material source of non-OPEC+ growth. In turn, the Permian has represented most of all shale growth over the past five years. We warned that emerging depletion in the Permian would have a massive impact on global oil markets.Since we last wrote, Permian depletion has accelerated. Last year marked the first time Permian productivity per lateral foot decreased year-over-year, falling by 7%. For the first three months of 2023, productivity per foot fell by a further 4% compared with 2022. According to the Energy Information Agency (), by August, the Permian will be growing by only 360,000 b/d year-on-year, compared with nearly 700,000 b/d as recently as February. Our models suggest that year-on-year Permian growth will be less than 100,000 b/d by year-end and turn negative in early 2024. Although the next few months may be bumpy, we believe the Permian will definitively roll over sometime in 2024 as companies run out of their best drilling prospects. Despite high prices, producers dropped fourteen rigs in the Permian over the past three months, potentially signally inventory exhaustion. The other US shales are not faring any better. Shale production outside the Permian has not grown in nearly three years, despite oil rallying from $20 to $75 per barrel. The only material source of non-OPEC+ growth over the past fifteen years is about to peak.The IEA meanwhile predicts non-OPEC+ production ex-US to grow by 400,000 b/d this year. However, we believe this is too optimistic. Since first releasing their projections last summer, the IEA has systematically revised non-OPEC+ ex-US production lower by 300,000 b/d and we believe this trend will continue.As non-OPEC+ production falters, OPEC+ will gain market share and pricing power. In early August, Saudi Arabia announced they would extend their production cuts by at least another month. Saudi produced less than 10 m b/d in May and June – a thirteen year low. Some analysts view the cuts as an admission of weak global demand. Based on our demand analysis, we disagree. We and other analysts believe the cuts are necessary to rest aging fields, including Ghawar. Still, others argue the Saudis are merely offsetting government SPR liquidations. Whatever the case, several years ago, the Saudis would have been far too worried about losing market share to the growing shales to cut production. That concern is now gone.According to the IEA, demand will average 103.2 m b/d in the second half of 2023. Global supply (including OPEC NGLs, processing gains, and biofuels) will only reach 101.5 m b/d, leaving the market undersupplied by a massive 1.7 m b/d. We think this understates the problem. The balancing item ran at 1.3 m b/d in the first quarter, suggesting demand was understated. Adjusting demand higher by 1 m b/d for the rest of the year implies a 2.7 m b/d deficit that would take inventories down by over 400 mm bbl by December 31st. At that point, commercial inventories would reach a record 500 mm bbl deficit while total inventories would reach a record 820 mm bbl deficit – the lowest levels since our data begins.We are amazed at the level of investor apathy and disinterest. Despite three years of market-leading performance, funds continue to flow out of significant energy ETFs, including the XOP and XLE.The past six months saw the lowest level of energy IPOs and secondary offerings in nearly 25 years. Capital spending trends remain depressed and corporate valuations are at record lows. Energy remains less than 4% of the S&P 500, nearly two-thirds below its long-term average. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Buffett has steadily added to his Chevron and Occidental Petroleum positions. Berkshire Hathaway added to his Occidental Petroleum position in the second quarter and now owns 25% of the company. Investors have radically undercapitalized the energy industry over the past ten years, and the results are becoming apparent. The only way to attract capital back to the space will be through solid returns. We believe that by the end of this bull market, everyone will argue that energy is again the “must-own” sector. Still, for the time being, contrarian value investors are being offered an excellent opportunity with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations. Investors will not be able to remain apathetic for much longer.In our view, natural gas prices are reaching a turning point. Gas spiked to decade highs last spring following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, only to fall back on milder-than-normal winter weather. Instead of running out of gas, traders worried about running out of storage as prices collapsed to near-all-time lows.During market panic or euphoria, investors make the mistake of linearly extrapolating current trends. As a result, they fail to see the ground shifting underneath them and miss out on excellent opportunities. Natural gas represents a classic buying opportunity, and we believe investors are again focused on all the wrong issues.Only several weeks ago, we heard many analysts openly question whether the US would run out of natural gas storage before the end of the injection season. Such an event would create the dreaded “gas on gas competition,” potentially driving prices to zero (or below). With the injection season half complete, these concerns were unfounded. Inventories started the year in line with seasonal averages. Extremely mild weather resulted in nearly 5% fewer heating degree days between January and April, significantly reducing heating demand. Inventories grew to 382 bcf above seasonal averages by April. Mild winter weather was followed by a mild start to summer. Cooling degree days in April, May, and June were nearly 30% below the five-year average, reducing air conditioning demand. Despite the milder-than-normal start to summer, US inventories did not grow relative to seasonal averages.Bymid-June, inventories remained 385 bcf above average. As the weather turned warmer in July, inventories have started to come down and currently stand at 320 bcf above average, the lowest level since February. Notably, July was 3% milder than average, suggesting the market would be in an even more significant deficit had temperatures been average. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports help explain why US inventories declined relative to seasonal averages despite mild weather. LNG demand reached a record of 12.5 bcf/d in May as Freeport returned online after a damaging fire left it inoperable for over a year. Based upon our analysis, the likelihood of full storage by the end of the injection season in the fall is very low; gas prices will likely rally from here.Over the next two years, an additional six billion cubic feet of LNG exports will come online at Golden Pass, Plaquemines, and Corpus Christi. Another 1.6 bcf/d is due to come online at Port Arthur in 2027. Where will these facilities source their gas?In our last letter, we explained how the same depletion issues plaguing the oil shales are also at work in the gas shales. The Marcellus represents 25% of all US dry gas supply and has not grown in nearly two years. Production peaked in late 2021 at 26.5 bcf/d – almost one bcf/d higher than current levels. The Permian produces natural gas alongside oil, but declining productivity across the basin suggests sustained growth will be difficult.The Haynesville surged to nearly eight bcf/d by 2011 before declining by half through 2017. Renewed interest led to a second period of growth, until by late 2022, production peaked at 14.3 bcf/d. Unfortunately, production has now been flat for eight months. The Haynesville is deep and highly over pressured, resulting in elevated drilling and completion costs. Companies raced to lay down rigs as prices fell from $7.00 per mcf in December 2022 to $2.00 by February 2023.After peaking at seventy-two rigs in December, there are now only forty-four rigs operating in the play, with most of the decline occurring in June. Production often follows drilling with a several-month lag. If seventy-two rigs cannot produce much growth in the first few months of 2023, then production will likely fall from here. High prices would likely incentivize increased drilling in Haynesville, similar to what happened in 2017. However, the field had only produced 20% of its reserves back then compared with nearly 50% presently. It will likely be more challenging—if not impossible-- to boost production this time once basin-level declines take hold, considering it is a much more mature play.Our models tell us we have overbuilt our LNG export capacity without adequately considering where the upstream feedstock will come from. US natural gas remains by far the cheapest unit of energy globally by as much as 75%. Once demand, driven by LNG expansion, exceeds domestic supply, our expectation is that this discount will evaporate, sending US gas prices up several-fold, as US prices converge with international prices.Turning to Europe, hot summer weather was not enough to offset their record mild winter (air conditioning in Europe remains less prevalent than in North America). European gas storage is now 88% full compared with an average of 74% for this time of year – a surplus of 14 percentage points. While still high, this is much lower than the record set after the winter on March 26th when inventories reached 56% full, a 22% surplus compared with seasonal averages.In March, the German energy minister Klaus Mueller warned that Germany would run out of natural gas by January 2024 on colder than average weather. Considering inventories at the time were running further ahead of seasonal averages than they are today, we would expect his concerns have not lessened.Both US and global natural gas markets rest on a knife’s edge. After last year’s incredibly mild winter, inventories are no longer at dangerously low levels. However, the longer-term supply and demand trends point to extreme tightening, particularly in the US. Investors are extrapolating current trends but missing the significant shifts taking place. They should take heed.Driven by concerns of an impending global recession, copper sentiment remained bearish during the second quarter. On the other hand, copper’s short-term fundamentals became increasingly bullish. Mine supply disappointed again in the first four months of 2023, according to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics (WBMS). Chilean production continues to be particularly problematic.For the first four months of the year, Chilean mine supply fell by nearly 2% compared to last year. Codelco warned that production could hit the lowest level in twenty-five years. In June, André Sougarret abruptly resigned as Codelco’s Chief Executive Officer after only one year on the job. Mr. Sougarret cited the numerous “complexities” facing the Chilean copper mines.Chile supplies almost one-quarter of all copper production and, in past letters, we have discussed the issues plaguing their copper industry; in particular, declining ore grades, water shortages, labor issues, and uncertain fiscal regimes all negatively impacted production. Unfortunately, we do not expect any of these issues to improve going forward. Global copper mine supply contracted by 0.2% in the first four months of 2023 compared to last year, driven by disappointments in Chile.Meanwhile, global copper demand remained robust in both OECD and non-OECD countries. For the first four months of 2023, OECD copper demand increased by a robust 3.7%. Despite countless bearish articles in the financial press, Chinese copper demand continues to surge, with refined demand rising by 8% year-on-year.While China always dominates the headlines, we believe the pivotal element of Asian copper demand is India. We first wrote in 2018 that Indian copper demand was set to surge, very similar to China in 1999-2000. Even though few analysts have paid any attention, India’s copper consumption grew by almost 30% during the first four months of 2023 compared to last year. Global consumption in aggregate has surged 6% so far this year. Strong demand and weak mine supply continue to drive inventories to near all-time lows.Exchange inventories on the Shanghai, London Metal Exchange (LME) and COMEX fell from a high of 900,000 tonnes reached in 2018 to only 170,000 tonnes today. Although inventories are twice as high as the all-time low of 75,000 tonnes reached in 2005, production has grown by nearly 60% over that time. As a result, when measured in days of consumption, exchange inventories are almost as low as in 2005.Given the low exchange inventories and the bullish supply/demand trends, we believe speculators will soon panic much as they did back at the end of 2005 into 2006. Low inventories, combined with massive short covering, spiked copper prices higher by almost 200% in just six months. We are now potentially set up for a recurrence of that 2005-2006 copper price spike.Although we remain concerned about the universally bullish outlook adopted by the global metal analytic and investment community—a topic discussed in last quarter’s letter—we believe the rapidly tightening underlying fundamentals will push copper prices significantly higher in the next six to twelve months. For those investors that have exited their copper investments on global recessionary fears, we believe the copper’s weakness in the second quarter has given investors another excellent opportunity to increase their exposure.

18% Yield Potential At $100 Oil: Why Canadian Natural Is My Favorite Oil Play,"Things are developing very quickly - even quicker than I expected. Almost two monthsIn this article, I want to take things a bit further. As most of my readers will know, I've been bullish on oil for a while. Energy is the second-largest sector in my portfolio. I mainly focus on companies that are able to deliver high returns at elevated oil prices for one major reason: I want to protect my portfolio against prolonged above-average inflation.My thesis is built on two major pillars.These developments have caused a significant shift in geopolitical power and put a floor under inflation. Inflation in the U.S. is on the rise again, driven by energy prices. I expect this to hit core inflation as well over the next few months.Meanwhile, OPEC has witnessed an opportunity to use oil supply cuts to support prices. After all, with U.S. shale growth losing momentum, it can now impact prices much more efficiently.For example, even the Permian, the only major basin in the U.S. capable of significant oil price growth, is now seeing lower output, as declining legacy production is more than offsetting gains from new wells. While these numbers can rebound rather quickly, estimates are that the Permian will see long-term peak production in 4Q24, further putting a lid on U.S. shale growth.It started when oil was close to $80. Now, oil is north of $90 despite a significant decline in global economic growth expectations.Although I expect to deal with a number of oil price corrections along the way, my thesis is that once global economic growth rebounds, we'll have to deal with triple-digit dollar oil prices on a rather consistent basis.So, when I invest in oil and gas companies, I am looking for a number of key characteristics.In this article, I'll discuss recent developments that have caused oil prices to rally even faster than I expected. This includes the demand picture.I'll also elaborate on , which, in my opinion, is one of the best oil stocks money can buy.So, as we have a lot to discuss, let's get to it!Over the past few weeks, it feels that the bullish oil trade has become mainstream.According to :This is offering serious challenges for the Fed and the economy in general. The  reported that market participants are now hoping that $100 oil won't do much damage, as the risks of something bad happening to the economy are rising.According to the paper, the escalation of oil prices has raised concerns in both Washington and Wall Street about the potential disruption to the fuel-dependent American economy.This situation is reminiscent of past periods when surging oil prices played a role in pushing the country toward recession.The chart below shows that elevated energy prices have often started recessions.As oil prices approach $100 a barrel, there are differing opinions on the potential outcomes. While some expect prices to rise further due to supply constraints and geopolitical factors, others anticipate moderation in prices due to increased U.S. oil production.While oil production growth in the future can certainly keep oil prices from exploding, we are dealing with a post-peak shale environment, as I already briefly discussed.Furthermore, demand remains very strong.Bloomberg's energy expert  just commented on the outlook of the International Energy Agency (""IEA""), which is renowned for its global energy statistics but has a track record of inaccurate forecasts, according to Blas.In its upcoming World Energy Outlook report, IEA's Executive Director, Fatih Birol, predicts a peak in coal, oil, and natural gas demand before 2030.However, history suggests these estimates may not hold.Not only is an oil demand peak hard to predict, but it is even more unlikely that a peak will be followed by a quick decline in demand.According to Mr. Blas, historical consumption patterns, particularly in coal and potentially in oil, contradict the idea of a swift descent after reaching the peak.For instance, coal demand, assumed to have peaked in 2013, resurged in recent years, highlighting the unpredictability of demand trajectories.On top of that, OPEC expects to see oil demand growth until at least 2045.I agree with that, as I believe we have little understanding of what a growing middle class in India and rapidly expanding purchasing power in various African nations means for long-term oil demand.Going back to the IEA, this is what Javier Blas wrote (emphasis added):Having said all of this, I do not rule out an oil price decline to $80 again, as poor economic growth could harm investors' willingness to invest in cyclical assets.However, the moment demand comes back, I see no reason not to believe in a prolonged period of oil prices above $100.This brings me to the star of this article.My other favorite is Pioneer Natural Resources (), which I recently covered in an article you can .Canadian Natural Resources is currently my 6th-largest investment and one of my all-time favorites. I'm not just saying that to get catchy article titles, but because I completely stand behind every bullish thing I've ever said about the company behind the CNQ ticker.For starters, the company has massive reserves. CNQ is the only Canadian company with more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. The company has a 32-year total proved reserve life index and more than 10 billion barrels in proved reserves.Of these reserves, 60% are high-value synthetic crude oil, light crude oil, and natural gas liquids, which tend to come with great margins.With regard to production, in the second quarter of 2023, Canadian Natural achieved a production of approximately 1.19 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEs/d), which included natural gas production at about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day and liquids production at approximately 847,000 barrels per day.These figures were impacted by various factors, including wildfires in Western Canada, third-party pipeline outages, and planned turnaround activities.The wildfires caused temporary shutdowns of certain assets, but production has been largely restored.The company is also the second-largest natural gas producer.Having said that, a big part of the company's production comes from oil sands, which is very different from conventional oil drilling. This also has the massive benefit of no decline rates, no reservoir risks, and no reserve replacement risks. The company's oil sand assets have a reserve life of more than 40 years.It is also much cheaper to maintain these operations.The company's thermal  oil sands operations are breakeven close to $40 WTI. Most efficient drillers are breakeven at $50 WTI, which is already a remarkable number.The company's synthetic oil production is even cheaper, with breakevens between $20 and the mid-$30 range.Hence, it is no surprise that the company aims to expand these operations.During its , the company made clear that it is aiming for approximately 280,000 barrels per day of thermal production in both Q3 and Q4 of 2023.This represents a growth of around 30,000 barrels per day from 4Q22 levels, well-timed with favorable Western Canadian Select pricing anticipated for the rest of 2023.Thanks to efficient operations (low breakevens), CNQ is a cash flow monster. Even at $70 WTI, the company is capable of generating a free cash flow yield of more than 10%.These numbers aren't just great in general, but they also indicate the potential for accelerating shareholder distributions.Why?Because the company has the goal to return all of its free cash flow to shareholders the moment its net debt falls below $10 billion. With net debt between $10 and $15 billion, half of its excess free cash flow will go towards debt reduction.Analysts expect the company to achieve this target next year.Given the development of oil prices, I expect the company to reach this target in early 2024.This means that investors are in a great place to receive a total payout yield of 18% at $100 WTI. I feel like a snake oil salesman when I say this stuff, but it's true.Free cash flow potential is really this great, and a big part of the potential 18% return will consist of special dividends.The company has increased its base dividend for 23 consecutive years. Last year, the company's buybacks alone were higher than the total distributions of 2021. Total distributions last year were close to $11 billion.The company currently pays a $0.90 per share per quarter dividend. This translates to a base yield of 4.3%. Please be aware that I'm using Toronto-listed shares for this calculation. After all, the company distributes its dividend in CAD.On March 2, the dividend was raised by 5.9% after the company hiked its base dividend by 13.3% on November 3, 2022.Over the past three years, CNQ has bought back 7.5% of its shares.Going forward, I expect very juicy special dividends and accelerating buybacks, especially after the company reaches its debt target (likely) in 2024.This should also allow the company to keep outperforming its peers.Over the past ten years, New York-listed CNQ shares have returned 193%. This outperformed the Energy Select Sector ETF () by a wide margin. It performed its oil and gas exploration and production peers () by an even bigger margin.However, it failed to outperform the S&P 500, which is no surprise, as the biggest part of the past ten years did not have favorable conditions for oil companies.Going forward, I expect CNQ to outperform the S&P 500 and its peers.Valuation-wise, I believe that CNQ shares are extremely attractive. This is based on free cash flow potential at elevated oil prices.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article, including the potential of short-term pullbacks that I'm looking to use to further expand my CNQ position.The rapid developments in the oil industry have exceeded even my own expectations.My thesis rests on two key pillars: the slowing growth of oil supply, particularly with the decline in U.S. shale production, and persistent demand for oil despite the rise of renewable energy sources.These factors have resulted in a significant shift in geopolitical dynamics and provided a floor for inflation, particularly in the face of rising energy prices.While the possibility of oil price corrections remains, I firmly believe that once global economic growth rebounds, we can anticipate a sustained period of triple-digit oil prices. This outlook has led me to seek specific characteristics in oil and gas companies.I favor those with substantial reserves, low breakeven prices, robust balance sheets, and a commitment to returning free cash flow to shareholders, preferably through special dividends.One company that has all of these qualities is Canadian Natural Resources. With massive reserves, a diverse product portfolio, and a solid plan for shareholder returns, CNQ has become one of my top picks in the oil sector.The company's ability to generate cash flow at various price levels positions it for potential outperformance, making it an attractive investment opportunity.As oil prices continue to evolve, CNQ's potential for growth, buybacks, and special dividends could provide investors with substantial returns for years to come.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

"Marathon Petroleum: An Impressive Ascension, But It May Not Last Forever","The independent U.S. refiner and marketer, Ohio-based  (), released its second-quarter 2023 results on August 1, 2023. I have followed MPC quarterly since 2018. This new article  my article published on June 22, 2023.CEO Mike Hennigan said in the :Marathon Petroleum reported a better-than-expected adjusted income of  for the second quarter, compared with $10.61 last year.Net income was , compared to $5,873 million in Q2'22. Revenues decreased significantly from $54.238 billion last year to During the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum repurchased . The company authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase and has a remaining authorization of $9 billion.The company's operating income dropped significantly YoY due to the weaker-than-expected performance of its Refining & Marketing segment. The segment's Operating income totaled  compared with $7.13 billion last year, as shown below:Marathon Petroleum has outperformed Phillips 66 (), Valero Energy (), and VanEck Oil Refiners ETF (). MPC is up  YoY.Marathon Petroleum Corporation has outperformed the refining group over the past year. The main driver of this solid performance is that the company has strengthened its assets and improved its performance significantly, providing superior returns.Marathon Petroleum also owns a majority stake () in a midstream partnership called MPLX LP (). Most of Marathon's  is operated by MPLX LP. As indicated earlier, the , or R&M, is MPC's main operational segment.MPC has regularly outperformed MPLX on a one-year basis. On the other hand, MPLX LP is paying a higher dividend yield of As I said in my prior article, the company has shown exceptional performance in 2022, and with oil prices down in Q2'23 from a record high, it is normal to notice lower returns in H1 2023.However,  significantly from Q2'23, and refiners have done very well in Q3'23, with increasing margins.However, I believe all the goodies have already been factored in the stock price, and the sector looks overbought and ready for a technical retracement.Thus, trading LIFO for about  of your long-term position is prudent in case of a steep retracement happening at any time now.Keeping a long-term holding makes sense from an investor's perspective. As shown below, MPC pays a dividend yield of , which is not negligible but still a little low compared to its peers, with PSX leading the group.The total shares outstanding diluted has been reduced by  YoY.Marathon Petroleum declared a global R&M margin of  based on throughput per region.

However, operating income fell from the record Q2'22.The company reported an operating income of , compared to only $7,134 million in the same quarter a year ago. The significant decrease was due to lower YoY margins and refined product sales from a decreased capacity utilization. The refining margin was  per barrel in Q2'23, down from $35.54 a year ago.Capacity utilization in Q2'23 was , down from 100% in Q2'22. The year-over-year drop was due to planned maintenance activity in the Mid-Continent and West Coast regions.Throughput decreased from 3,145 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to .Finally, operating costs per barrel decreased to  from $5.19 last year.Below is the Refinery margins history:Marathon Petroleum's general and limited majority partners are MPLX LP. Segment profitability was , up  from $1,126 million in Q2'22.

"Chevron Buys Low, Exxon Buys High","Major consolidation in the shale patch continued with Exxon's () recent announcement to buy tier-1 Permian producer Pioneer Resources () in a $60 billion . As shown in the graphic below, Exxon was arguablyNote: Red Annotations By The AuthorChevron closed the $6.3 billion all-stock  on Aug. 7. Including the assumption of debt, the enterprise value of the transaction was $7.6 billion. Using Chevron stockWhat Chevron got for its money also was impressive:While PDC Energy owned 25,000 net acres and 28,000 boe/d of production in the Permian Basin, this deal was primarily a consolidation of the two companies' Denver-Julesburg acreage (i.e. the ""DJ Basin""):The graphic above was taken the Chevron's  and shows the extremely complimentary footprints of the two companies' DJ Basin leaseholds. As can be seen in the graphic, PDC held 275,000 net acres in the play and had 216,000 boe/d of low-carbon intensity production (zero flaring) in Q1, of which ~60% was liquids. On the , Chevron's CEO Mike Wirth said:It also was noted on that conference call that PDC had a very front-end loaded capital program this year - meaning the PDC assets will be spinning off significant free-cash-flow for Chevron during the second half of the year.Bottom line: PDC Energy was an extremely attractive deal for Chevron shareholders and gives the company a diversified and strong runway for growth in the DJ Basin in addition to the company's tier-1 position in the Permian Basin.Since the PDC deal closed on Aug. 7, almost two thirds of PDC's quarterly production will have been on Chevron's books for Q3. Per , current earnings estimates for Chevron's Q3 results are shown below:For Q3, the average earnings estimate is for $3.56/share. That would be down considerably from the $5.56 Chevron earned in Q3 last year when oil and gas prices were significantly higher due to the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine and the resulting breaking of the global energy supply chain. However, it would be an improvement from the $3.20/share Chevron earned in  when the company generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow.With the addition of PDC production, I suspect Chevron will announce Q3 production was well over 3 million boe/d. As far as I know, this will be the first time Chevron has quarterly production of over 3 million boe/d.For full-year 2023, the above earnings estimate of $13.89/share obviously bodes well for shareholders in comparison with Chevron's current $6.04/share dividend obligation. That is, I suspect shareholders will - at a minimum - receive at least the  that Chevron announced last January (along with its $75 billion stock buyback plan).Note that Chevron has delivered superior dividend growth as compared to Exxon over the past five years:That's likely due to Chevron's arguably superior management team and the fact that CVX has consistently held a much stronger balance sheet as compared to Exxon. That balance sheet strength enabled Chevron to raise its dividend in 2020 and make a well-timed acquisition at pandemic lows while Exxon was borrowing money just to pay its existing dividend. Over the past few years, Chevron has also proved itself to be a much more efficient operator as compared to Exxon.In addition, Chevron has been much more timely when it comes to making acquisitions. Exxon's ill-fated XTO debacle cost its shareholders dearly when the bottom fell out of natural gas prices and the XTO assets could not even cover the dividend obligation on the Exxon shares the company had issued to fund the XTO transaction. That transaction was a primary reason that Exxon's total returns for an entire decade were negative and led to institutional investors and money managers to support three Engine #1 nominees to Exxon's Board of Directors (see ).More recently, note that Exxon paid a rich price for Pioneer:The $25/boe Exxon paid for Pioneer's proven reserves is more than 3x what Chevron paid for PDC Energy and 5x what Chevron paid for the proven reserves of Noble Energy (less than ). In my opinion, EOG Resources () would have been a much better choice.Chevron remains my top pick among global super-major oil and gas companies. The company maintains a rock-solid balance sheet, has excellent growth prospects in the Eastern Mediterranean, Permian Basin, DJ Basin, and the Gulf of Mexico, is generating very strong free cash flow, and is shareholder friendly with excellent dividend growth and a massive share buyback program.According to the EPS estimates shown above, Chevron is expected to earn $14.77/share next year. A 14x multiple equates to a stock price of $200-plus (+18% from the current $169). Add in Chevron's 3.6% yield and investors can expect a strong 20%-plus return over the next 12 months while also protecting their portfolios from inflation and geopolitical turmoil.Chevron is a buy.I'll end with a three-year chart that shows Chevron stock consolidating a base around the $160 level. I would argue the stock is on the cusp of a breakout that will easily (and likely quite quickly ...) take the stock to $200/share. That is especially the case given the current geopolitical environment and the fact that, combined, Russia and Saudi Arabia are still holding millions of bbls of crude oil off the global market.

The Costs And Investment Implications Of Reshoring,"For the past three decades (and in some ways stretching back up to five decades), the U.S. has been in a relative industrial decline.More specifically, the share of the U.S. economy that has been involved with manufacturingWe can see this manifested in our structural trade deficit:And we can see it in our industrial production per capita:To some extent this is to be expected; as a country grows in wealth it tends to shift a bit more towards services, and begins to rely on developing countries to supply it with physical goods. However, a number of countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and (at least until their recent energy problems) Germany have been successful at maintaining largeThe challenge with de-industrialization is that an economy can become hollowed-out, and/or it can face national security issues during a cold war type of environment or during various logistical emergencies. In other words, it's just not just about access to plastic trinkets; it's about access to critical things we don't think about like medical dyes, military components, or even just basic tools that we use for everything else.So, the themes of ""onshoring"" or ""reshoring"" or ""nearshoring"" have become a hot topic lately, to some extent on the corporate level but especially on the federal level. It refers to the idea of moving manufacturing facilities back to the U.S. or to nearby countries, so that supply chains in general are shorter, less complex, and more resilient. And along these lines, various stimulus efforts have gone into encouraging a boom in domestic manufacturing.And it  showing up in the data. This chart shows annualized spending on the construction of manufacturing facilities:The U.S. used to run sub-$100 billion per year in manufacturing construction expenditure, and now it has more than doubled. That's tangible, even after adjusting for inflation.However, to provide context to the situation, the U.S. is currently heavily reliant on China's industrial base that is worth many trillions of dollars. So, this extra $100+ billion just puts us in the first inning here, if this is indeed to be the start of a reversal.For decades, the United States was a larger trading partner than China for most countries. However, by the late 2010s, China had flipped the U.S. in this regard, and it has only tilted further in China's favor since then:The ability to be the world's largest trading partner requires both making stuff and having the logistics to organize and ship that stuff. Along those lines, among the , seven are in China, one is in Korea, one is in Singapore, and one is in the Netherlands. To find the U.S. on the list we have to dig down into the top 20 and top 30 container ports.China now produces more steel than the rest of the world combined (and more than 12x as much as the U.S.):China is by far the world leader in solar panels. In terms of market share, they are more important for the global solar market than Saudi Arabia is for the global oil market.For rare earth elements broadly, which are widely used throughout the electronics industry including the alternative energy industry, China produces more than the rest of the world combined. In recent years, the rest of the world (ex-U.S.) has been regaining a minority share. Rare earth elements are not particularly rare, but they are found in low concentrations and thus tend to be environmentally destructive to extract and refine. Most wealthy regions don't want to deal with that.Just within the past three years, China's auto exports have hockey-sticked in terms of growth. Last year China surpassed Germany and this year they are  as the world's largest auto exporter. We don't see them in the United States but if you travel around the world, you'll see a lot more Chinese cars on the road than just a few years ago.Here in 2023, China also officially put their first commercial airplane () into service. The world now has the ABC's of commercial aviation: Airbus () of Europe, Boeing () of the U.S., and Comac of China, which was an  on their part to show their ambitions to compete on that level. Currently the main two are Airbus and Boeing, with Embraer of Brazil at a distant third (with less than a tenth of the revenue of either Airbus or Boeing).The introduction of Comac has been a 15-year development process that began in 2008 and is now live in 2023, and I suspect that over the next 5-10 years their commercial aviation capacity will ramp up like their auto production capacity has.When people describe the reshoring effort to bring some of that industrial capacity back to the United States, they usually just focus on the first order details: the manufacturing facilities themselves. ""It won't be old heavy industry"", they say. ""It'll be automated, additive manufacturing. This can all run much cheaper now.""And some of that is indeed true. 21st century manufacturing will trend in a more automated and additive direction than 20th century heavy industry did. But that doesn't mean reshoring manufacturing is trivial. The actual building of a manufacturing facility is the easy part; it's everything else in and around it that is hard.A recent  article """" highlighted an example:This comes right after TSM (), the world's largest semiconductor company that has been trying to bring production to the United States, reported delays until 2025 due to insufficient skilled labor. As  :That brings us to the second and third order details.  (e.g. manufacturing facilities) is just one part of the equation. We also need sufficient  to power it all, and sufficient  to install, operate, and maintain it all.To quantify some of the energy capital, or more specifically the electricity subset of that, China currently produces nearly twice as much electricity as the United States. Here are the annual numbers :In China's case as an example, the fact that they currently dominate the solar manufacturing supply chain isn't just because they have the right manufacturing buildings, although that's a part of it. Producing polysilicon is energy-intensive. Refining it into wafers is energy-intensive again. China uses coal power for the majority of this. But it's not just the coal- it's also the groundwater used in all of the cooling for power generation facilities, and it's the extensive electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure (which is very intensive in terms of steel, aluminum, and copper inputs).In other words, China has a lot of power capital, and they have been willing to pay the environmental costs of wielding that much power capital.In contrast, U.S. electricity production has been approximately flat for the past two decades (which is when our industrial production flat-lined as well, as we shifted these things increasingly over to China):The bright light in the U.S. energy landscape has been the strong uptick in shale oil production. The combination of new technology, a low cost of capital during the 2010s decade, and the willingness to operate at a loss with external financing, led to a rapid increase in U.S. oil production after a long decline of conventional production:However, shale oil production has fast decline rates, and the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. The cost of capital is higher now, energy investors expect a profit, and many pools of capital have divested from the industry. Going forward, it'll require more expenditure in order to maintain current or higher levels of shale production, and a lot of that expenditure will need to come from the industry's own profits.In terms of human capital, the past two generations in the United States have been incentivized to work in finance, software, and healthcare. As we have let our industrial capacity stagnate, it has to led to a stagnation in accumulated human capital for this area. It takes years to acquire sufficient technician skills to run these types of facilities. And much innovation comes from hands-on iteration; people working on the facility floor identify problems and propose changes to iterate the process and improve it over time.So, when we imagine the idea of U.S. reshoring, we must also consider the pathways of energy reshoring (which is expensive and comes with various environmental impacts) and skilled technician labor reshoring (which takes time to re-accumulate).In other words, rebuilding our industrial capacity is like turning a giant ship- it'll be a very big process. It'll require multifaceted capital accumulation, and various bottlenecks such as labor shortages or electrical requirements are likely to keep popping up in the form of unexpected delays and cost overruns as we try to re-accumulate that diverse type of capital.The prior decade and a half was mainly about intellectual/technical capital accumulation, including software, electronics, cloud infrastructure, and so forth. At the foundation of this era, the introduction of the consumer smartphone with a third party app store and extensive mobile bandwidth is what led to a massive runway of innovation and growth. That combination was a powerful set of building blocks for all sorts of developers to innovate quickly with, and will continue to be.This focus came at the cost of physical/industrial capital stagnation, at least outside of Asia. Our physical infrastructure aged, our power capacity stagnated, and the supply/demand balances for many types of commodities have tightened. These things do tend to go in cycles.I continue to view the next decade as a more . Even as tech like AI transforms the way we work and play, it won't change our need for significant physical investment in infrastructure and energy systems.As the world becomes increasingly multipolar, we should expect the positioning and fighting over natural resources to intensify. Achieving and maintaining ownership to key infrastructure, minerals, and energy production will likely become increasingly important.I share model portfolios and exclusive analysis on .

""It won't be old heavy industry"", they say. ""It'll be automated, additive manufacturing. This can all run much cheaper now.""And some of that is indeed true. 21st century manufacturing will trend in a more automated and additive direction than 20th century heavy industry did. But that doesn't mean reshoring manufacturing is trivial. The actual building of a manufacturing facility is the easy part; it's everything else in and around it that is hard.A recent  article """" highlighted an example:This comes right after TSM (), the world's largest semiconductor company that has been trying to bring production to the United States, reported delays until 2025 due to insufficient skilled labor. As  :That brings us to the second and third order details.  (e.g. manufacturing facilities) is just one part of the equation. We also need sufficient  to power it all, and sufficient  to install, operate, and maintain it all.To quantify some of the energy capital, or more specifically the electricity subset of that, China currently produces nearly twice as much electricity as the United States. Here are the annual numbers :In China's case as an example, the fact that they currently dominate the solar manufacturing supply chain isn't just because they have the right manufacturing buildings, although that's a part of it. Producing polysilicon is energy-intensive. Refining it into wafers is energy-intensive again. China uses coal power for the majority of this. But it's not just the coal- it's also the groundwater used in all of the cooling for power generation facilities, and it's the extensive electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure (which is very intensive in terms of steel, aluminum, and copper inputs).In other words, China has a lot of power capital, and they have been willing to pay the environmental costs of wielding that much power capital.In contrast, U.S. electricity production has been approximately flat for the past two decades (which is when our industrial production flat-lined as well, as we shifted these things increasingly over to China):The bright light in the U.S. energy landscape has been the strong uptick in shale oil production. The combination of new technology, a low cost of capital during the 2010s decade, and the willingness to operate at a loss with external financing, led to a rapid increase in U.S. oil production after a long decline of conventional production:However, shale oil production has fast decline rates, and the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. The cost of capital is higher now, energy investors expect a profit, and many pools of capital have divested from the industry. Going forward, it'll require more expenditure in order to maintain current or higher levels of shale production, and a lot of that expenditure will need to come from the industry's own profits.In terms of human capital, the past two generations in the United States have been incentivized to work in finance, software, and healthcare. As we have let our industrial capacity stagnate, it has to led to a stagnation in accumulated human capital for this area. It takes years to acquire sufficient technician skills to run these types of facilities. And much innovation comes from hands-on iteration; people working on the facility floor identify problems and propose changes to iterate the process and improve it over time.So, when we imagine the idea of U.S. reshoring, we must also consider the pathways of energy reshoring (which is expensive and comes with various environmental impacts) and skilled technician labor reshoring (which takes time to re-accumulate).In other words, rebuilding our industrial capacity is like turning a giant ship- it'll be a very big process. It'll require multifaceted capital accumulation, and various bottlenecks such as labor shortages or electrical requirements are likely to keep popping up in the form of unexpected delays and cost overruns as we try to re-accumulate that diverse type of capital.The prior decade and a half was mainly about intellectual/technical capital accumulation, including software, electronics, cloud infrastructure, and so forth. At the foundation of this era, the introduction of the consumer smartphone with a third party app store and extensive mobile bandwidth is what led to a massive runway of innovation and growth. That combination was a powerful set of building blocks for all sorts of developers to innovate quickly with, and will continue to be.This focus came at the cost of physical/industrial capital stagnation, at least outside of Asia. Our physical infrastructure aged, our power capacity stagnated, and the supply/demand balances for many types of commodities have tightened. These things do tend to go in cycles.I continue to view the next decade as a more . Even as tech like AI transforms the way we work and play, it won't change our need for significant physical investment in infrastructure and energy systems.As the world becomes increasingly multipolar, we should expect the positioning and fighting over natural resources to intensify. Achieving and maintaining ownership to key infrastructure, minerals, and energy production will likely become increasingly important.I share model portfolios and exclusive analysis on .

7-9%-Yielding Best-Of-Breed BDCs: Main Street Or Sixth Street?,"Two of the very best-of-breed business development companies, or BDCs (), in the market today are  () and  (). They both have significantlyIn this article, we will compare them side-by-side and offer our take on which is a better buy right now:Sixth Street Specialty Lending primarily invests in middle-market loans targeting U.S.-based companies. These companies typically have an EBITDA ranging from $10 million to $250 million, with the portfolio's average EBITDA at $67 million. Their portfolio is heavily weighted towards senior secured debt investments, with 91.9% of TSLX's investments being senior secured and 90.6% being first-lien debt investments. This makes them one of the most defensively positioned BDCs and - with 99.2% of the portfolio consisting of floating rate debt investments - they are well-positionedMain Street Capital's unique investment strategy, meanwhile, focuses on equity investments in the lower middle market portfolio, which they believe provides them with unique opportunities for net asset value growth alongside the generation of recurring dividend income. This strategy has paid off significantly, as since 2007, MAIN has witnessed a NAV growth of $14.84 per share (a 115% increase).Moreover, MAIN's internally managed operating structure offers significant operating leverage and a very low expense ratio relative to many of its peers, thereby increasing net profit margins for shareholders.MAIN's portfolio also benefits from strong underwriting performance. While 83.5% of the portfolio is invested in debt, 69.3% in senior secured debt, and 58.2% in variable rate debt as of the end of its latest quarter, only 0.3% of the total investment portfolio at fair value was on non-accrual status.Sixth Street Specialty Lending enjoys a solid  with a leverage ratio of 1.16x, fitting within TSLX's target range of 0.90x – 1.25x. On the liquidity front, TSLX has an undrawn capacity of $659 million on its revolving credit facility against $190 million of unfunded portfolio commitments, determined by the stipulations of their loan agreements. The debt maturity profile is also well-structured as the average life of investments funded by debt is about 2.5 years, while the liabilities have a weighted average maturity of around 4.1 years. This staggered maturity calendar reduces potential refinancing risks. Last, but not least, TSLX's investment grade credit ratings from multiple agencies such as Fitch, S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA further underscore its financial strength.Main Street Capital also boasts investment grade ratings from both S&P and Fitch, allowing MAIN to access debt at fairly attractive rates. With a very low leverage ratio of 0.87, a non-SBIC leverage ratio of 0.75, and an interest coverage ratio of 4.35,  appears to be in very strong shape. Moreover, it has roughly three-quarters of a billion dollars in total liquidity and a very well-laddered debt maturity profile:TSLX's net investment income for Q2 2023 was $0.58 per share, while the distributions per share were $0.50, giving TSLX ample coverage of its dividend. As management  on the latest earnings call:In addition to the positive outlook from the forward curve and its current robust dividend coverage ratio, TSLX's dividend outlook is also bolstered by the fact that the company's spillover income per share estimate is currently at $0.90.MAIN's dividend is paid out monthly, distinguishing it from many BDCs, including TSXL (which pays out quarterly dividends). Perhaps most impressively - especially given that MAIN has been in operation since before the Great Financial Crisis - the company has never cut its regular monthly dividend payout. Moreover, from Q4 2007 to Q4 2023, there has been a 114% increase in monthly dividends, while supplemental dividends amounted to $0.775 per share during the last twelve months. As a result, MAIN has a tremendous track record as a monthly dividend growth stock.Moreover, MAIN's dividend appears to be in very strong shape for the foreseeable future, with management  on their latest earnings call:MAIN also has a lower dividend yield than TSLX does, offering investors a 7.11% yield compared to TSLX's 9.21% yield.Both MAIN and TSLX are clearly high quality BDCs with impressive track records, well-built and high-performing investment portfolios, relatively strong and conservatively positioned balance sheets, and well-covered dividends. That said, given how much more expensive Main Street Capital is than Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., if we had to pick one of these stocks today, we would purchase TSLX. However, neither is cheap enough for us to buy in an environment where we expect economic conditions to decline and interest rates to be at or near peak levels, both of which should pose as headwinds to these BDCs. As a result, we are neutral on both of them right now.

RTX Corporation: The Best Defense Stock To Buy Now,"I've long had a defense segment in my portfolio. I expanded my defense holdings as the Ukraine/Russia war broke out. However, after an initial strong showing, their momentum died down. Demand for defense stocks died down, the upside potential appeared minimal, and I sold most ofI wasn't alone in selling defense stocks, as the whole market seemingly lost interest in the space. iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF () dropped by around 15% from its high in August to its recent low in October, just before the conflict in the Middle East erupted.By the time the October bottom happened, many high-quality defense contractors had become highly oversold technically and undervalued from a fundamental perspective. ITA's RSI crashed below 30, illustrating more significant oversold conditions than the bearITA's most significant holding, my favorite defense stock,  (), also known as Raytheon, dropped by approximately 35% from its high in 2023. Moreover, despite Raytheon's post-Israel/Hamas conflict rebound, its stock remains remarkably cheap.Raytheon trades at only around 13 times 2024 Consensus EPS estimates and 11 times 2025's expectations. This dynamic suggests that Raytheon should provide double-digit EPS growth in the coming years. Additionally, EPS estimates could be revised as demand for Raytheon's products increases. Moreover, Raytheon consistently surpasses EPS estimates, outpacing consensus expectations in  in the last five years.Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Raytheon beat its TTM EPS estimates by 29 cents (8.4%). 2024's consensus estimates are for $5.58. If Raytheon puts up a similar beat rate, it could earn $6.05 in 2024. Raytheon's stock is around $74 now, implying its forward P/E ratio is about 12. Also, Raytheon's consensus figures suggest its EPS could be $6.56 in 2025, but a similar 8% beat rate would put its EPS toward the higher end of analysts' estimates, roughly $7.11. This earnings growth dynamic suggests Raytheon should provide solid double-digit EPS growth in future years and only trade at 10.4 times 2025's anticipated earnings. Additionally, Raytheon pays a very healthy, growing 3.22% dividend.Aside from providing an excellent dividend, being exceptionally cheap, offering growth possibilities, and having a high probability of surpassing estimates, Raytheon produces some of the most innovative and in-demand products in the defense industry. Moreover, Raytheon's weapons could experience increasing demand as conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, and other areas continue. Raytheon operates through four primary segments.While Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense are considered two separate segments, I will discuss them as one for the sake of simplicity.Raytheon, a top aerospace and defense contractor, provides some of the  systems and services globally for commercial, military, and government customers. Raytheon  with the necessary firepower to dominate the air and ""own the skies.""Raytheon produces state-of-the-art market-leading air-to-air AMRAAM missiles and the Aim 9X, the most advanced infrared-tracking, short-range, air-to-air, and surface-to-air missiles worldwide. Raytheon also equips next-generation aircraft with advanced air-to-surface precision weapons systems. Raytheon offers advanced surveillance equipment, like the Global Hawk, and much more.Raytheon is also a global  weapons technologies, innovating and leading the industry in Mach 5 offensive and defensive systems that should provide growth opportunities in the new age. Raytheon also produces the highly popular and effective Tomahawk .Furthermore, Raytheon manufactures , a comprehensive missile defense system designed to detect, identify, and defeat tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aircraft, and other threats. Currently, the Patriot System is the foundation of the air and missile defense for 18 nations.Raytheon also services various industries through its Collins Aerospace Segment. Industries Raytheon services include airports, business aviation, commercial aviation, helicopters, military and defense, and space. The segment's most notable capabilities include autonomous operations, cabin experience, connected battle space, connected ecosystem, electrified aircraft, structural technologies, and more.I spent much of my life in Connecticut, so I know the Pratt & Whitney enterprise. It's headquartered in a neighboring town where I grew up. Also, my brother spent many years working at a competing specialized aerospace and defense part manufacturer, , in CT. Pratt & Whitney is a significant segment and is one of the ""big three"" aero engine manufacturers globally.It has  using its engines in more than 200 countries and territories, with over 85,000 engines in service globally. The company also has around 41,000 employees in over 40 countries, with  in sales in 2022. The segment also posted $1.3 billion in adjusted operating profits last year.Raytheon is significantly cheaper than other top defense contractors. While General Dynamics has a lower PEG ratio, its earnings growth seems less stable than Raytheon's, and the PEG ratio is skewed due to the minimal 3% EPS growth this year. Also, Raytheon pays a more significant dividend than its competitors, offering the best revenue growth and the most EPS growth potential. Therefore, Raytheon is the best buy amongst defense companies here. has a buy rating on Raytheon stock, with an average price target of around $90, roughly 20% above its current price. Moreover, the lower-end target range is $70, implying minimal downside. Furthermore, higher-end price targets go up to about $111, suggesting that Raytheon's stock could appreciate by around 50% over the next year in a bullish case scenario.Victor Dergunov is an independent investor and author with 20 years experience.

The Dividend Investor's Natural Gas Export Playbook - Part 3,"Over the next 5 years, a multitude of natural gas export terminals are scheduled to commence operations. This will expand exported volumes of liquified natural gas (LNG) from roughly 14 BCF/d to over 26.5 BCF/day by 2030. The first projects (shown below)are slatedA secondary round of projects that have reached FID will also serve to ensure these are not just one-off events. These supplementary projects will progressAs investors, this is an important market dynamic that can be captured for monetary gain. This can be done in several ways but also needs to be identified BEFORE the molecules start flowing.  focused on the producers of natural gas.  focused on the midstream companies that will transport natural gas from the well heads to the export terminals.Part 3 will be centered on companies that own the infrastructure that receives the process gas stream, cools, and compresses it to liquid form to load cargo. This cargo is loaded onto specially designed vessel at export terminals for international transport, mainly headed for Asia and Europe.LNG export terminals are the central theme of this entire series. They are the hubs that provide the rest of the world with cost-advantaged US natural gas. These terminals are no easy feat to develop. They cost billions of dollars and years to construct. To make matters more complicated, there are numerous regulatory approvals ranging from FERC to the DOE, to local states and counties that are potential road blocks to their eventual construction.As a result, the terminals that exist and are in operation today are extremely valuable than those that have only reached FID. These terminals have a valuable characteristic that all shareholders want....cash flow. Cash flow combined with the existing infrastructure opens the door for further expansion in a cost-effective manner while also lowering regulatory risk.Both of the companies discussed are still in growth mode. As a result, they are better suited for a dividend growth portfolio than for high yield. My top companies in this space are Cheniere and Sempra. Let's see what each company brings to the table.Cheniere is one of the most obvious choices to make this list with two terminals currently in operation and active expansion projects underway. Cheniere has both the Corpus Christi (15 Mpta capacity) and Sabine Pass (30 Mpta capacity) export terminals under its operating umbrella.The corporate structure of LNG is slightly unusual. The Sabine Pass terminal is owned and operated by subsidiary Cheniere Energy Partners (), of which LNG has a 50.6% ownership stake. The Corpus Christi terminal is owned outright by LNG. Therefore, from a simplistic point of view, LNG shareholders own a stake in 30 Mtpa of LNG export capacity, 15 Mtpa from each terminal.Corpus Christi (CCL) is currently expanding by building a Stage 3 consisting of 7 midscale trains. This will increase production by an additional 10 Mpta of capacity. This project is 38% complete with . This project is expected to place its 10 Mpta of capacity into service in late 2025 with full capacity being reached in 2026. This would boost the owned capacity of LNG shareholders by 33%.LNG has a full docket of projects under development. These projects include further expansion at both CCL and Sabine Pass (SPL).LNG has no plans to stop at 7 trains for Stage 3 at CCL. A bolt-on project will use the same midscale technology used in Stage 3 to construct Trains 8 and 9. The final two trains of Stage 3 are expected to add an additional 3 Mpta of capacity to the LNG portfolio, bringing the total CCL capacity to nearly 28 Mpta. Trains 8 and 9 have only entered the regulatory approval process and therefore should not be expected to be online until the 2nd half of this decade.To expand Sabine Pass, LNG is also developing an expansion project to add an additional 3 trains of liquefaction. This project will increase total production capacity from 30 Mtpa to 50 Mtpa. Pending regulatory approval, this project would make  in the world by leaps and bounds.LNG is designed to operate similar to a midstream operator, extracting fees under long term contracts for volumes processed and having minimal commodity exposure. However, there are a few caveats that investors need to understand when looking at LNG's financial statements:1. Revenue and expenses are tied to the change in commodity price. Both of these components fluctuate with the price of natural gas but higher revenue does not usually manifest itself in higher earnings. This is fairly common for midstream companies.2. LNG uses SPA (LNG sale and purchase agreement) and  to structure many of its contracts with customers. Accounting rules require LNG to realize the changes in contract value to reflect the change in commodity price. If you never heard of IPM agreements, you are not alone. Follow the link above for a quick and easy summary.In the following two images you can see how three major metrics shift drastically.1. The first image shows LNG's earnings per share fluctuating from a net loss of $10 per share to a profit exceeding $20 per share over a one year period. This doesn't look like a midstream company at all.2. The second image shows revenue and operating costs fluctuating by nearly $4 billion and $5 billion respectively on a quarterly basis. Furthermore, you can see that for the first six months of 2023, LNG's cost of sales was actually . This causes the reported earnings of LNG to be artificially high (reference the EPS of $20/share in Q1 2023).If taken at face value, LNG made $10.3 billion of operating income on $11.4 billion in sales so far in 2023. That obviously is not an accurate representation of reality. The traditional way of evaluating revenue and EPS growth just won't work here. We need to find a different metric that filters out the noise created by the changes in contract value.The company acknowledges this fact and makes the following disclaimer on all conference calls, most recently in Q2 of this year.To give an accurate measure of its cash generating capabilities, LNG reports 'net cash provided by operating activities'. This reconciliation process adjusts for the change in value of its derivative instruments (SPA/IPM contracts). Using this method, we can see that net cash provided by operating activities has held relatively steady between 1H 2023 and 1H 2022 despite a drastically different natural gas price environment. This consistent performance is more typical for a midstream model.Now that we have a usable metric, we can dive into how Cheniere is actually using its $5 billion in operating cash flow. Thus far in 2023, LNG has spent $788 million in stock repurchases, and $195 million in shareholder dividends, while investing $750 million on CCL stage 3 to advance the project. That leaves us with around $2.5 billion in excess at the halfway mark through the year. Management has thoroughly detailed how it plans to spend its discretionary cash flow in the quarterly conference calls.LNG has an incredible runway of opportunities for investors. With only $400 million in debt maturities in 2024, the company will have ample cash to repurchase shares while funding the construction of CCL Stage 3 and increasing the dividend. As Stage 3 enters operation, incremental cash flows can support financing other projects in the pipeline.Ultimately LNG is a cash flow powerhouse, but it needs some time to grow into its own shoes. By the end of this decade, volumes can grow by over 60% on an already high cash flow business. This cashflow can be deployed to retire debt and shares over the next 5 years. What will emerge, is a stable cash generation machine with a significantly improved debt profile as it prepares to enter the 2030s.With a yield of only 0.89%, some may be wondering how LNG qualifies as a quality dividend stock. For the investor looking to pay bills with dividends today, LNG may not be the right fit. For those who are looking at retirement in 5-10 years, or potentially longer, LNG will be approaching the transformation phase from rapid growth to cash distribution. I believe LNG has the potential to be a dividend aristocrat in the making.SRE is a utility company with operations mainly in California and Texas. Its California divisions are made of San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas). Texas operations are under the Oncor Electric Delivery Company. Finally, Sempra is rounded out by Sempra Infrastructure which includes its LNG portfolio.For the first half of 2023, the infrastructure division has accounted for roughly 30% of the company's earnings. Being that the remaining 70% of the company is related to electricity and natural gas distribution, those businesses will be outside the scope of this article. SRE is worthy of further due diligence.Sempra is less mature in the LNG game than Cheniere but has significant traction in the space. Anchored by the Cameron LNG terminal, SRE has a current export capacity of 12 Mtpa consisting of three separate trains. SRE owns a  stake in the terminal which is operated under a joint venture.Sempra is taking a more broad approach to LNG exports than most of the companies we read about in this space. It has two projects under construction, Port Arthur LNG in the Gulf Coast, and ECA LNG located on the west coast of Mexico.Port Arthur LNG has a projected capacity of 13.5 Mtpa, of which SRE will own a 28% equity stake. This terminal is projected to have Train 1 operational by 2027 and Train 2 operational by 2028. SRE has partnered with private equity firm KKR and ConocoPhillips to fund the construction of Trains 1 and 2. SRE's share of output capacity is approximately 3.78 Mpta.SRE is also advancing the ECA LNG terminal. Phase 1 of construction is scheduled to place 3 Mtpa in service by mid-2025. This project is coupled with the supporting GRO expansion project that will build out a 300-mile pipeline to support the ECA LNG terminal. The GRO Expansion pipeline is expected to enter service in 2H 2024 in preparation for the ECA LNG terminal to enter commercial operation.Sempra has several projects under development that will continue to expand its existing assets by building phase 2 projects at all three sites. The combined potential capacity of all three projects could exceed 30 Mtpa under current estimates. If these projects make it through FID and regulatory approvals, SRE would theoretically expand its export capacity by nearly 200%.Since this isn't a comprehensive analysis of all of the components of SRE, how does all of this impact the bottom line for SRE? Is it enough to move the needle for the entire SRE portfolio? To keep this discussion practical, I will only account for the projects under construction. The total net increase in export volumes from the ECA and Port Arthur projects can be expected to grow by roughly 6.5 Mpta or over 100% from its current capacity.Let's start by making the broad assumption that the infrastructure division is capable of doubling its earnings by doubling its volumes. To equate that to 1H 2023 dollars, infrastructure earnings could reach $1 billion or an increase of 30% for the entire company.At the end of the day, SRE is still a utility stock. The growth potential of the Infrastructure segment gives it a unique advantage over its peers. You can see from the graph below, that SRE trades generally in line with its peers. To be conservative, I will assume SRE's multiple shrinks to 16x. Assuming a 30% bump in earnings, the future price target of $79.87/share, indicates an approximate upside of 15%. All the while investors can collect the modest dividend yield of 3.4%.While this is significant, the bulk of SRE's planned investments are in its California and Texas operating companies which will continue to grow the other business segments. These businesses operate largely in a regulated environment and thus provide for consistent earnings growth.In an opposing fashion to LNG, SRE may be better suited for the more conservative investor looking to capture the growth of LNG exports that is built into a utility-style business model. SRE is a more diversified export play that will be a steady performer in your dividend growth portfolio.The largest risk to these companies (particularly Cheniere) is regulatory risk. A significant portion of the thesis developed here is based on regulators approving expansion projects and pipelines. Unfortunately, regulatory issues can be unpredictable once they hit a snag. Delays become costly to resolve, reduce overall project profitability, and test investors' patience.Should any of the projects proposed by LNG be unable to reach operation, the ability to be a significant cash producer will be hindered until it can work through its debt maturities. With over $9 billion in debt due by the end of the decade, LNG's priority of funding growth and share buybacks may need to moderate to service and/or retire debt.In SRE's case, I view the regulatory risk as higher because of the complications associated with exporting through Mexico. That higher risk does not carry the same impact, however. With only 30% of the company's profits deriving from LNG, and significantly higher investment rates in its regulated business segments, the overall monetary risk is lower to achieve a reasonable growth rate.In Part 3 of my natural gas playbook, we have explored two different companies that own and operate natural gas export terminals. Cheniere is a pure export play that has healthy cash flows coupled with a healthy pipeline of expansion projects underway or in development. The yield of 0.89% is meager at best. However, significant free cash flow will develop as projects reach commercial operation. LNG is an attractive dividend growth opportunity for investors on a multi-year horizon. These investors need to be willing to be patient to allow LNG to fully develop.My second candidate was Sempra, but only the Infrastructure segment was analyzed. It was shown that the current projects under construction stand to raise the company's earnings by 30% over the next 5 years. This does not factor in growth from the company's other three divisions.

Baytex Could Double With Minimal Multiple Expansion,"With a recent transformational acquisition, Baytex () looks well positioned to quickly pay down debt and deleverage at current oil prices. If it can accomplish that, the stock has a lot of upside with minimal multiple expansion.BTE is a Canadian based E&P with operations in both the U.S. and Canada. The company is primary focused on light and heavy oil.In Canada, the company owns 710,00 net acres in the Peace River, Peavine, and Lloydminster basins where it is focused on heavy oil production. These assets are expected to have about 37,000 boe/d production in the second half of 2023, with 95% of that liquids. The area has 142 MMboe of 2P Reserves and about 900 drilling locations.BTE also has another 440,000 net acres of light oil production in the Viking and Duvernay plays. TheseIn the U.S. the company has 182,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford with expected second half production of 92,000 boe/d of which 82% is liquids. It has about 900 drilling locations with 2P reserves of 440 MMboe.With a non-operating position in the Karnes Trough portion of the Eagle Ford, conventional wisdom may have been that BTE would have looked to sell the asset to focus on its Canadian properties. Given that investors have been pushing the company to focus on shareholder returns, such as dividends and buybacks, this seemed the most likely move.Instead, the company decided to double down on the Eagle Ford, recently closing a deal to acquire Ranger on June 20th. With Ranger, BTE added 162,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, with production of around 70,000 boe/d. Ranger shareholders received 7.49 BTE shares and $13.31 in cash in the deal. That valued the acquisition at around $2.4 billion, including the assumption of debt. The deal represented a modest 7% premium.With the deal, the Eagle Ford will become BTE’s biggest basin, representing about 60% of its production. The company sees the basin having 12-15 years of sustainable development, with modest production growth coming for 50-55 net wells coming online each year. It will spend $440 million bringing 32 wells online in the Eagle Ford in the second half of this year.With the deal, BTE also laid out a capital allocation program. After the deal, its net debt moved up to C$2.6 billion (or C$2.8 billion including working capital). Until debt is reduced to C$1.5 billion, the company plans to use 50% of its adjusted funds flow towards debt repayments and the rest towards dividends and buybacks. Once debt is below C$1.5 billion, 75% of adjusted funds flows will be directed towards buybacks and dividends.At $75 WTI, BTE expects about C$1 billion ($730 million) in free cash flow, while at $90 it's close to C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion). WTI is currently trading at over $87. At current oil prices, BTE should be able to get to its C$1.5 billion net debt target pretty quickly.The company also initiated a modest 9-cent CAD (6.5 cents USD) annual dividend. That equates to about 1.6% yield.On its  discussing the pending acquisition, CEO Eric Greager said:Of course, one of the biggest risks with any oil company is the price of oil. I’ve noted in other articles that I’m overall bullish on oil prices due to a number of factors, including that OPEC+ appears to be on the same page, China re-opening, a depleted U.S. strategic petroleum reserve that needs to be re-filled, and years of oil majors underinvesting in the sector. However, prices can move quickly lower if there is a bad recession or based on other geopolitical factors.For its part, BTE does run an active hedge program, where over the next year it has floor prices of $60 on oil and a ceiling of $95 or above for over 30% of its oil production. The company estimates that a $5 change in WTI can impact its annual adjusted funds flows by $218 million. A 50-cent change in natural gas only has a $15 million impact.Being a Canadian company whose stock trades in the U.S., U.S. investors also face currency risk. A weak Canadian dollar can eat into the returns of U.S. even if the company performs well.Meanwhile, while the Ranger deal adds a lot of scale in the Eagle Ford for BTE, the synergies from the deal could be more modest. Obviously, it will reduce corporate costs, but since its legacy Eagle Ford acreage was non-operated, operation synergies may be limited.The company’s Canadian assets, meanwhile, face differential risk, as Western Canadian Select generally trades at a discount to WTI and that discount can move around. The company currently expects a $17.50 differential in its assumptions. Extreme weather and events such as wildfires can also cause temporary issues that hurt production as well. BTE had to curtail 20,000 boe/d of production  due to Alberta wildfires.BTE trades at 3.2x EBITDA based on 2024 analyst estimates of $1.76 billion. Based on the 2025 consensus of $1.84 billion, the stock trades at a 3.0x multiple. Of course, the price of oil and natural gas can change the actual results immensely.BTE is valued in the low-end of the pack compared to other independent E&Ps.BTE made a nice move acquiring Ranger and should be able to quickly reduce debt and deleverage at current oil prices. This dynamic should give the stock a little more upside juice in the current price environment.If the company can reduce debt by $630 million over the next 12 months, and you put an under 4.5x EV/EBITDA on the 2025 consensus from there, you can get around an $8 stock. At $85 oil prices, the company should be able to generate about $425 million in free cash flow over the next six months.While oil prices need to remain solid, that’s a lot of potential upside for the stock from current levels with just minimal multiple expansion. As such, I’m going to start the stock with a “Strong Buy” rating.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Mobileye Global Inc Stock Oversold In Overreaction,"The International Monetary Fund  “Israel’s impressive (and remarkable) economic performance” in its short life. Its GDP is about $522M and the country enjoys a 4% growth rate or higher in many years. The Hamas conflict sparked a fall in share prices of Israel-basedWe recommend retail value investors consider our Strong Buy assessment because of the potential we forecast for Mobileye Global Inc. (). It is now Israel's largest company by market cap. The share price following its IPO nearly doubled to $48.11. On the eve of the war, Mobileye shares were still selling for $41.66.Our position is firm. Along with 22 other Wall Street analysts, we assess Mobileye deserves its Buy and Stronger rating with the share price pushed down by the winds of war. Mobileye shares recently rose +6% following the laudatory from a major investment firm that sees the next 6 to 12 months as a ""potentially catalyst rich"" period for Mobileye.Mobileye is a leader in the world of high-tech companies in which Israeli businesses excel.  accounts for 48.3% of Israel's total exports, amounting to $71B. High-tech exports have doubled every decade from Israel to foreign shores. 18% of the nation's GDP is from high-tech as is 30% of Israel's corporate .Battered chipmaker Intel Corporation () spun out its driver-assist subsidiary to raise $861M from the initial public offering. Mobileye’s stock price popped 34% from its opening. Intel  for $15.3B; its market cap today is $27.84B.Mobileye was formed by Israeli tech scientists to build emerging driver-assist technology for self-driving vehicles. We foresee the technology improving road safety, heightening the efficiency of aircraft and ships, and protecting soldiers deploying military unmanned vehicles. Millions of vehicles in over 800 models of cars worldwide have been equipped with its technology.Mobileye Global is moving from driving by sensors to driving vehicles based on cameras, radars, and LiDARs alone. If one ""system"" fails another activates as enforced as an independent backup; the system is  True Redundancy™.CNNBusiness.com claims management ""Its potential market could grow from $16 billion today to about $40 billion in 2026 and $480 billion in 2030 as it works toward ultimately developing robotaxis, which are fully autonomous vehicles.""Mobileye Global last reported earnings of its second-quarter results in July. The next earnings report announcement is scheduled for October 26 on numbers having ended in September '23. Expect some delay; since the war began; the call-up of reservists has pulled workers from jobs in every sector to the battlefield.In our opinion, the falling share price is not the effect of numbers due out soon but in Q4 and further out. Investors are anticipating the negative effects and have built them into the current shares. The share price plummeted to $34.56 to close the second week of October '23. Yet, the price is still +5.66% YTD demonstrating to us Mobileye's resilience and the confidence of investors in Israel's tech comeback. This might be a good time to acquire shares anticipating better earnings and revenue than the consensus as in the past:Note the growing annual revenue is partly due to the innovations and new products management  to the marketplace. 2023 and 2024 revenue estimates were made before the war broke out and actual numbers might be down. Mobileye Global's main offices are in Israel with marketing offices in New York and 8 other countries that can pick up the slack from war. Chips mainly come from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company () and Samsung and are shipped directly to customers. Business interruptions we believe will be at a minimum.We expect the Q3 EPS ending in September '23 to be $0.15 and $0.17. The share price will likely hover in the mid-$30 if the hot war does not significantly escalate beyond the lands of Israel and Gaza. The shooting might end in the next 4 weeks, because, any longer than that, we believe, will bring too much destruction to civilians, the economies, and the public image of the combatants. If we are correct, the average share price of Mobileye Global can top $50 over the next 8 months and might move to $70 of their future revenue, and earnings reports are minimally set back by events.Insider trading has not been a factor that retail value investors can consider. Insiders stocked up at the IPO but traded lightly since then. Intel sold all its shares in 2023 to generate cash for its organic operations. Between Mar '23 hedge funds reportedly owned 4.1M shares; in August '23 funds reportedly owned $4.8M but since then we have no information.Buying shares of Israel-based Mobileye Global is not charity but an expression of confidence in Mobileye Global's beamish potential to grow exponentially as a leader in the safety and scalability of autonomous driving. On the whole, Mobileye Global is expected to have high growth and profits at minimal risks which underpins our assessment that the stock is a worthwhile Buy and Strong Buy at the current oversold price.There are a few risks to consider. The largest company by market cap in the country during wartime faces like during wartime, team members are called to reserve duty. R&D production slips from collaboration that is interrupted. But nothing is manufactured in Israel by Mobileye, so the risk to revenue is minimized. The company does not pay a dividend, so for retail value investors to hold shares until the share price gets momentum may be stressful. Finally, the Beta of 0.95 suggests before the last 5 days the stock was somewhat volatile closer to that of the larger stick market. That might exacerbate over the next couple of weeks. Keep an eye on this stock as one that can drive a portfolio to new heights.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Airbnb: Pros Still Outweigh The Cons,"Once one of the hottest IPOs of , Airbnb () has since fallen from grace as all you seem to hear today is  about the New York regulations, high fees such asWhile there is some cause for concern, I still believe this is an exceptional business. With growing revenues, brilliant co-founders still at the company, and absolutely distinctive offerings, I am a believer and think this company will be a winner for patient long-term investors.Now, let’s dig into some details about this travel industry disrupter.Airbnb started out as a way for some roommates to make a few extra bucks. In 2007, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia began renting out space in their San Francisco apartment. They offered their guests an air mattress and breakfast, thus the ideaFrom these humble beginnings Airbnb has turned into a juggernaut in the travel space. As of the company’s , there are more than four million Airbnb hosts who have welcomed over 1.4 billion guests in more than 100,000 different cities across the globe.Speaking from personally experience, I love using Airbnb. It provides an experience which hotels often can’t provide. Many of the homes are unique and provide fun features such as bikes to ride, beach accessories and essentials for parents such as cribs and booster seats just to name a few. Our family has used Airbnb at least a few times every year over the last several years and I believe we’ll continue to use Airbnb for future travel.Airbnb has disrupted the travel industry and has become one of the most beloved and well-known  in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way consumers make travel plans and Airbnb was certainly one of the long-term beneficiaries. Even with the success the company has achieved over the last several years it is still one of most downloaded .Airbnb was a massive disrupter in the travel industry and they have numerous  compared to rivals. One key advantage is the number of listings on Airbnb. With a great number of options, consumers are more likely to find an option in their price range. Additionally, with Airbnb you can rent a ""shared space"" such as a room with a host. Many competitors such as Vrbo don't rent out such spaces.With more listings, travelers have more flexibility. Using Airbnb's search criteria it is easier to find hosts matching specific criteria such as those with last-minute cancellation policies or hosts that allow pets.Despite the large growth in the United States and Europe, Airbnb is still under-penetrated in most countries around the world. Airbnb has experienced recent success is many of these under-penetrated markets as Chesky gave two examples on the Q2 2023 earnings call. Germany and Brazil were underachieving countries but since the pandemic Brazil has doubled in size and Germany has grown by 60%. Germany is now on track to be one of the largest countries in the world on Airbnb.Chesky and team are hoping to bring that same success to Asia. The team is focusing on Japan and Korea first and I think there is a huge potential for growth in Asia Pacific. The hotel industry is 10 times the size of Airbnb so even outside of Asia there are significant opportunities for Airbnb to continue to grow the core business.Another opportunity is experiences. Chesky noted on the latest earnings call, Additionally, Chesky noted how AI could help the organization as well in the future. He gave a few examples such as an AI chat interface and an AI concierge which could match a customer to local experiences and local hosts across the globe.Competition is certainly growing in this industry, but I believe Airbnb’s moat is still intact as they have the first mover advantage. Airbnb’s offerings are unique, and many are one of a-kind such as the Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse. Airbnb partnered with the Barbie movie for this experience, and it has been a huge hit for Airbnb as it has become the most popular listing ever. These are the one-of-a-kind experiences you can share with your family and friends, and I believe Airbnb is a disrupter who will continue to provide consumers with more one-of-a-kind experiences.Brian Chesky is Airbnb’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. Follow co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk is the company’s Chief Strategy Officer. The last co-founder Joe Gebbia is currently Chairman of Airbnb.org which is a nonprofit helping to relocate those in crisis.Dave Stephenson is the company’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of Employee Experience. Stephenson has been with Airbnb for over four years. He’s previously held leadership positions at Amazon.As you can see from the below Glassdoor ratings, Airbnb is viewed as a good place to work, and the majority of employees approve of Chesky:I am a big believe in founder CEOs due to their propensity to focus on the long term. I believe this is a superb management team that has changed the travel industry while maximizing shareholder return.Recently Chesky has given some  in which he cites issues with the business and how Airbnb is working to overcome them. Some may view these comments as a negative but I view them as a positive for long-term investors. Many CEOs stick to sharing the positives and painting a rosy picture of the business. I like a CEO who can learn, adapt and improve the business.Thus far Chesky and team have shown they are willing to use profits to  in the business and make further enhancements. With a return on equity of over 40% and a return on invested capital of over 15% this team knows how to reinvest profits which I believe will ultimately reward the long-term investor.Airbnb’s growth has been impressive. As you can see from their prior 10K filing, the company has grown revenues and was able to turn profitable in 2022:This represents a three-year revenue CAGR of over 20%.In Q2 2023, revenue was $2.5 billion which is an increase of 18% compared to Q2 2023. Net income came in at $650 million which represented a net income margin of 26% and free cash flow for the quarter was $900, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. Trailing 12-month free cash flow margin was an impressive 43%.The company has a healthy balance sheet as of  as you can see below:The company has nearly $8 billion in cash and total current assets of roughly $20 billion which is enough to cover all of the company’s liabilities.Regarding key metrics for the business, in the  nights and experiences increased 11% compared to Q2 2022. Active bookers increased in every region. Guests traveled farther too as cross-border nights increased 16% compared to the prior year second quarter. Finally, guests are staying longer. 18% of all nights booked at for long-term stays.Airbnb also added a record number of new listings in Q2 as the company ended the quarter will over 7 million in active listings.Q3 2023 earnings are coming . Expectations are revenues will come in between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, which is implied growth of 14-18% percentage.  is $1.71 - $2.49 a share. Airbnb has beaten EPS estimates over the last several quarters and I expect that trend to continue.Even with rising rates, the consumer has been resilient. Consumption on goods may have slowed but consumer spending on such as vacations does not have appeared to yet. My expectation is that Airbnb will continue to beat estimates and deliver 18% growth, thus revenues closer to $3.4 billion. As mentioned above, Chesky has done recent interviews suggesting the core business needs to be improved. I expect to get further insights into how the team addresses such issues, such as higher costs. Additionally, I'm expecting to hear some comments about the New York regulations and further regulations. Lastly, I hope to hear continued improvements surrounding AI.There are certainly positive trends for Airbnb, but let’s now look at those some risks the organization is facing.Clearly the largest risk for Airbnb is regulation. Investors have to be concerned the situation in New York doesn’t snowball and more and more cities follow suite. No city currently makes up for that 1.5% of the organization’s total business and New York isn’t even the top three largest cities for Airbnb (those cities are Paris, London, and Los Angles). As a global business this diversification is currently helpful yet investors need to keep a close eye on regulations to see if more cities places difficult restrictions on Airbnb.Airbnb does have first mover advantage, but competition is heating up. The executive team needs to ensure Airbnb stays relevant and continues to roll out new features. Whether that’s with experiences or an AI concierge service as I’ve previously mentioned, Chesky and team will need think of ideas beyond the core business to maintain their dominant position in the industry.Seeking Alpha’s valuation grade for Airbnb is a “D-.”At 30X forward earnings Airbnb certainly doesn’t appear to be a cheap stock when compared to the median within the sector.However, compared to historical data you can clearly see Airbnb is much more reasonable.Airbnb had a massive  at its IPO date but the valuation was come down significantly. That it is not to say Airbnb is an inexpensive stock but it's far more reasonable for long-term looking to accumulate shares in this company.I think the three co-founders have created a stellar organization. Like Google before it, Airbnb has become a verb as this disruptive company has completely transformed the travel industry. Airbnb has over four million hosts, many with unique one-of-a-kind listings that aren’t be found elsewhere.However, the NYC regulations are certainly concerning for Airbnb investors and if similar restrictions begin to take shape across the globe, the organization would obviously be negatively impacted.The company also needs to continue to innovate and move beyond the core business to create a valuable experience for Airbnb consumers.I believe in these three co-founders as they have created an industry disrupter. Despite, the regulations enacted in New York and occasional damaging remarks on social media, I think the negativity surrounding the organization is overblown. The company’s financials are impressive and many of the company’s key metrics are moving a positive direction for the organization.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Union Pacific Q3 Earnings: Investors Take A Note, UNP Stock Is A Buy","The  is my third-largest investment and one of the first five stocks that I bought for my dividend growth portfolio.As most readers know, I've been bullish on the company'sOn July 26, I wrote an  titled In that article, I discussed the company's second-quarter earnings, the new CEO, Jim Vena, its ability to distribute cash to shareholders, and its valuation.Back then, the stock surged more than 10% after earnings, which was caused by the news that Mr Vena would take over from Lance Fritz.It's also caused me to remain cautious about UNP asSince then, UNP shares have erased the entire post-earnings rally.Having said that, UNP just reported its third-quarter earnings.As expected, revenue was under tremendous pressure from weakening economic growth. Pricing also suffered as lower energy prices caused fuel surcharges to drop.Due to these risks, the company massively reduced buybacks to protect its balance sheet.However, the company is upbeat about its future. It maintained its full-year guidance and continues to see market opportunities.While the economy is not out of the woods yet, I'm an aggressive buyer of UNP shares on any major weakness. It's not only a major holding of my portfolio but also of almost every portfolio that I advise.This earnings call confirmed my bullishness.So, let's dive into the details!One of the most important things to keep in mind before investing in railroads is how cyclical they are. While all North American Class I railroads are well-managed corporations (some more than others), none of them can escape cyclical downtrends.Union Pacific, for example, has a duopoly in the West with Berkshire-owned BNSF. It connects major economic hubs, ports, sellers to buyers in every supply chain imaginable, and goods transportation from the East to the West and the other way around.Having said that, the economy isn't in a great place. Economic growth is weakening, inflation is sticky, and rates are elevated and not expected to come down meaningfully anytime soon.The ISM Manufacturing Index, for example, has been in a downtrend since early 2020 and in contraction territory since the second half of 2020.This is the biggest reason why investors haven't been keen to invest in the company behind the UNP ticker.In these situations, I don't expect Union Pacific to grow its business. That's impossible, anyway.What I care about is operating efficiency, which could pave the way for outperforming gains the moment it benefits from rising demand again.In Jim Vena's first earnings call as CEO of UNP, the company reported net income of $1.5 billion, or $2.51 per share, compared to $1.9 billion, or $3.05 per share, in the same period of the previous year.Operating revenue decreased by 10%, mainly due to lower fuel surcharge revenue, reduced volumes, and a decrease in other revenue.Total freight revenue saw a 9% decline, driven by a 3% decrease in volume.However, intermodal volumes were down, driven by softness in the parcel segment and weak imports on the West Coast. Despite these challenges, Union Pacific's focus on business development yielded opportunities, such as winning wagon shipments from the Texas Gulf, which is an important tailwind in an otherwise expected intermodal demand downtrend.With that in mind, the other important financial number we need to discuss is expenses. After all, expenses are a major driver of operating income.As the overview below shows, expenses declined by 4%, causing operating income to fall by 17% (revenue dropped more than expenses, having a negative impact on margins). The operating ratio rose by 3.5 points to 63.4%.Compensation and benefits expenses decreased by $77 million, though it included a one-time labor charge from the previous year.Workforce levels increased by 3%, and active train crew personnel were up by 2%. Fuel expenses dropped by 25% due to lower fuel prices, and fuel consumption remained steady.Speaking of workforce levels, the company's operations improved, although it faced weather challenges but managed to restore operations efficiently.Key operational metrics improved year-over-year, including a 5% increase in freight car velocity, a 13-point improvement in intermodal trip plan compliance, and a 6-point improvement in auto TPC.These improvements are important, as services (in the entire industry) got so bad after the pandemic that it was even considered to let competing railroads use each other's rails.During the earnings call, efficiency metrics were also highlighted, with a 4% improvement in locomotive productivity and a 6% decrease in workforce productivity, reflecting volume declines and increased workforce levels.Right now, that's the price the company needs to pay in order to become more reliable.Having said that, the company's focus on train length paid dividends, with a 1% improvement in train length despite lower volumes in the intermodal business.Union Pacific's cash from operations for the year-to-date was $6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to the previous year, primarily driven by lower net income and labor payments.The cash flow conversion rate dropped to 72%.The company returned $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year. The adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased slightly from 2022 levels to 3x.Last year, the company returned close to $8 billion to shareholders.I'm actually glad the buybacks are down, as this allows the company to protect its A-rated balance sheet.This also shows that the company is protective of its balance sheets. Over the past few years, UNP has used some debt to buy back stock. This caused a lot of readers to drop the stock because of fears that this isn't sustainable.However, in the past, UNP used its extremely healthy balance sheet to buy back stock. Its debt was so low that it could afford to buy back stock using debt. Now, the company has become careful.Nonetheless, its 2.5% dividend yield is well protected. The payout ratio is 48%. The five-year CAGR is 12.2%. The most recent hike was on May 12, 2022, when the company hiked by 10.2%.Furthermore, over the past 10 years, the company has bought back a third of its shares, making it one of the most aggressive railroads with regard to indirect shareholder distributions.This also is one of the reasons why UNP has been a great source of wealth for countless shareholders. Despite regular corrections due to cyclical weakness, the company has outperformed the S&P 500 by roughly 40 points over the past 10 years.Going forward, the company is focused on maximizing growth opportunities, improving service, and generating productivity to achieve financial improvement, which is somewhat obvious.During its earnings call, the company also gave us a fourth-quarter outlook.In the bulk sector, challenges in the coal market persisted due to volatile natural gas futures. The company closely monitors grain exports, which are expected to increase with an improved service product capturing more available demand.Renewable biofuel feedstock demand remains strong, with new opportunities in Iowa, Louisiana, and Nevada.Union Pacific expects favorable conditions in the petroleum and construction markets, driven by business development efforts.Meanwhile, the premium sector faces challenges in the intermodal segment, while automotive growth is expected to continue, supported by strong OEM production.However, ongoing UAW negotiations and strikes could impact fourth-quarter volumes.Thanks to positive developments, the company was able to stick to its full-year outlook - despite poor economic developments.I believe that sticking to its guidance is the main reason why the stock is doing well after earnings. I would not have been surprised if the company had cut its guidance.UNP is trading at 19.7x earnings. Its 10-year normalized multiple is 19.0x. Despite this slight valuation premium, the company is, technically speaking, able to return more than 10% per year through 2025.This is based on an expected earnings recovery starting next year. Analysts expect the company to grow earnings by 11% in 2024, followed by an improvement of 13% in 2025.All of these numbers can be seen in the chart below.I believe these numbers could be much higher if the ISM Manufacturing Index improves.However, it also could mean that the stock price remains subdued if the economy remains weak. Inflation is sticky, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates soon, and pressure on consumers and businesses is building.While I do not expect a full-blown Great Financial Crisis-like recession, I'm still holding more cash than I usually do to capitalize on buying opportunities.So far, I mainly accumulated shares below $200. My plan is to keep doing this, although the odds of this happening are getting slimmer, thanks to UNP's strong performance.Investors who want to refrain from timing the market might be better off buying gradually. That way, if the stock falls, they can average down. If the stock takes off, they have a foot in the door.This is how I currently deal with every investment.The bottom line is that I will give UNP a  rating. The company is attractively valued and in a great spot to generate long-term outperforming returns.I expect that it will get help from cyclical demand growth in 2024 and beyond, further fueled by economic re-shoring tailwinds, truck-to-rail conversion benefits, and secular growth in commodities and export opportunities.It's truly one of my favorite dividend growth stocks.My outlook on Union Pacific remains as bullish as ever. Despite facing challenges like weakening economic growth and rising costs, the company's commitment to efficiency, shareholder distributions, and maintaining its full-year guidance during uncertain times reflects its strength and resilience.UNP's long-term performance has consistently outperformed the S&P 500, making it a valuable asset in my dividend growth portfolio.While the road ahead may have its share of bumps, the company's favorable valuation, growth prospects, and potential for outperforming returns keep me optimistic.As we look forward, the key drivers to watch are the ISM Manufacturing Index and the broader economic landscape. I continue to accumulate UNP shares on dips, believing in its potential to benefit from cyclical demand growth and other favorable industry trends.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Devon Energy: You Might Think,"There is no justice in the oil patch these days. Good companies, supplying badly needed products to a ""thirsty"" market are getting pounded out by the financial markets. There really has been no safe haven for holders of shale relatedOn this platform,  () has been taken out to the woodshed relentlessly over this period. DVN is one of the cornerstones of our portfolio, and as of today, it's down 30% YoY, and about 40% from its peak in late October of last year. Honestly Now, DVN isn't alone in this slow-rolling freight train of capital annihilation, but it's fared worse than rival Pioneer Natural Resources (), down from $252 a year ago, to $215 at the close today-say 12%. )Ok, getting back on track here as regards Devon. In another case, EOG Resources () is down 12-13% to $119 from 145 a year ago. So it makes me wonder, what about DVN singles it out for such a pounding by the market?In this article, we will review some pertinent aspects of this beleaguered energy giant, and see if we can justify our continuing to hold the stock, and perhaps buy more at these distressed levels.You would be wrong, although there is a caveat to that statement we will discuss. As a nominal oil producer, the first thing  is that their wells are running dry and they are running out of good drilling locations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Devon is turning in some great wells with IP-30 rates three and four times the official new well average quoted in the . With a key acquisition of , DVN picked up some of the best rock in the Permian basin, which it has been developing since.In past articles, I've extolled the wonders of the Permian Basin, and in particular the multi-tiered, Upper and Lower Bonespring, and Wolfcamp A, B, C, and D in the Delaware sub-basin that is powering national shale production ever so incrementally higher. Here is a  to my earlier articles on Devon, which you can access for a deeper treatment of the Permian than I will do at this point.Here is  from Clay Gaspar, President of DVN pointing out recent successes on Delaware projects:In a recent internal article on Occidental Petroleum (), we discussed how shrewd operators are extracting Tier I results out of what would nominally be Tier II intervals-Wolfcamp B as an example. What Gaspar is describing with the Wolfcamp B is just that-Tier I performance. Deeper, with higher pressures, perhaps lower Total Organic Carbon-TOC's, and tending to be gassier than the upper ""A"" zone, without the elixir of technology, these new "","" might not exist. Gaspar goes on-If a company drills four hundred wells a year, a 9% increase in efficiency delivers 40 additional wells. For free. Ok DVN is making great wells. Let's move on.Certainly not. Across all of their shale portfolio, production is up 7% YoY. The Delaware decline YoY is probably explained by increasing gas production from the Wolfcamp B. That was the caveat, by the way, and a likely source for some of the pain the market has inflicted on the company. For those who are new to my work, here's a point I haven't covered in a while. Thermally, the  begins to convert to gas and gas liquids as wells become deeper and as a consequence-hotter. Deep and hot gets you dry gas.So, declining production is not the answer. One final point in regard to the Eagle Ford, the Validus acquisition is paying dividends in raising the oil content of DVN's daily output. In past articles, I've shown the EIA map of the Eagle Ford, I'll just link it . Give it a look and you can see DVN's showcase development on the Butler pad is right on the southern flank of the oil and gas condensate rich section of Karnes county. As of now, of the  looking for oil, 44 of them are in the Eagle Ford.Clay Gaspar details the results of their exploration work in the Eagle Ford-The Butler unit was part of the package that came with Validus. Something I've harped on-consistently, is rock quality matters above all. Sure, DVN spent a couple of billion to get this bolt-on to their existing acreage, but it is yielding impressive results.So they are increasing production and increasing the oil-cut of the same. What's next?Yes they are. Great gobs of it... but revenues and margins are down. And now we begin to understand at least part of the reason why DVN has gotten whacked by the market. , DVN logged gross revenues of $3,365 bn, down sequentially from $3,584 in Q-1, and a big step down from $5,794 the year prior. Oil prices down by nearly half and gas dropping to ~$2.00 MCF explains the drop. DVN still managed to generate $1,575 bn of EBITDA, $1,405 bn OCF, and Free Cash of $690 mm for the quarter. This covered the fixed and variable to the tune of $0.49 per share, or a dividend expense of $313 mm for the quarter.Their operating margin-OM, for the quarter fell to 43.95%, an 18% drop QoQ, and a big step down from the 63.33% OM recorded in . I chose Q3 for comparison as it shows what the decline in gas has meant to DVN. For reference, though, PXD OM for Q-2,2023 is also 43%, so DVN is not necessarily underperforming competitors as oil and gas prices have slumped through Q-2.Let's look at another metric, Return on Capital Employed, or ROCE.On ROCE DVN outperforms PXD. The company claims more than 20% in the slide deck for the quarter. My calculation shows 31.16% on TTM basis, so we will run with that.What has been perceived as dividend cuts since Q2, 2022 have absolutely . I've made the point before that the company has stuck to their capital returns model, where 50% of free cash goes to dividends and share repurchases, but it hasn't mattered. Nor has it mattered that other shale high dividend payers have also moderated their payouts as cash flow has declined over the past year. In each case, in conjunction with or slightly in advance of the announcement, fickle investors have voted with their feet.The company expects to place online around 90 gross wells in the third quarter, with capital spending expected to approximate $900 million. The decline in capital spending is driven by the drop of a temporary frac crew in the Delaware Basin and efficiency gains that accelerated completion activity into the first half of the year. This level of activity is expected to drive oil production to a range of 322,000 to 330,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.Increased production at a time when oil prices are surging and gas has recovered from off the bottom should add meaningful cash flow and bump up the margins.It's been tough sledding for DVN the past year as we have discussed. My expectation is they will turn the corner with their Q3 earnings announcement that will come o/a the First of November. EPS is expected to come at $1.46 per share, a 20% bump from Q2. If they hit that target, free cash should be back in the ~1.0 bn range. Half that, minus the fixed at $0.20 or $127 mm leaves $322 mm for the variable or about $0.51, making the total payout $0.71 per share. With forecast EPS of $1.61 for Q4, the pot should continue to get fatter.We should also mention DVN's aggressive stock buybacks, bringing value to shareholders.  on the timeliness of these buybacks-It should go without saying...almost, that as the float declines more cash is available for future distributions.Right now Devon Energy Corporation is trading at a paltry 2.1X NTM estimated EV/EBITDA. That puts it squarely in a buy zone. Investors looking for growth and income should definitely consider DVN at current levels. If I am half right, these prices aren't going to stick around long. I will probably add to my position tomorrow.Fluidsdoc is an international oil industry veteran with 40 years of experience having worked on six continents and in over twenty countries around the world.

ZIM Integrated: The Bottom Is In (Rating Upgrade),"ZIM Integrated Shipping Services () has suffered a brutal valuation decline in the last twelve months with shares down 57%. While I was previously cautious with regard to the container company, I now believe that ZIM Integrated Shipping’s shares may haveI have issued a number of sell ratings for ZIM Integrated Shipping Services, largely due to the devastating decline ofThe single biggest catalyst for ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' revenue growth and free cash flow is shipping rates. Shipping rates have fallen precipitously after the pandemic but have seen a bit of a recovery lately. Shipping rates for a 40-foot container rose from ~$1,500 per container in July to $1,800 per container in August, according to the Drewry Container Index which measures shipping costs. The uptick in rates is likely to have a positive impact on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' Q3 earnings potential and for this reason, I would expect a number of upward EPS revisions, not only for Q3 but also for FY 2023.Although shipping rates in recent weeks have fallen back to $1,500 per container, shipping rates are still 20% above pre-pandemic levels. The drop in shipping rates, of course, affects the entire industry and not just ZIM Integrated Shipping Services.According to the  from September 2023, the organization expects global growth to moderate from 3.0% in FY 2023 to 2.7% in FY 2024, but export-focused countries like China are expected to grow significantly faster. Moderating inflation is also a big reason why I believe the economic reality going forward could look much more resilient than investors think.Investors are slightly more optimistic today than they were last month about the possibility of a recession hitting the global economy next year. To be clear, analysts still expect a recession to manifest by August 2024 and according to  the odds of such a recession are currently 60.83%. But they are also down from 66.01% in August, which is likely a reflection of moderating inflation.Besides freight rates in the spot market, the most important figure to watch going forward will be ZIM Integrated Shipping's free cash flow. While the company lowered its adjusted EBITDA outlook for FY 2023 (to $1.2-1.6B), the shipping firm still managed to pull in $321M in positive free cash flow in the second quarter, despite a depressed pricing environment. In the past, ZIM has paid a generous dividend to shareholders which was the main appeal for investors to buy the stock. However, I expect ZIM to completely suspend its dividend in FY 2023 which would fundamentally improve the firm's free cash flow/liquidity position. At the end of the second quarter, ZIM had more than $1.0B cash in the bank plus $863M in other investments.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is projected to lose $4.35 per share but estimates for FY 2024 show that analysts don't expect the situation to get much worse. FY 2023, however, is not going to be a great year as consumer demand remains weak and the global economy is still under the influence of high interest rates, a post-pandemic slowdown in shipment volumes, and materially lower shipping rates.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' key metrics like revenues, free cash flow, and net income have already fallen back to pre-pandemic levels and the firm may be able to avoid a more severe earnings contraction altogether.ZIM is currently valued at 0.25X FY 2024 revenues which is about 38% below the 1-year average P/S ratio. Since the shipping company is expected to lose money this year, a P/E ratio cannot be applied. However, ZIM is now much cheaper than shipping company Maersk (). Assuming ZIM could earn $2 per share in FY 2025, and applying a 10X P/E ratio, the shipping company could trade at $20 in the longer term.The biggest risk for ZIM Integrated Shipping Services, obviously, is a drop in container freight rates which would immediately limit the company’s free cash flow recovery potential and worsen its liquidity situation. Another risk is the growth trajectory of China, an export country, which is suffering a weaker-than-expected post-pandemic recovery in its economy. Slowing growth in China, potentially driven by falling consumer spending and exports, could be a catalyst for shares of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services to achieve new lows.While I have been bearish about ZIM Integrated Shipping Services due to the possibility of a severe earnings contraction, I believe that the market situation as well as risk profile have recently improved, in part due to some recent upside momentum in shipping rates. With decreasing odds of a global recession and an August rebound in freight rates, I believe there is a good chance that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services’ shares have bottomed out... and that ZIM has surprise potential for Q3. While the company still needs upside impulses to lift shares into a new up-leg, there is a good chance that moderate growth in the global economy next year could prevent a severe earnings contraction.

Marathon Petroleum: Elevated Crack Spreads And Share Repurchases Make This Attractive,"Marathon Petroleum () was started in 1887 with the combining of several smaller oil companies in the Lima, Ohio region. When the company combined, the new company was called the Ohio Oil Company and was foundedBy 1888, Standard Oil already controlled most of the Lima Oil Field and was the primary company that transported oil from the Lima Oil Fields to Chicago and other cities. In 1889, like it did with so manyFast forward to 1911, when the Standard Oil Company was broken up thanks to the anti-trust laws at the time. The separation finalized in 1913 and The Ohio Oil Company was once again an independent company.In 1930, The Ohio Oil Company acquired the Transcontinental Oil Company which had a brand name called Marathon with a slogan that stated, ""The best in the long run."" The 1940s and 1950s was a very innovative time period for oil and gas companies and The Ohio Oil Company was one of the leading companies in innovation and then in 1962, the company officially changed its name to the Marathon Oil Company.Up until 2011, the Marathon Petroleum Company operated upstream assets as well as downstream assets. However, in 2011, the company chose to spin off its upstream assets into a separate company called the Marathon Oil () and became named the Marathon Petroleum Company. Therefore, Marathon Petroleum Company only consists of downstream assets such as refineries and pipelines, today.The outlook for the refining business remains very strong through 2023. In 2022, the business experienced some of the highest crack spreads in recent history. You can see below that the spreads jumped over $1.20 when historically, they hover around $.40.The EIA, for what it is worth,  that crack spreads will normalize once again over the coming years. Their forecast for after 2023 is shown after the gray dotted line. Will this happen? I would be skeptical if this can return to what it was prior to the pandemic but time will tell.Here is what crack spreads have actually done throughout 2022. Throughout 2023, crack spreads have remained elevated in the range of $.80 per gallon.The EIA forecasts that refinery utilization will remain in the 90 percent range in the future, just as it has in the past. In other words, the industry is operating at full capacity and there isn't going to be any meaningful new refining capacity coming online any time soon. In 2022, Biden approved a large export terminal for the Gulf Coast, but it doesn't appear there is new refining capacity, only the ability to .The last, large scale refinery to come online was in 1977 and was the Marathon refinery in Garyville, Louisiana. It came online with 200,000 barrels of capacity and has around 600,000 barrels per day of capacity today. Since then, no new refineries have opened that produce greater than 50,000 barrels per day. New refining capacity does not appear to be a threat to Marathon's business.Marathon's business remains strong. I would say the industry and Marathon are well-positioned for the future. Given the regulatory environment that is engulfing the oil and gas industry, it should provide large refiners like Marathon with a competitive moat for years to come.Since spinning off the Marathon Oil Company, MPC has operated with anywhere between 500 to 600 million shares outstanding. For the past two years, the company has been aggressively buying back shares. This is going to continue to be a bullish signal for Marathon. In 2019, the company had about 664 million shares outstanding. Today, the company has reduced that by over a third, down to roughly 400 million shares outstanding. They were able to reduce shares since the end of 2022 from above 500 million, to where it is today. Year-to-date, as of this writing, the company's shares are up over 30 percent.This has been a good strategy for the growth of the share price. However, with interest rates continuing to rise, I would think that capital deployed towards share repurchases becomes a much less effective use of capital and that at some point, it will become more strategic to either strengthen the balance sheet, or find stronger capital projects to invest into.That said, Marathon has a relatively strong balance sheet as most of their debt comes from their holdings of their midstream company, MPLX (). They own 64 percent of the shares in MPLX.Here is Marathon's debt-to-asset ratios over the past 5 years. With some senior notes coming due in 2024 through 2026 (slide above), it will present good opportunities to deleverage the balance sheet, especially if interest rates continue to rise.Here you can see that Marathon is able to operate at a 93 percent utilization rate indicating strong demand remains for refining and that Marathon is operating efficiently despite having significant maintenance downtime in the quarter. This dovetails with the industry outlook above, demonstrating that despite the regulatory monster, demand remains strong.Strong crack spreads combined with Marathon's established refining and marketing business creates a strong position for Marathon. Much of how their stock will perform will depend on crack spreads going forward, but with their midstream assets providing some level of diversification, I believe Marathon represents a good value. Crack spreads have remained elevated through 2023 so far and so it represents a risk of buying while crack spreads are high. However, they have remained elevated since 2022 and perhaps this is the ""new normal"" as many things have remain changed since 2021.That said, Marathon's shares have had a very good run in 2023 and it might be prudent to wait for a pull-back in the share price, or dollar-cost average.Overall, Marathon is a good way to gain access to downstream assets if you believe this is the best way to position yourself to the energy industry. However, I also prefer upstream assets  () as they represent greater  in my opinion. The downstream refinery business' source of growth will be more at the mercy of crack spreads as it is difficult to bring new refining capacity online in this regulatory environment. And with a dramatic shift continuing in the transportation industry towards electric vehicles, greater refining capacity may not be an extremely prudent investment. There are a lot of variables to consider at the moment but nothing is going to change so quickly to take away Marathon's current and long-term strategic position inside the energy industry.

"Above The Noise: So Long, September. Strikes, Shutdowns And Social Security","We made it through August and September! Readers of Above the Noise know that I say that with sarcasm. The media is happy to remind us each year that stock markets have had historicallyNow, stocks were in fact challenged over the past two months, but I’d attribute this year’s August and September downturn to too-strong US growth and higher rates rather than anything specific about the calendar.Nonetheless, if you care about this sort of thing, we are now entering what has historically been the best two months for stocks. Either way, investors whoPersonally, I’ll continue to focus on the big questions rather than the date on the Gregorian calendar. Speaking of which…We start with three simple questions.Historically, it has taken roughly 12 to 18 months for the impact of interest rate hikes to be felt on the US economy. A year ago, the Fed Funds rate was 2.50%. Eighteen months ago, it was 0.25%. Give it time. The slowdown in the economy is still ahead of us.Financial markets (over the past three months) and global central banks have revised their respective assessments of near-term recession probabilities, as reflected in favorable asset returns and recent upgrades to economic outlooks. Our research indicates that the odds of a recession in 2023 are minimal, and that economic resiliency should persist through the end of the year.Is a Federal Reserve rate hike in play for November? Regardless, the Fed Funds futures market suggests that the end of tightening is near.A backdrop of economic resilience and improving risk sentiment (over the past three months) has us favoring risk assets over the remainder of the year, if not into 2024.We favor credit over Treasuries as well as cash-like instruments. Within equities, we overweight cyclical factors with high operating leverage and a higher sensitivity to a rebound in growth expectations, such as value and smaller capitalization stocks.From a regional perspective, we remain overweight emerging markets, supported by improving risk appetite and expectations for US dollar depreciation.… today, as in the past, I expect another late cycle rise in oil and gasoline prices to have a deflationary impact on the US economy, rather than result in higher inflation and further policy tightening.Energy prices surged going into the recessions of 1991 and 2008 also. Back then, the increase in gasoline prices lifted headline US Consumer Price Index (as it did again this August), but it cut into real consumer income just as the consumer spending was already slowing.It feels like déjà vu all over again. I’d expect the rise in energy prices to again serve as a “tax” on the consumer rather than the impetus for additional policy tightening.""When we come back, we're not going to leave. We're going to get this done. Nobody wins in a government shutdown.” – Kevin McCarthy, Speaker of the US House of RepresentativesGet out the popcorn! The House speaker appears willing to move ahead with a short-term spending bill, despite threats from members of his party that such a move would result in a floor vote to remove him.Personally, I’ll be watching with faint interest as these things rarely matter much to the economy or to the financial markets. Here’s some things to know to prepare you for the showdown.The European Central Bank (ECB) continues to raise interest rates even as the economy is slowing. Is this the next “Trichet” moment, when the European Central Bank under President Jean-Claude Trichet raised interest rates on the eve of a financial crisis? I posed the question to Arnab Das, Global Market Strategist-EMEA at Invesco.His response:Q: Doesn’t Social Security run out of money by the middle of the next decade?A: No. The Social Security trust fund will have been depleted by the middle of the next decade. From there, the US will pay out what it collects in payroll tax revenue.It is expected that retirees would then receive roughly 80% of benefits, although I would expect politicians to act to ensure Social Security’s long-term viability.This would include similar action taken by the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, such as increasing the taxable maximum, altering the cost-of-living adjustments, or raising the retirement age, to name a few. How will the auto strike affect the US economy? There are a few potential concerns:However, strikes have not historically lasted for very long. The United Auto Workers union has a finite strike fund in which to provide strike pay. Additionally, most domestic car manufacturers have ample supply, and the used car companies have rebuilt their fleets. Supply has increased at a time when consumer demand is slowing. As a result, any upside move on inflation would likely be very limited.David Nadel joined the Greater Possibilities Podcast to discuss the misperceptions investors have about small- and mid-cap international (SMID) stocks and where his team sees opportunities in this often-overlooked space.Among his insights:My travels this month took me to Detroit, a homecoming of sorts for this University of Michigan graduate. Let’s just say I’m not surprised to hear businessman Dan Gilbert proclaiming “Detroit is back” and rock star Alice Cooper declaring Detroit to be “the coolest place around.”A mere 10 years after becoming the largest municipality to declare for bankruptcy, the city has a great combination of new hotels, restaurants, stadiums and arenas, and apartments.Challenges remain but the progress is great. Anytime the company needs me in “the 313” for an investment conference, I’ll be happy to get a great meal in Detroit’s Corktown Historic District and to take in a Tigers or Red Wings game.See you next month.

More Shades Of 2007,"There are plenty of nefarious phrases in the English language. One of my personal favoritesHowever, perhaps the most dangerous phrase or canard for investors has to be ""."" As I highlighted in my article """" in mid-August, we are about to enter a period of more turbulent equity and credit markets. And as Mark Twain famously quipped "".""My thesis from that initial article was that 2023 is starting to look likeNow, I don't see the same such dire scenario playing out this time around, it should be noted. I have the coming pullback in the markets being somewhere between the 2008/2009 meltdown and the  of 2013, when the Federal Reserve had to back off of raising rates due to the turmoil in the markets they were starting to cause. However, I am looking for at least a 20% pullback in the S&P 500 () from peak to trough before things start to stabilize in the markets.I took out quite a bit of "" in the form of long-dated, out-of-the-money  mainly against the   and the   during June and July, when the  was trading in the 12-14 range. Thanks to the recent selloff, the VIX is trading just below 20 as of Wednesday morning.As it happened, my initial article came out right around the same time as the S&P 500 was peaking just above the 4,600 level. As of pre-market Wednesday, the S&P 500 was trading right around 4,280, down just over 7% from its all-time highs set on the last day of July. So, I am one-third the way to my projection coming true.Now, 2023 is different than 2007 as far as the residential housing market goes. Homeowners are not nearly as leveraged as they were 16 years ago. Most have mortgages at less than four percent, have far more equity in their properties, and housing prices are holding up well, primarily due to the lack of inventory. With average 30-year mortgage rates now north of 7.5% for the first time since the turn of the century, all-cash buyers are dominating what remaining deal volume is happening in the residential housing market.Now, China looks like it is on the cusp of a massive housing  that will eventually impact the global economy in ways unknown fully at the moment. However, here in the States, our problems are very likely to come from our commercial real estate or CRE market.The yield on the 10-Year Treasury () moved through the 4.8% mark in trading Tuesday for the first  since late in 2007. This is causing escalating trauma in the CRE space. For instance, real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are now down more than 20% on average from their highs earlier in 2023.Some $2.5 trillion in CRE loans need to be refinanced at sharply higher rates in the next five years. Approximately 30% of this has to be done around the office sector where values are plummeting thanks to the explosion in the virtual workforce since the Covid pandemic, which has resulted in much less demand for office real estate. Occupancy levels are running at or very near record lows in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco.CRE delinquency rates are already in the process of moving higher at an alarming rate. According to Trepp, Bank CRE mortgage delinquencies rose in the second quarter of this year, with the office sector experiencing a  in its delinquency rate, up to 4.9% from 2.7% in the first quarter and just 1.6% at the end of last year. It stood at 5.58% at the end of August.Kyle Bass, the founder of Hayman Capital Management, who correctly called out the subprime crisis before it happened, recently  Bloomberg TV:Morgan Stanley  a 40% wipeout of office property value from peak to trough. Regional banks originate approximately 70% of CRE loans and hold about 30% of overall CRE debt in the office space. Many are also already struggling with large """" on their bond portfolios due to the huge uptick in interest rates since early 2022. This is what helped trigger the bankruptcies of Silicon Valley Bank and a couple of other regional banks earlier this year. This is the key reason I built up a long-dated, out-of-the-money bear put spread position in the  in July of this year. I think investors are under-weighting the risks in this space.Office and retail are the most troubled parts of the CRE space at the moment. A recent  of market insiders (919 responses) from Bloomberg Markets revealed two-thirds believe a major crash has to happen in office property values before this sector can rebound.Most also don't see a potential rebound in this market until at least the second half of 2024.Given the continued deterioration in much of the CRE space and those potential impacts on the overall market, I continue to have my portfolio positioned quite conservatively.

"ENFR: Pipelines And Profits, A Dive Into The Energy Infrastructure-Based ETF","The energy sector is presenting an interesting picture right now. On one side of the coin, there are oil companies that are raking in the cash, thanks to the high oil prices. On the other side, there's a bit of a pickle forDemand for energy is staying strong, both here at home and on the international stage. That's music to the ears of midstream companies and MLPs-they're cashing in on this demand and riding high. Enter the  (In my , I laid down a case in favor of investing in the energy infrastructure sector and Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF specifically, a stance that has only grown stronger since then. In my view, it's a great option for investors looking to get a piece of the action in high-quality energy assets and definitely worth a spot on your radar.The Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF comprises 27  energy infrastructure companies and Master Limited Partnerships [MLPs] in the U.S. and Canada. It's a moderately sized fund, managing assets worth $124.5 million, and offers a dividend yield of 5.10% (based on the 30-day SEC yield). It is significantly smaller than some of its counterparts, like the Alerian MLP ETF (), the largest in the energy infrastructure domain, boasting over $7.1 billion in assets under management.Unlike numerous competing ETFs with a primary focus on MLPs, such as Alerian MLP ETF, ENFR incorporates both c-corporations and MLPs. In my view, this approach provides investors with a more comprehensive exposure to the energy infrastructure sector compared to the larger, MLP-centric ETFs.This distinction is vital because some of the biggest energy infrastructure players, like Kinder Morgan () and Enbridge Inc (), operate as c-corporations. These major companies are often overlooked by MLP-centric ETFs. I believe this is a significant oversight, as it denies investors access to companies that are pivotal to North America's energy infrastructure. For instance, Enbridge plays a crucial role, transporting  a third of all North American crude oil production, while Kinder Morgan's pipelines handle nearly 40% of the region's natural gas production. For those seeking comprehensive sector exposure, I consider ENFR to be the superior option over MLP-focused ETFs.Those familiar with my work know I've extensively discussed the U.S. rig count's decline and its impact on certain oilfield service providers, as highlighted in my  Ranger Energy (). Drilling activities have indeed decelerated in the U.S. throughout 2023, with a reduction of 150 rigs since the year's commencement,  to Baker Hughes (). By last week's close, 622 rigs were operational in the U.S., comprising 501 oil and 117 gas rigs-down from 618 oil rigs and 152 gas rigs at the year's onset.While this situation poses challenges for oilfield services companies facing diminished demand, it actually hasn't translated into a drop in oil and gas production. In fact, U.S. production levels have risen. Despite a slowdown from the shale boom era, this year has seen an increase in production volumes, showcasing enhanced efficiency from oil and gas producers, enabling them to extract more with fewer resources. U.S. oil production climbed to 12.99 million bpd by July, an increase from 12.57 million bpd at the start of the year, as per U.S. Energy Information Administration . Concurrently, gas production also  to 3.22 trillion cf in July, up from January's 3.16 trillion cf.Should oil prices maintain their strength, we could witness a revival in rig counts as U.S. producers potentially increase drilling activities to meet rising energy demands and compensate for OPEC+ supply gaps. This scenario might boost U.S. oil and gas production growth.Oil prices have seen nearly a 10% surge over the past three months, with WTI hitting $86 a barrel at the time of this writing. This uptrend is partly attributable to OPEC+'s  restrictions. Just last month, Saudi Arabia-the group's powerhouse-committed to extending its one-million-barrel-per-day output reduction until the end of 2023, a stance echoed by Russia in its decision to keep its crude oil exports down by 300,000 bpd during the same period. The International Energy Agency has  the potential for these actions to push the oil market into a deficit in Q4-2023.Compounding this are the escalated geopolitical tensions following the Israel-Hamas conflict. While Israel is not a significant player in the global oil market, the conflict's potential to spread, particularly to the Persian Gulf region, cannot be overlooked, as it may disrupt oil supplies. A potential tightening of U.S. sanctions on Iran  withdraw 500,000 bpd of Iranian oil from the market, further constricting supply and potentially elevating prices.Nonetheless, the current production lull from OPEC and its allies presents a unique opportunity for U.S. oil and gas producers to step in, bridge the gap, and expand their market share. This scenario would ensure a steady flow of oil and gas through pipelines, guaranteeing sustained demand for energy infrastructure assets, which is a positive development for the midstream sector.The energy infrastructure companies and MLPs within the ENFR portfolio are poised to reap benefits from the current business climate, displaying promising potential for earnings growth. Note that ENFR is top-heavy ETF, predominantly influenced by the largest players in the energy infrastructure arena. The ETF's top-10  encapsulate the industry's giants, including Enterprise Products Partners () and Enbridge. Collectively, its leading 10 holdings represent a substantial 65% of the ETF's total assets.Amongst these, the top two holdings-Enterprise Products and Enbridge-exemplify ENFR's strength in diversification, blending both MLPs and C-corporations in its asset pool. Enterprise Products, an MLP, and Enbridge, a C-corporation, highlight the ETF's capacity to fairly represent the energy infrastructure industry.Exploring ENFR's top holding, Enterprise Products stands out as one of the world's biggest midstream companies. It boasts an impressive assortment of midstream assets, notably within the Natural Gas Liquids [NGL] value chain. Enterprise Products' reach  over 50,000 miles of pipelines, augmented by an array of natural gas processing plants, fractionators, and PDH and iBDH facilities. This extensive asset base is matched by strong demand, as evident in its  results in which its pipelines achieved record oil equivalent volumes of 11.9 million barrels.Furthermore, Enterprise Products exhibits stellar performance in generating Distributable Cash Flows [DCF], consistently surpassing cash distributions and resulting in a robust coverage ratio. A case in point: the second quarter saw the firm generating $1.7 billion in DCF,  to a solid 1.6x coverage ratio. With a proven track record of converting high-quality assets into steady cash flows year after year, Enterprise Products has maintained an upward trajectory in dividend growth for over 25 consecutive years, affirming its commitment to unitholder value.Currently, Enterprise Products is channeling its efforts into numerous  initiatives aimed at capturing the expanding U.S. oil and gas production volumes. The completion of four major projects, including a cryogenic natural gas processing plant, an NGL fractionator, and a propane dehydrogenation [PDH] plant marks significant progress. Alongside these completed projects, an additional capital commitment of $4.1 billion has been earmarked for upcoming projects that will come online in the coming quarters and are poised to boost earnings and cash flow, which ensures sustained distribution growth. This ongoing development bodes well for ENFR's performance.Switching focus to Enbridge, ENFR's second-largest holding, we observe a formidable asset base comprising liquid pipelines, and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities. Additionally, Enbridge's portfolio extends into renewable energy, featuring wind farms in Europe and solar energy projects across North America. Much like Enterprise Products, Enbridge stands out for its consistent cash flow generation and a stellar record of dividend growth spanning over 28 years.Enbridge is working on a  suite of 17 growth projects, representing a cumulative investment of CAD $19 billion (approximately $13.8 billion USD). Notable projects include the 137-mile Rio Bravo , poised to supply natural gas to the Rio Grande LNG export facility in Texas, and the Woodfibre LNG export  in British Columbia, boasting a production capacity of 2.1 million tons per annum. Additionally, a significant expansion  British Columbia natural gas pipeline system is also underway. These initiatives, set to materialize over the next five years, are expected to fuel Enbridge's growth trajectory, subsequently enriching ENFR's potential for returns.ENFR's biggest holdings have consistently demonstrated their capacity to reward shareholders through dividends while generating strong cash flows. They appear to be strategically positioned to reap the rewards of the strong business environment, investing significantly to maximize the advantages of the favorable market conditions. As they bring their new projects to fruition, we can expect their earnings and cash flows to continue growing. This, in turn, should enable them to sustain and potentially increase their dividends and distributions, positively influencing ENFR's overall performance.When we delve into the valuation aspect of ENFR's holdings, the findings are intriguing. Approximately 37% of the holdings, constituting a combined weight of 36%, have garnered attractive valuation grades ranging from A+ to B- on Seeking Alpha's Factor Grades. Meanwhile, an equivalent number of holdings, representing a slightly higher weight of 38%, have been assigned valuation grades varying from C+ to C-. Focusing on the ETF's top two holdings, Enterprise Products and Enbridge  been  valuation grades of C+ and B- respectively. However, it is noteworthy that within the top-10 holdings, four companies-Cheniere Energy (), Kinder Morgan, Williams Companies (), and Targa Resources ()-collectively accounting for 21% of the total weight, present less attractive investment opportunities with valuation grades ranging from D to F.Given this assortment of valuation grades, creating a diverse landscape with no clear inclination towards higher attractiveness in terms of valuation, my assessment leads me to categorize ENFR as a 'hold'.It is also important to address the potential risks when evaluating investment opportunities. Although ENFR presents a promising outlook, navigating the current high interest rate environment remains a formidable challenge for energy infrastructure companies and MLPs. Rising interest rates directly impact borrowing costs, potentially hindering the development of new projects and limiting future growth prospects. For energy infrastructure companies burdened by substantial debt, the current financial landscape is particularly challenging. Refinancing in such conditions escalates costs, potentially straining their financial resources. This, in turn, could lead to reduced profits, leaving less capital available for shareholder payouts.Additionally, the high borrowing costs do not operate in isolation. The high interest rate environment also contributes to a broader economic slowdown, with potential repercussions for energy demand. A contraction in energy consumption could place further pressure on the energy infrastructure sector. This scenario is not without precedent; the industry faced significant headwinds during the pandemic as energy demand plummeted. While it's critical to acknowledge that the severity of the pandemic's impact represents an extreme case, it serves as a stark reminder of the industry's vulnerability to demand fluctuations.

California Resources: A Counterintuitive Play In A State Planning To Eliminate Fossil Fuels,"Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Eugene Linden as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. California Resources (), an oil and gas company, is one of the largest oil producers in California. On the face of it, this might seem to be a huge negative since CRC’s market likely has the most  climate policies of any large economy (if California were a country it’s GDP would  5 among nations) in the world. And, indeed, investors have shied from the company in part because of its regulatory and permitting headwinds. However, the very factors that limit new drilling relieve the company of the need forCRC is one of the largest oil companies operating in California. Its original assets formed the core of Occidental Petroleum, which was founded in 1920. As noted, the state is an “oil island,” unconnected by oil pipelines to the rest of the nation, which means that most of the oil California uses comes in by tanker, and thus California’s oil is priced to Brent rather than West Texas Intermediate.Because it produces oil in a state that imports about 2/3 of its oil, and because CRC owns about 1.3 million acres of the  on which it drills (as listed in the most recent 10-K), the company has certain advantages. With greatly reduced transportation costs, the company’s realized revenue from oil is very close to index price. Because it owns most of the acreage where it produces oil, CRC does not have to pay the 12.5% royalty that is typically charged for oil production on leased land. Among its holdings are some of the most productive oil fields in the U.S. (Elk Hills in Kern County), and about 14,000 valuable acres in the Los Angeles Basin.CRC was spun off Occidental Petroleum in 2014. In 2020 it filed for bankruptcy, groaning under a $5 billion debt load. It emerged from bankruptcy in Nov. 2020, just three months after filing. As of June 30, 2023, the company had one $600 million senior note outstanding, and only $152 million of net debt after cash. Freed from crushing debt service, it has been something of a cash machine, generating $1.1 billion of free cash flow since Q4, 2020, and  $697 million of that cash to shareholders through a fixed dividend and share buybacks. The buybacks have reduced the share count from 83 million to 69 million as of June 30 (same slide deck as above, page 10).As of June 30, the trailing twelve month revenue was about $3.4 billion and TTM EBITDA was about . At about $55 a share, the EV to EBITDA multiple was about 2.75, below the oil industry average of between 3 and 5 times. On the other hand, CRC trades above 4 times the multiple based on expected EBITDA in 2024.CRC produces about  barrels of net oil equivalent a day, with 61% of that oil, 20% gas, and 13% natural gas liquids (the gas percentage has temporarily grown to 27% because CRC has been having difficulty getting permitting for maintenance drilling in oil-rich Kern County after an appeals court  new permitting for drilling).As might be expected, CRC’s performance is highly sensitive to oil and gas prices. Just how sensitive was revealed in the company’s Q1 ’23 performance. It had guided to free cash flow of $151 million to $180 million. As it turned out, all of the variables CRC listed, such as total production, operating costs, G&A, etc., were . Free cash flow, however, blew past expectations, coming in at $263 million. This was in part because of  in a key pipeline carrying natural gas to California, forcing the state to rely more on local production.CRC prices its natural gas to Henry Hub. Most natural gas companies have a negative differential to Henry Hub prices because of transportation costs. EQT, for instance, one of the largest natural gas producers in the U.S., estimates about $0.50 negative  per million BTU to Henry Hub. Because it is producing gas in its home state, CRC usually has very little negative differential and sometimes the differential turns to positive.Because of drilling restrictions, particularly in Kern County, California’s richest oil fields (accounting for  of the state’s onshore oil production), CRC is not even meeting its spending projections for maintenance. The company has been operating for over 100 years in California, and it knows its fields, which means that what drilling the company does yields highly predictable results. This in turn means that CRC’s fields have a very shallow decline curve, on the order of 10% (7%-13% for  fields) annually. By contrast shale oil fields often see declines of 25-30% a year (and  recently  the typical decline at 40%).Carbon capture has become a centerpiece of CRC’s move to diversify away from fossil fuels and help California meet its climate goals. To that end, it has formed a joint venture with Brookfield, called the , to develop the infrastructure for sequestering CO2 underground. The joint venture allows the company to offload some of the capital costs (according to a company presentation, CRC’s share of the first five years of capital costs will be $. In that same presentation, CRC  EBITDA generated by the joint venture will be between $225 million and $675 million by year end 2028.For investors, the biggest question marks lie in the gauntlet of regulatory hurdles and restrictions on drill permitting that oil companies must deal with in California. Together with operating costs, this makes CRC a relatively high-cost producer at about $47-$48 a barrel. Using various estimates of ’24 EBITDA given futures strip prices at various levels, we can arrive at a rough sensitivity of a $20 million change in EBITDA for every $1 change in futures strip price. And therein lies the rub because Brent prices have varied wildly over the past few years. If the price of oil remains at $90, EBITDA might even rise a bit in ’24 because the company has plans to lower production costs. If, as the street expects, the price averages in the low 80s next year, EBITDA will drop, probably by about $100 million, but the company will still be generating sold free cash flow. If stock buybacks continue, that should provide natural upward pressure on stock prices even with stable EBITDA.Because the biggest variables that will impact CRC's performance are external and out of the company's control -- e.g. the price of Brent, a new or renewed pandemic, actions by OPEC, Russian sanctions, and all types of geopolitical turmoil, including the new war between Israel and Hamas -- any projections of future earnings should be taken with a very large grain of salt. What can be said is that because CRC is spending virtually nothing on exploration or expansion, its production should be maintained (or decline slowly), its expenses should be quite stable, and that being the case, barring external events, revenues will remain stable (using strip pricing), but CRC should steadily build cash and move from tiny net debt to rather large negative net debt. In fact, by the end of 2026, in such circumstances, cash might build from $448 million at the end of Q2, to close to $1.8 billion, enough to pay off its $600 million in debt at maturity with plenty of cushion.That's the virtue of CRC; in an unpredictable world, its future is relatively predictable. Brent pricing - currently at $88 - is well above CRC's guidance of about $75 for the second half of 2023. If Brent retreats to an average of $80, the market could still justify a share price of around $61 using 69 million shares, a terminal multiple of 5, and Henry Hub of $3.50. On the other hand, the uncertainties of when/if Kern County will allow resumed drilling, and California's hostility to oil might cause investors to use a lower multiple, in which case, a fair valuation at $80 Brent might be in the $49 a share range. Regardless of how far Brent rises, investors are unlikely to reward CRC with a soaring price simply because it's operating in increasingly hostile waters.CRC's dividend, which costs the company about $78 million a year is safe so long as Brent doesn't not spend a very protracted period in the low to mid $40s.There are a couple of positive outliers that could boost CRC’s multiples and value. They have to do with the land that the company owns and its drilling expertise. With regard to CRC’s land owned in fee, while the company does not have to pay a royalty on this land, CRC could collect that royalty itself and use it to fund a securitization. Royalty securitizations typically trade at 12-15 multiples or nearly twice the multiple of an E&P company, and could provide a lift to the stock.CRC not only has lots of land, but it also has drilling expertise and equipment. One possibility for zero-carbon, cheap electrical generation comes from a promising new form of renewable energy called deep geothermal. Deep geothermal involves drilling through the basalt or granite that lies roughly 8 km. or more below the surface. Rock this hard defeats conventional drills, but a number of startups are using millimeter wave technology developed in plasma labs to vaporize the rock and permit access to virtually unlimited reservoirs of 1,000 degree F heat that could produce steam and  most gas or coal-fired electrical generation plants. Estimated costs for such electricity, including capital costs, run between 1 cent and 3 cents per kilowatt hour – as cheap as any electricity on the planet. CRC hasn’t explored this possibility, but if deep geothermal gains traction (pilot projects are already in process), it might do well to consider a joint venture.CRC is not alone in managing its assets for cash flow rather than growth. That’s true of most E&P companies. As one analyst told me, “’Drill baby drill’ has left the building.” One differentiating factor for CRC is that given California’s regulatory and permitting hurdles, and also the state’s plan to drive fossil fuel use close to zero, it pursue growth exploration even if it wanted to.Management realizes this, and is also trying to make a virtue of necessity. Rather than fight California’s attempts to reduce carbon emissions, it’s trying to make them a profit center through its ambitious carbon sequestration program, and also through renewable-driven electrical generating programs. If it’s estimates of future EBITDA for Carbon Terravault come to pass by 2028 year-end, that program alone could contribute up to $8 a share in value. Looking at this another way, if the carbon sequestration joint venture produces $675 million in EBITDA by YE 2028, it could cushion a $16 drop in oil prices (as CRC will take half the benefit).The company makes a strong argument that as California reduces its reliance on fossil fuels it should do so by decreasing imports, not domestic production. In part it’s an economic argument: the company argues that it’s spent $16.8 billion in the state since 2014 and  $2.9 billion in revenues and taxes (as well as thousands of jobs), and that to the degree the state continues to consume oil it’s better if that oil comes from California rather than Alaska, Ecuador or Saudi Arabia. From an environmental and climate standpoint, it’s better for oil to come from a company that is abiding by strict environmental laws, than to come from sources where governments often turn a blind eye to pollution, methane releases, and other climate-related issues. CRC also argues that it has some of the lowest carbon intensity of any producing company in the U.S., meaning that it uses relatively little energy to get the oil out of the ground.As someone who has long argued that human-caused climate change poses a dire threat to society, the economy, and the biosphere; and also as someone who believes that we are not nearly doing enough to transition away from fossil fuels, I also realize that we still need to produce oil and gas during that transition. The jury is still out on whether CRC will be able to meet its goals for diversification away from fossil fuels, but it is to be applauded for its efforts to meet the needs of the various stakeholders, while abiding by the stringent rules of a large economy that has the most aggressive decarbonization program in the world. As such, it could someday provide a model for other fossil fuel companies facing the transition to climate-friendly energy.A near-term risk is that the appeals court does not lift the stay on drilling permitting in Kern county. And when/if the appeals court lifts the stay, CRC is going to have to spend additional money to make up for lost production. Most observers expect the issue to be resolved, but it’s unclear how long this will take. Another risk is that we’re talking about California after all, so the company also could encounter other road blocks as time goes by and the impacts of climate change intensify. And yet another risk is a black swan disruption to the oil market, as occurred in April, 2020. A free fall drop in oil prices could inflict pain, but the company has no near-term debt maturity, tiny net debt, and - at $900 million plus - plenty of liquidity.The bottom line is that in its unlevered state, CRC is being managed for cash flow, and it is returning about 60% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. The two most important variables are whether California imposes even tougher restrictions, and the price of Brent. As for Brent, if it falls back into the mid-50s, CRC’s EBITDA could take a roughly $600 million hit. If Brent remains in the recent range of $80s to $90s, CRC will do just fine. As for California, if the state manages its decarbonization through a decline in imports, CRC will have a long and profitable runway. At $55 a share, the dividend is about 2%, though shareholders also benefit as buybacks reduce share count. Management seems well-suited to navigating California’s oil-hostile landscape in a responsible way.I spent 15 years as a strategist at a hedge fund focused on distressed situations. One of the postulates of distress investing is that even in industries headed for oblivion there will be opportunities because technical and emotional factors often cause the markets to price companies as though oblivion will come faster than the facts warrant. Moreover, businesses adapt – e.g., today only about 8% of Apple’s () revenues come from the Mac. CRC is in a sector headed for oblivion, but it is broadening its portfolio through various forms of carbon capture, renewables, and greener inputs for agriculture. It also has the best balance sheet in the business, and while the stock may not soar, it will likely produce returns for shareholders for years to come as it gradually shifts to renewables and CO2 storage comes on line.

Suncor Energy: 5 Reasons It's Going Higher,"Suncor () is one of the largest oil companies in Canada. Somewhat like Exxon Mobil (), it produces oil, processes that oil into refinery products such as gasoline and diesel, and sells those end products inUnlike Exxon, it does not drill for oil, it extracts oil from oil sands, which is more of a mining process than a drilling process.Suncor is in what I will call the ""run out"" phase of its business. It is past needing much exploration and development, rather, it is extracting its known reserves as we work through the energy transition. Over the next few decades, Suncor will produce oil and eventually have to transition to another business or cease operations in the middle of the century.As a result of lower capex and oilI rate Suncor a buy for Canadians. It is worth watching for Americans and is a potential trade, however, be aware of the 15% dividend tax haircut if you intend to hold it long-term.Here are five reasons why I think Suncor is a buy now.As you can see from the following chart, Suncor has 26 years of reserves.In addition, it can produce those reserves profitably at an average price of $35 per barrel and still pay the dividend. While we have seen $35 oil prices during Covid, with the depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and EV adoption still several years away from causing outright demand destruction, oil markets are likely to remain on Kirk's ""peak oil plateau"" versus plunge.Another difference between Suncor and the other oil majors is that it has very little overseas exposure. In other words, well over 90% of its oil comes from its own sources in the oil sands therefore, they are not exposed to what I would call foreign entanglements.The ability to extract more oil from the sands does not come with significant capex, thus, margins are relatively high after the sunk in costs, which, are already sunk.Suncor spends very little money on exploration and exploratory drilling. Due to Canadian policy, Suncor is essentially in a ""run off"" phase of its business. That is, they are simply going to extract their 26 year known reserves over time.This gives Suncor much higher gross margins than other oil companies such as Exxon. This can be seen in the following chart comparing Suncor to Exxon and Chevron ().Because Suncor has a very low cost per barrel, it tends to have very high refinery margins, also called the crack spread. This means that when the raw material, i.e., a barrel of oil, is cracked, it is turned into gasoline, diesel, or other end-user products. The differential between the barrel of oil cost and what the end products are sold for is called the crack spread.The Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is nearing completion. This expansion will more than double the amount of oil being transported to the West Coast and from there to Asia including China and India. This will be a huge advantage for Suncor as it will enlarge its market which currently is mainly the US market and a minor amount to Europe from the East Coast.Now admittedly, the Trans Mountain has been under construction for 10 years and has run into all kinds of issues, but there appears to be only one left before completion. That revolves around Native Americans and environmentalists asking for a route deviation. It appears, at the moment, that this issue will be resolved positively and that Sun Corps will be shipping to Asia sometime in 2024 or 2025 at the latest.Over the last few quarters, Suncor has bought back 22% of its shares. Most investors have heard about Exxon’s huge $75 billion share buyback and Chevron’s huge $50 billion share buyback, but neither one has bought back nearly the number of shares on a percentage basis as Suncor has.Since Suncor has dedicated $2.3 billion per year for its dividend, the dividend keeps growing with every share bought back since the $2.3 billion would be divided by a smaller number. Management has said this will go on indefinitely based on free cash flow which is currently substantial.Suncor is also paying down its $12 billion debt and it’s promised when it hits its required debt of $9 billion, it will buy back even more shares. In other words, at some point in the near future, Suncor will be buying back shares with 100% of its free cash flow, which is a substantial amount.The dividend plus share buybacks combine for a current ""shareholder yield"" of 9.9% in the most recent rolling quarter. A more complete definition of ""shareholder yield"" includes debt reduction. On that score, Suncor is making a huge progress in creating value for shareholders.Suncor is in the middle of its trading range, but appears to be ready to challenge resistance again. With the share count falling rapidly, breaking through resistance seems likely if oil prices stay firm.A reasonable price target is about $50 per share in the next year as the share count decreases and Suncor investors realize shareholder yield, driving interest in buying.As with any oil-related investment, the major risk is oil price volatility. Predicting future oil prices sometimes seems like studying chicken entrails for the correct answer. But considering the current world issues in the Middle East and elsewhere, the odds would favor a higher price. However, there are no guarantees, as we all know.Another issue with Suncor is what I would call a perception issue, which I personally think is exaggerated. Nonetheless, from an investment standpoint, you have to pay attention to it. This includes  and a .The third problem you can’t do anything about is since most of Suncor’s business is with the United States, there is the issue of the exchange rate, and in troubled times, the dollar tends to go up because it is considered a safe haven currency and all other currencies including the Canadian dollar tend to go down relative to the US dollar.One possible positive relative to currency is the expansion of the export business to Asia, especially China, but also India, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc could reduce Suncor's overall exchange rate risk.Looking at Suncor relative to other potential oil company investments begins with whether you believe the oil price will be going up in the near future, staying the same, or potentially dropping back to the mid-60s price that it had in July. But that point is true for all oil company investments, not just Suncor. However, you could lessen your risk by going with an ETF such as Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ().In my opinion, Suncor stock is a strong buy, and I am expecting a price of $50 by next year.Kirk Spano, founder of , contributed to this article.

Wall Street Breakfast: Strike Heats Up,,62,2023-10-12T07:01:21.000-04:00
Plains All American Yields Over 7% And Looks Undervalued,"Whenever I write about Energy Transfer () or Enterprise Products Partners (), the one company that consistently turns up in my valuation models as an undervalued opportunity is Plains All American (). IPAA is an interesting energy infrastructure company as its focus is predominantly throughout the centralized region of North America. While PAA provides critical infrastructure to our economy, it provides significant takeaway capacity and access to the U.S. and global energy markets for Canadian crude and NGLs. PAA operates 18,300 miles of  pipelines and has 74 million barrels of commercial crude storage capacity. PAA has 4 marine facilities and operates 7 crude rail terminals. On the  side of its business, PAA operates 1,620 miles of NGL pipelines, 9 fractionation plants, 4 processing facilities, and 16 NGL rail terminals. PAA is a full-service energy infrastructure company providing takeaway capacity through pipes, trucks, and rail, and storage for upstream exploitation and production companies to connect with refiners and exporters to international markets in the crude markets.Above is a picture of PAA's energy infrastructure across its asset base. Below is a map of all the petroleum pipelines and export/import facilities in the lower 48 portion of the U.S. according to the Energy Information Agency (EIA) . PAA's assets are at the heart of the American crude industry as they connect several basins to the most densely populated export/import location for American crude. Oil and gas aren't going away, and I feel investing in hard asset's is a theme that will become more popular as the years progress. PAA's infrastructure is next to impossible to be replicated by another company as the barriers to entry are immense for new companies to enter the space.PAA could have significant growth running through their pipes as the 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA () indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids, and natural gas will increase through 2050. The EIA also projects that the U.S. will remain a net exporter of oil and gas through 2050. My logic is simple as I follow what the government agencies responsible for energy are publishing. If the U.S. will grow its oil and gas production for the next 3 decades, then it will need excess transpiration capacity for these fuels. If the U.S. remains a net exporter, growing its oil and gas exports, then more fuel will have the Gulf Coast as a final destination. These are not my projections; they are the U.S. government projections, and I want to invest in companies that have infrastructure in these areas that can capitalize on the future growth in these areas. PAA is positioned to benefit from a growing domestic and international energy demand, and I feel unitholders can be rewarded with an appreciating unit price and growing distribution.PAA finished its  generating $33.67 billion in revenue, $2.5 billion in cash from operations, $1.32 billion in FCF, $10.22 billion in total debt, and having 728 million units outstanding. Based on the trailing twelve-month (TTM) numbers, PAA has grown its revenue by 52.16% ($17.56 billion) to $51.23 billion, its FCF by 76.64% ($1.01 billion) to $2.34 billion, reduced its total debt by -19.79% (-$1.92 billion) to $8.3 billion, and repurchased 29.6 million units, decreasing its shares outstanding by -4.07%. Today, you're able to purchase units below where they were prior to the improved balance sheet, financial growth, and lowered unit count.PAA has also strategically strengthened its company to capitalize on the future of American energy.  closed on its 43% acquisition of Diamondback Energy's () interest in OMOG JV LLC for approximately $225 million. This was funded through excess FCF, and further aligns PAA with FANG in the Midland Basin. PAA has updated its 2023 guidance and expects to come in the high end of its range for Adjusted EBITDA of $2.45 - $2.55 billion while decreasing its leverage to under 3.5x. PAA is expecting its FCF to come in around the $1.6 billion level in 2023, which will allow it to further reduce its debt load and should help provide future distribution increases.Like some other energy infrastructure companies, PAA reduced its distribution in 2020. Since then, PAA has improved its financial position, reduced debt, and provided 2 distribution increases. The quarterly distribution has grown from $0.18 to $0.27 in less than 2 years, and considering PAA is expected to retain $600 million of its $1.6 billion of FCF in 2023 after distributions, there is no reason for me to believe that increasing the distribution further isn't part of the gameplan. The current valuation looks discounted, provided the progress PAA has delivered.For Midstream Operators, I look at the enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA, total debt to Adjusted EBITDA, the market cap to Adjusted EBITDA, market cap to distributable cash flow, and distribution yields. This helps me determine if there is an opportunity in one midstream units over another. PAA has always looked strong, and I am specifically looking at PAA based on these metrics.I will compare PAA to the following companies:PAA trades at the lowest valuation on an enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA methodology, slightly under ET. The peer group average for this metric is 9.31x, and PAA is trading well below this at 7.86x.From a market cap to Adjusted EBITDA perspective, PAA also looks undervalued, trading at 3.53x compared to a 5.52x peer group average. PAA trades at a slightly higher multiple than ET but significantly below the rest of its peers.I want to pay the best multiple I can for DCF, and PAA is trading at 5.8x its DCF compared to the peer group average of 7.19x. ET is the only other company from the peer group that trades under a 6x multiple on its DCF.From a debt perspective, PAA trades at the lowest ratio as its total debt to Adjusted EBITDA is 2.77x. The peer group has an average of 3.3x, and PAA is the only peer that trades under 3x. From a leverage position, PAA looks attractive.PAA has a distribution yield that exceeds 7%, but it's under the 7.78% peer group average. While I love a large yield, I am willing to invest in a smaller yield where the company has strong underlying fundamentals and ratios.PAA looks very interesting, and while I am not a unitholder, I am certainly considering adding PAA to my income-producing portfolio in the future. I think PAA is undervalued as its assets provide critical infrastructure to the oil and gas industry and are positioned to benefit from a growing demand for traditional energy. As the U.S. continues to increase production and exporting loads, I think PAA will see increased amounts of fuel running through its system and ultimately drive revenue and FCF higher. Based on the valuation, PAA could be an interesting acquisition target in an industry that has seen continuous consolidation through M&A activity. At a $23.5 billion enterprise value and $10.56 billion market cap, PAA looks interesting for an investment and as a target for an acquisition.

"Cross Timbers Royalty Trust Is Risky, Even After A 39% Decline","About three years ago, I  that Cross Timbers Royalty Trust () could double over the following two years, as its stock price had been beaten to the extreme amid the coronavirus crisis. The stock doubled in justCross Timbers Royalty Trust is an oil and gas trust that holds a 90% net profit interest in some producing properties in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico and a 75% net profit interest in a few other properties in Texas and Oklahoma. The trust  approximately 50% of its revenues from oil and the other 50% from natural gas. Therefore, it is important to examine the outlook of both the oil market and the natural gas market in order to evaluate the stock.Cross Timbers Royalty Trust has been thriving since early last year thanks to the Ukrainian crisis. Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine, the U.S. and the European Union initiated strict sanctions on the oil and gas exports of Russia. As the latter had a market share of about 10% in the global oil market and 35% in the European gas market, both markets became extremely tight and thus the prices of oil and gas skyrocketed to multi-year highs last year.These developments were ideal for a pure upstream oil and gas producer, such as Cross Timbers Royalty Trust. To be sure, the trust grew its distribution per unit  last year, from $1.10 in 2021 to an 8-year high of $1.96 last year.The prices of oil and gas have moderated off their blowout levels last year, as the global energy market has begun to absorb the impact of the war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, as there is a lag between benchmark prices and the actual realized prices of the trust, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust has offered total distributions of  in the first 9 months of this year. When annualized, this performance is roughly in line with the performance of the trust last year. At the current stock price, these distributions correspond to a 10.9% annualized yield.However, in the second quarter, the price of oil decreased 18% over the prior year's quarter while oil production remained flat. The average realized gas prices rose significantly, but their effect was offset by reduced gas output due to timing of sales. As a result, the distribution of the trust in the second quarter decreased 16% year-on-year.Moreover, the realized oil and gas prices of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust decreased further in the third quarter, as they finally caught up with the decrease in benchmark prices. Although Cross Timbers Royalty Trust will report its third quarter results in November, we already know that its distributions in the third quarter fell 34% over the prior year's period.As Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is highly sensitive to the prices of both oil and gas, we will examine the outlook of each market separately in order to evaluate the stock.As mentioned above, the price of oil reached a multi-year high last year due to the sanctions of western countries on Russia. However, Russia has finally found ways to offset the impact of the sanctions by directing higher volumes of crude oil to China, India and a few other Asian countries.On the other hand, OPEC and Russia have implemented several rounds of production cuts in order to limit the global oil supply and thus support the price of oil. The latest decision of Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their production cuts of 1.3 million barrels per day until the end of the year triggered a 22% rally of the oil price in just one month. Overall, the price of oil has remained above average, even though it has deflated off blowout levels last year.However, it is important to realize that the strategy of OPEC and Russia results in a transfer of market share from these countries to non-OPEC countries. As per the latest  of the International Energy Administration [IEA], the aggregate production cuts of 2.5 million barrels per day of OPEC and Russia since early this year have been offset by record U.S. and Brazilian output and a steep production increase from Iran. Therefore, OPEC and Russia are not likely to continue reducing their production much further to support the oil price.Moreover, demand growth is expected to decelerate from next year due to the exponential increase in the sales of electric vehicles and a record number of green energy projects that are in their development phase. The boom in green energy projects, which has resulted from the sky-high oil prices experienced last year, is not likely to abate until oil prices plunge from current levels. Given also the proven cyclicality of oil prices, it is prudent to expect lower oil prices in the upcoming years.The price of natural gas collapsed early this year due to an abnormally warm winter but it has recovered strongly since then thanks to strong demand, though it remains about 65% lower than its multi-year peak last year.As per the latest  of the Energy Information Administration [EIA], U.S. natural gas consumption is expected to have grown by 5% in September over the prior year, to a new all-time high, after record levels in July and August. This helps explain the approximate 50% rally of the price of natural gas off its lows this year.However, U.S. natural gas consumption is expected to decrease from 89.7 to 88.8 billion cubic feet per day next year while production is expected to grow by 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. While higher LNG exports are likely to cover part of the resultant surplus, the gas market is likely to be well supplied next year, in the absence of severe winter weather. Given also the aforementioned boom in green energy projects, which resulted from the fierce energy crisis experienced last year, it is prudent not to expect higher gas prices in the upcoming years. As soon as all the renewable energy projects being developed begin to generate energy, they will probably reduce the consumption of natural gas.Most stocks are evaluated based on their price-to-earnings ratios. However, oil and gas trusts distribute all their net income to their unitholders. Therefore, they can be evaluated based on their distribution yield. More precisely, investors can compare the current distribution yield to the historical average distribution yield of a trust to draw a conclusion on the valuation of the trust.As mentioned above, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust has offered total distributions of $1.52 in the first 9 months of the year, corresponding to a 10.9% yield at the current stock price. However, as oil prices have decreased and gas prices have plunged off last year’s blowout levels, this yield is misleading.The trust has offered total distributions of $0.49 in the last four months. These distributions, which correspond to an annualized yield of 7.9%, are more representative of normal commodity prices. The 7.9% yield may seem high on the surface, but it is lower than the 10-year average yield of 9.3% of the stock.The market has historically required such a high yield from Cross Timbers Royalty Trust over the last decade primarily due to the risk related to the long-term natural decline of the production of the trust. The trust  that it expects its oil and gas production to decrease by 6%-8% per year on average over the long run. This is an extremely strong headwind for future returns. To be sure, despite the 13-year high prices of oil and gas last year, the distributions in 2022 were 26% lower than those in 2014.To conclude regarding the valuation of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust, we note that its current yield (7.9%) is lower than its 10-year average yield (9.3%). Therefore, the stock appears overvalued right now.Notably Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is currently offering a higher yield than its peers Sabine Royalty Trust () and Permian Basin Royalty Trust (), which are yielding  and , respectively, based on their distributions in the last four months. However, these trusts are probably overvalued as well thanks to the above average prices of oil and gas prevailing right now.As mentioned earlier, it is prudent to expect oil prices to deflate off current levels and gas prices to moderate, primarily due to the accelerated shift of the entire world from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Whenever oil and gas prices incur a material correction, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust will probably have significant downside risk.In order for Cross Timbers Royalty Trust to reach a reasonable valuation level, the stock should correct by about 18% (=9.3%/7.9% -1) and then by at least ~20% in order to account for the expected moderation of commodity prices and the production decay of the trust. Therefore, a more reasonable stock price would be approximately $12.2 (=$18.64 * 0.82 * 0.80).The long-term outlook for oil and gas prices is bearish due to the boom of green energy projects but a temporary rally of these prices cannot be excluded. If OPEC and Russia keep reducing their output, they will trigger a rally of the price of oil or avert its correction. A geopolitical event, such as the recent turmoil in Israel, could also fuel a rally of the oil price. In addition, natural gas prices will probably rally if we experience an exceptionally cold winter. In all these cases, the stock of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is likely to enjoy a rally off its current price.Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is offering a seemingly attractive yield of 7.9%. However, oil and gas prices are likely to decrease at some point in the upcoming years due to the ongoing transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. As a result, distributions are likely to decrease in the future. Given also the material decrease in the production of the trust over the long run, the stock has significant downside risk.

UPS: Moving To A Buy On This 4% Yield Stock As Fundamentals Bottom,"I have  following a wait-and-watch approach on United Parcel Service, Inc.'s () stock and remaining on the sidelines in my last few articles as the company faced headwinds from lower demand and theWhile the margins are expected to remain under pressure over the next year due to high wages and benefits increase in Year 1 of the new contract, the sell-side estimates on stock price have already come down and are reflecting these headwinds. Further, the company is working on cost-cutting related to non-driver jobs which along with volume recovery shouldIn my previous article, I discussed the headwinds UPS was facing due to tough macroeconomic conditions which were expected to adversely impact the company's results. The company has reported its Q2 results since then and a similar trend was seen.In the second quarter of 2023, the company saw reductions in both residential and commercial shipments due to challenging external conditions, including persistent inflation, declines in U.S. manufacturing production, and a reduction in discretionary consumer spending, which contributed to overall volume declines. This resulted in a 10.9% Y/Y decrease in revenue to $22.1 billion with a 9.3% decline in average shipment volume.Looking forward, I believe the worst is behind us in terms of volume declines and Y/Y volume decline should moderate in the coming quarters. In addition to the tough macroeconomic environment, the Teamsters contract negotiations also had an adverse impact on the company's volumes until the agreement was finalized in July as the customers looked to move their freight to alternative carriers to prevent a potential disruption in case of a strike. If we look at the monthly cadence, UPS saw a Y/Y volume decline of ~7% in March and April which worsened to ~12% in June and, according to management, July was also down low double-digit though slightly better than June.Post the new contract negotiation ending with Teamsters, the company is focusing on winning back those customers as well as acquiring new customers by highlighting its superior service and capabilities. The company won't win back all the lost volume immediately, but I expect sequential improvement as the company's third quarter progresses and into the fourth quarter. So, the pace of decline should reduce moving forward, and we should see a return to growth sometime next year (most likely Q2 2024 due to easier comparisons).The company is also focused on growth initiatives like the Digital Access Program, growth in the healthcare business, and international expansion to drive growth.The company continues to gain good traction with its Digital Access Program (DAP) and introduced plug-and-play technology last quarter to make it even easier for e-commerce platforms to connect. In the second quarter, the company added 7 new e-commerce platforms including 4 international platforms to DAP. The company is well-positioned to achieve its ~$3 bn revenue target from DAP this year.Another important long-term growth driver for the company is its focus on growing its healthcare logistics business. The company is focusing on both organic and inorganic growth routes to become the leading provider of complex healthcare logistics solutions and is continuing to expand its globally connected, tech-enabled cold chain network to provide the best service to its clients. The company recently acquired MNX Global Logistics, a global provider of time-critical logistics services that should bring more precision and capabilities to UPS' existing solutions. Global healthcare logistics is a ~$130 bn market and emerging competitors like Amazon's () third-party logistics have limited advantages in this market. So, this should be a defensive, high-growth, and profitable niche for UPS in the long run.The company is also doing a good job in terms of international expansion and, after launching its asset-light joint venture MOVIN in India last May, the company has quickly expanded it to the 49 largest cities covering ~90% of the B2B marketing opportunity in the country.Overall, I believe the company has good long-term opportunities and the near-term revenues also appear to be bottoming with a potential of the company returning to growth by Q2 next year as the company sees easier comparisons.In Q2 2023, the adjusted operating margin declined 120 bps Y/Y to 13.2% driven by volume deleverage across all segments which more than offset lower purchased transportation costs in Supply Chain Solutions, lower fuel expenses, and the impact of our ongoing productivity initiatives.Looking forward, the company's margin should be under pressure from the recently ratified Teamsters contract at least till August next year when the first year wage and benefit increase under this contract anniversaries. The recent 5-year Teamsters contract includes the highest wage and benefit in the first year and a relatively normal pace of increase after that from Year 2 to Year 4. Since benefits and wages are the largest expense for the company, I don't see the company's productivity and cost-cutting initiatives offsetting it in the near term.This was also my concern when I recommended being on the sidelines in my last article.However, the good news is that the sell-side expectations on margins have come down since my last article and the stock has also corrected meaningfully indicating buy-siders are also already pricing in this headwind.The company has indicated that it plans to undertake significant headcount reductions among its ~140K non-driver employees through automation and sort consolidation and plans to give more details about these initiatives on its March 2024 Investor Day. Management has not given much clarity on it as of now and I will be watching out for management's commentary on it moving forward, but I expect these initiatives to offset labor inflation to a good extent starting Year 2 of the new Teamsters contract. As discussed earlier, the volume should also return to Y/Y growth sometime next year. So, these two factors should help improve margins towards the FY24 year-end and in FY25.UPS is currently trading at 16.43x FY23 consensus EPS estimates of $9.34 and 14.78x FY24 consensus estimates of $10.38. This is a discount versus its 5-year historical average forward P/E of 16.57.I believe the current year EPS will likely mark the bottom-of-the-cycle earnings in the current downturn and valuation on this bottom-of-the-cycle EPS looks attractive. The company also has an attractive 4.21% forward dividend yield.With the stock declining over 15% since my last article, I believe most of the negatives are already priced in at these levels and the return to growth in 2024 along with management commentary about cost-cutting among non-driver jobs on the March 2024 Investor Day may improve investor sentiments and serve as a catalyst for the stock. Hence, I am upgrading my rating to buy.  This article is written by Saloni V. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Exxon Mobil: Big Market Changes,"Exxon Mobil () has long been a leader in accommodating market changes. Some changes are obvious like the increase in the price of oil that should lead to a very good third quarter report as well asThe decrease in the  and light oil prices is currently happening because OPEC (primarily Saudi Arabia when it comes to heavy oil) is cutting back on production as are otherThis movement of oil prices threatens a long-standing US refining industry profit making strategy. For a very long time, the United States has mostly exported the light crude produced by the unconventional wells while importing the heavy oil (even heavy oil with sulfur). The industry then made an ""extra"" profit by upgrading the heavy oil into the same products that were made with light oil while capturing the extra revenue of the discount to the finished product.But when that discount no longer exists, then the industry does not make an extra profit that justifies the assets needed for the extra refining processes. If this was a temporary phenomenon, then investors could put it down to just the usual volatility in pricing that will soon fix itself.But the Canadian completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. Threatens to change this relationship permanently. This long-delayed project is now over . Even with an expected reroute in some places, the pipeline should be in operation within the next couple of years (no guarantees, of course).This will allow a significant amount of Canadian production that was available to the United States with the usual heavy oil discount, to be exported. The volume carried through the pipeline will likely be significant enough to enable the discount between heavy oil and light oil to narrow. It may narrow to the point that the profit the United States has long made on importing heavy oil while exporting light oil will decrease or maybe even disappear.Should that prove to be the case, the refining industry will be in for at least a period of lower profits during cyclical high points.Exxon Mobil normally integrates where it has a decent upstream business. As a general rule, the company builds the upstream business first and then adds other divisions as a value-added way to grow for that particular upstream business.In the case of the Permian, the company may have inadvertently begun a refining trend. expansion is actually the size of most middle-sized refineries (standalone). So, while many talk about the lack of new refineries, the industry is working around that by expanding existing refineries to make up for the lack of new refineries. It gets the industry to the same point as building new refineries.What's even more interesting is that this refinery will handle the light crude that the company produces in the Permian. This is a variance from the industry strategy noted above of exporting the light crude while importing the heavy crude to make a profit on that spread. It could mean that the spread will not be worth the effort in the future. What we will have to see is how many more expansion projects happen with the idea of handling light crude.The third quarter itself is going to benefit from some of the best oil pricing so far in the current fiscal year. Most investors remember that prices peaked roughly in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and it was downhill after that. This year began with a fair amount of pessimism about oil prices despite the fact that the industry by and large, made decent profits at those prices.I have been reporting for some time that well breakeven points have been dropping. That should of course lead to lower corporate breakeven points and a more profitable industry at various oil prices.Exxon Mobil not only benefits from higher prices, but it also benefits from a drive to lower costs. This project has been aided by previously mentioned sales of high-cost production replaced by low-cost Permian production (that the new refinery expansion project will serve. in the next slide that Guyana and the Permian business were growing at roughly a 20% rate. What that is likely to do is begin to slowly turn the expenses (now at zero) favorable in the future.The other thing likely to happen is that unfavorable price effect shown above will likely disappear in the third quarter (or at the very least it won't be as bad as the comparison above which was against the peak pricing last fiscal year).Since oil prices remained relatively weak towards the end of the fiscal year, the comparisons should become easier on the pricing front. In the meantime, management keeps adding new low-cost production while periodically selling the higher-cost production. That is going to widen the company margin even if oil prices veer slightly from expected levels as commodity prices often do.This would include the world-class low breakeven (on Brent pricing) of Guyana:Exxon Mobi of the partnership with Hess () and is the one that is bringing all the projects shown above online. The startup of the Payara FPSO will begin in the fourth quarter. This year benefitted from the first two projects shown above with the Lisa Phase 2 reaching its full potential about six months after startup.Exxon Mobil immediately began to work on debottlenecking projects to allow (eventually) all three FPSO's to process production above the nameplate amounts shown above. Exxon Mobil has also rearranged the production strategy in an attempt to hold down that breakeven point by holding down costs.The production from the numbers above is 620 BOD (as natural gas is reinjected). But that production should grow a good 10% above that and possibly more. In round numbers Exxon Mobil would get 45% of 700,000 BOD which is significant even for a company the size of Exxon Mobil. That number will increase when the next FPSO begins operations in 2025.John Hess also mentioned in the latest conference that the partners have an extra year to make up for fiscal year 2020. The advantage is that they have six ships operating whereas in 2020 they had three ships. This is important because the more acreage that moves into ""developed"" territory, the less acreage remaining will be part of the negotiated giveback to Guyana next year.The expected robust pricing environment may well mean that the partnership would add yet another ship or two depending upon the partners view of oil prices. (The same thing happens with the Permian as higher prices would mean more money to drill.)Exxon Mobil was one of the few companies to drill right through the pandemic when it could. This allowed the company to take advantage of rock bottom prices offshore and on shore. The cost advantages achieved by such a strategy are the same as a competitive moat as those advantages last the life of the well. Offshore, that is one very long life. Onshore is close to the same.Exxon Mobil could be doing the same thing with the refinery expansion as it is adding refinery capacity that can handle light oil at a time when really no many are even thinking about that. Generally, the costs for at least some of the equipment will be low. Exxon Mobil will be done long before the ""mad rush"" to add additional capacity to handle light oil begins.Exxon Mobil will clearly benefit from rising oil prices just like the rest of the industry. But it will also benefit from replacing high cost production with low cost production.In addition, management may be thinking ahead to a time when it no longer benefits the refining industry to handle heavy oil (with or without sulfur). The latest refinery expansion projects will process Permian light oil.The last benefit comes from the fact that in Guyana all potential emissions are reinjected into the reservoir which leads to an industry leading low emissions project. This likewise puts the company in the front of the industry with low emissions that are actually common with offshore projects.Commodity markets change all the time. This is one company that appears to be in front of the changes. That is a very good sign for the future.The company is likely a strong buy consideration in that profits will likely outperform expectations as the cost structure continues to decline. Management has noted in the past that meeting the original goal means that the goals change to accommodate such an accomplishment. So, cost cutting is here to stay for a very long time to come. This company is becoming a growth and income vehicle.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience.

VMware: What China Might Ask Of Broadcom Is Concerning Markets," () saw substantial declines today as the deal spread widened on  for the last leg of the Broadcom ()-VMware deal. We have  in the past, focusing onThey are asking behavioral remedies. It is not clear what these are, and markets are right to be a little concerned since this could interact with the chips ban and other restrictions being placed on sensitive exports to China. Our opinion, although we aren't staking cash on it, is that China won't ask the impossible of Broadcom where it concerns technology sharing and the trade of restricted hardware, as further self-destruction wouldn't be popular. However, the size of theThe extent to which Broadcom has been subject to deteriorating trade relations between China and the U.S. begins with  under President Trump. With the broadening of the list of restricted chip exports to China, and the  of restricting imports by China, the fallout of increasing economic nationalism is impacting VMware today as unclear behavioral remedies are being asked by the SAMR of Broadcom, causing quite a sharp price movement.  Broadcom trades together with other hardware companies around any headlines concerning the chips ban,  that could conceivably be restricted in trade.To be clear, the VMware concerns cover an expansion into cloud offerings, and doesn't have an impact on the hardware profile of the combined entity to a great degree. In principle, SAMR should only be addressing legitimate concerns around the cloud offering and the impacts of the merger on . But the pretty meaningful decline and widening of the deal spread reflect the scenarios considered by speculators where maybe China, through SAMR, in its recent spate of economically nationalistic policies, risks asking too much of Broadcom, even , where the deal can no longer close. Investors who believe that this is impossible on the basis of espoused scopes and independence of Chinese institutions are introducing an unnecessary blind spot.However, there is apparently reporting from  that possible state-wide objectives aren't getting in the way as of now, and that the deal should close relatively on schedule, if not by the end of October as planned then in November. Behavioral remedies should include run-of-the-mill considerations. In our original article on the deal, we focused on the matter that Broadcom is usually pretty aggressive in restructuring its acquisitions, so requests may be around firing employees in China, especially as macroeconomic concerns in China, particularly around reported unemployment, are quite intense at the moment. In general, the already painful effects of some deglobalization after the Ukraine war on China, which remains in the same orbit as Russia, has been a deterrent of aggressively decaying relations where restrictions in trade have for the most part been unilateral on the side of the West, with China's retaliatory options limited primarily to some protectionism around fertilizers and some import restrictions on less critical hardware like that of Micron's ().An unsophisticated summary could be just that China risks being spiteful as far as it concerns this deal, and may use the SAMR and some competitive concerns to tank the deal. It could even be a strategic move depending how you look at it, and it's also not an excessive blow to the U.S. trade situation where it would warrant meaningful response by the U.S. government. It would only really affect VMware's share price which has benefited from substantial upward drift as the deal nears its close with the deal spread now being around $17.As economic nationalism has been a key theme for the 2022-2023 markets, traders are right to be concerned, and are likely pricing the risks to a reasonable degree. We still think the deal should close, as it would be an aggravating move by China, but on a probabilistic basis VMware, Inc. is probably not a screaming buy opportunity, either.If you thought our angle on this company was interesting, you may want to check out our idea room, .

Better High Yield Buy: Energy Transfer Or MPLX," () and  () are both high-yield BBB-rated midstream infrastructure businesses. Many investors prefer MPLX given that its distribution growth track record is much more consistent than ET's. Note that MPLX's large jump andThat said, ET has significantly outperformed MPLX in the nearly three years since we added it to our portfolio:In this article, we compare them side by side and offer our take on which is the best buy right now.MPLX owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure andMPLX's assets are typically strategically located within or close to Marathon Petroleum refineries and typically serve as the sole providers for the refinery's specific needs, creating economic barriers to entry for competitors. Moreover, MPLX's long-term 5-10-year contracts with minimum volume commitments for each Marathon asset give it a very stable cash flow profile, regardless of macro conditions in the energy industry and the broader economy.ET, meanwhile, owns and operates an extensive network of natural gas transportation pipelines, including interstate natural gas pipelines, storage facilities, and gathering and processing assets in multiple states. ET also sells natural gas to various customers, including utilities, power plants, and industrial users. Additionally, the company is involved in crude oil transportation, terminalling, and marketing activities, as well as the distribution of petroleum products such as gasoline and motor fuels. It also offers services related to natural gas compression, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide removal, and manages coal and natural resource properties. Unlike MPLX, ET does not have a parent that owns a large stake in it, nor is it beholden to a single large customer.Furthermore, ET has a much larger asset portfolio with an enterprise value that is nearly twice that of MPLX's. Moreover, it generates at least 11% and no more than 28% of its adjusted EBITDA from each of its five business segments (crude oil, NGL & refined products, natural gas interstate transport & storage, midstream, and natural gas intrastate transport & storage), giving it greater diversification than MPLX. Similar to MPLX, however, is the fact that it generates the vast majority of its cash flow (~90% of expected adjusted 2023 EBITDA) from commodity price-resistant long-term fee-based contacts. As such, it has a fairly defensive business model that is quite resilient in the face of macro volatility.One important item to note is that - apart from a sharp dip during part of the COVID-19 and Saudi-Russian oil price war-induced energy market crash of 2020 - MPLX has consistently generated significantly better returns on capital than ET has. This indicates that its management team has been a better capital allocator than ET's has over the years:Both businesses have been deleveraging in recent years, and both have BBB credit ratings with stable outlooks from S&P.ET's leverage ratio is now under its 4.5x long-term target and is likely to stay within the 4.0x-4.5x range for the foreseeable future depending on capital allocation opportunities for ET relative to the attractiveness of retiring rather than refinancing upcoming debt maturities.One major positive for ET is that it is expected to generate between $1.7-$1.8 billion in free cash flow net of distributions in 2024, ~$2.4 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2025, ~$3.1 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2026, and ~$3.5 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2027. This should enable it to cover most - if not all - of its upcoming debt maturities over that period of time. As a result, it enjoys significant flexibility in the face of growing uncertainty about the future outlook for interest rates. As a result, we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution level.MPLX, meanwhile, has an even lower leverage ratio of 3.5x, down from 3.7x two years ago and 4.0x four years ago. Moreover, it has well-balanced and very manageable debt maturities in the coming years. Similar to ET, it is expected to generate very healthy levels of free cash flow net of distributions over that time period as well. It is expected to generate ~$1.2-$1.4 billion in free cash flow net of distributions each year through 2027, equating to a little over $5 billion in free cash flow net of distributions over that span. In comparison, it has about $6 billion in debt maturing over that period, giving it significant capital markets flexibility and minimal need to access bond markets if it chooses not to in the face of rising interest rates. As a result, as with ET, we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution level.As already pointed out, both distributions appear to be on very sound footing thanks to the stable cash flow profiles and strong balance sheets for both businesses. Moreover, MPLX is expected to cover its distribution by 1.56x this year and ET is expected to cover its distribution by 1.95x this year, giving both distributions very adequate coverage.Through 2027, MPLX is expected to grow its distribution at a 5.0% CAGR while ET is expected to grow its distribution at a 4.3% CAGR. ET's distribution is likely going to grow at a slower pace than MPLX's because it has more growth opportunities in front of it, so management will be investing in those instead. That being said, it is interesting to note that ET is only expected to grow its DCF per unit at a 4% CAGR over that span whereas MPLX is expected to grow its DCF per unit at a nearly as strong 3.4% pace despite growing its distribution faster and not retaining nearly as much cash as ET is expected to. This is because MPLX tends to generate higher returns on its capital, thereby reducing its need to retain as much cash flow as ET does in order to deliver similar growth rates.ET appears to be significantly cheaper than MPLX on an EV/EBITDA and on a P/DCF basis, though both offer near identical current distribution yields.ET appears to be the winner here given that it is significantly cheaper than MPLX and its portfolio is also quite a bit more diversified. However, MPLX has generated consistently better returns on capital over the course of its history, its distribution payout has proven to be more consistent, and has grown at a faster clip over the long term. Moreover, MPLX currently offers the same yield as ET and is expected to grow its distribution at a slightly faster clip moving forward while also having a significantly lower leverage ratio. As a result, we can definitely see the case for holding MPLX over ET.However, what gives ET the edge in our view is that it is not beholden to a parent/major client like MPLX is to MPC. Between its greater portfolio diversification, a wider array of growth projects, significantly cheaper valuation, and better governance structure, we give the edge to ET, though we rate both as Buys.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Dividend Investor's Natural Gas Export Playbook - Part 1,"Over the next 5 years, a multitude of natural gas export terminals are scheduled to commence operations. This will expand exported volumes of liquified natural gas (LNG) from roughly 14 BCF/d to over 26.5 BCF/day by 2030. The first projects (shown below)are slatedA secondary round of projects that have reached FID will also serve to ensure these are not just one-off events. These supplementary projects will progressAs investors, this is an important market dynamic that can be captured for monetary gain. This can be done in several ways, but also needs to be identified BEFORE the molecules start flowing. In that vein I decided to start a new series to explore how investors can benefit from a variety of investments at different points in the natural gas value chain.This series will explore and compare both the income and growth aspects of what I consider the top two candidates in several sectors. This series will be broken into at least four segments with a possible fifth reserved for honorable mentions based on reader feedback in the comment sections.Ultimately a diversified portfolio of these companies will allow investors to capitalize on all aspects of the value chain without relying on a single company to outperform the market. Identifying these companies early and developing some sense of value will improve our odds of success while also allowing the opportunity to maximize both income and appreciation over the long term.Let's get started with the first part of this series with my top two picks for natural gas producers.Our first group will experience the highest degree of volatility. These stocks often trade following crude prices. In many respects this is illogical and can be frustrating to the common shareholder. We however need to be trained to identify when this illogical behavior is occurring and how to exploit it. Buying into weakness both decreases our risk but boosts yield and capital gain potential.Chesapeake () operates out of two major natural gas basins, the Marcellus and Haynesville basins. The production is split between the two basins with 45% of the production coming from the Haynesville and 55% from the Marcellus.This split provides valuable market diversification. The Marcellus is well positioned with excellent economics and located ideally to service the bulk of the US Northeast where a significant portion of the US population resides for consumption associated with heating and electricity production. Western Europe is also a potential sales point to help replace the supplies that are no longer available from Russia via the  in Maryland.Meanwhile, CHK's Haynesville acreage provides some counterbalance to the steady profile of the Marcellus. CHK is operating under the model of being ""LNG Ready"", which indicates the purposeful and tactical investment to capitalize on the upcoming expansion of LNG exports. CHK is emphasizing prudent capital investment in this shale to flex its muscles only when demand signals are created by these export terminals becoming operational.CHK's Haynesville acreage is ideally located near the US gulf coast that is being slowly cultivated to ensure it is ready to capitalize on the robust demand that will unfold over the next 5 years and beyond. CHK has guided for reduced rig counts for the duration of 2023 to allow the Haynesville to operate at or below maintenance levels of activity.In the meantime, the company is working on optimizing its asset. CHK is trading acreage to allow for longer drilling laterals, building out midstream assets, and arranging long term contracts with customers. Specifically, CHK has contracted with Gunvor, a commodity trading company, to allow exposure to the  for natural gas, which historically trades at prices significantly higher than US markets.Additionally, CHK has agreed to be a 35% equity partner with Momentum Sustainable Ventures for the construction and operation of a 1.7 BCF/d natural gas pipeline to deliver its product from the Haynesville shale to the gulf coast. This pipeline schedule to complete at the end of 2024 and is expandable up to 2.2 BCF/d. Having an ownership stake in the pipeline will ensure the CHK has offtake capabilities, as well as a cost-effective delivery system.Everyone is familiar with the phrase, ""It takes money, to make money"". Any producer that is going ramp up production will need to invest heavily in drilling wells and building the associated infrastructure. This obviously can be a short-term stressor to the balance sheet of any company. Having a robust balance sheet will allow CHK to have a shock absorber to weather the current depressed natural gas market.With a $2.0 billion credit revolver, and nearly $900 million in cash, CHK is also equipped to be able to invest when called upon. When the market needs more gas, it will be able to answer that call. Additionally, with no debt maturities in 2023, 2024, or 2025, there is nothing to rob the company of its momentum as it heads into this potential market upswing.CHK has employed the variable shareholder return model that is becoming increasingly popular in the E&P space. This model utilizes a base dividend plus a variable component. This variable component alternates between variable dividend or share repurchases depending on the point in the operating cycle.When the share price is elevated due to high commodity prices (think mid to late 2022), shareholders will receive 50% of the remaining free cash flow as an additional dividend. In periods of depressed share prices, the company will divert the excess FCF toward share repurchases.The base dividend is competitive with the general market, coming in at $2.30/share annually or 2.7%, with the potential to become significantly higher if natural gas prices rebound. Currently, CHK projects a $2.40/MCF breakeven price to sustain the base dividend, which the current market supports.In contrast,  while experiencing record natural gas prices. This creates somewhat of a boom/bust dynamic that must be fully understood prior to initiating a position with CHK. It also stresses the importance of getting in early at the bottom of the cycle.The exponential factor of the above chart should not be underestimated. Using the  of nearly $4.00/MCF, you can see that a 60% increase from today's prices ($2.50/MCF to $4.00/MCF) will yield roughly 325% increase in FCF to $6.8 billion. This level of FCF generation is supportive of significant growth in the dividend through the variable dividend.It is also important to note that even before the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, natural gas prices averaged roughly $4.00/mcf in 2021. Given the projected increase in demand, the $4.00/mcf mark looks to be a realistic number long term. Comparable performance for CHK would be the , where the realized price was limited to $4.03/MCF. The table below shows proof of the exponential factor I discussed earlier. Even a moderate rise to $4.00 has a dramatic impact.By comparison, most of the independent oil producers such as Devon Energy, Diamondback Energy, or Pioneer Natural Resources trade on a rough multiple of about 8 times earnings. To account for the volatility that natural gas will experience, I would base an investment on obtaining a long term average quarterly EPS of $4.50/share, and an earnings multiple of 6. This conservatively implies a price of $108/share and therefore, I believe CHK is significantly undervalued at current prices.Black Stone () is a slightly different take on the producer space. First off, it is not a producer at all, but a royalty company. Secondly,  of its revenue comes from the sales of crude oil, not natural gas. However, BSM is making a dedicated effort to make sure its natural gas resources carry their own weight. In the image below you can see that the Haynesville shale makes up a significant portion of its total acreage, and thus carries significant potential.It is important to note that as a royalty partnership, the company has little to no capital expenses to foster growth. It needs to structure deals with producers in a way that is mutually beneficial to drill on their land. This aspect creates a different dynamic than investors are used to in the E&P space.Note: BSM is a publicly traded partnership and issues a K-1 tax form which has different tax treatment than a 1099-DIV.BSM's management has very creatively structured deals with producers to foster growth starting back in 2020. Blackstone has partnered with natural gas producer Aethon Energy to ensure gas flows out of its Haynesville acreage.In 2020 it signed agreements to give Aethon Energy exclusive access to its Angelina County acreage and reduced royalties in exchange for contracted well development . In 2021, a follow up agreement was signed for BSM's San Augustine County acreage through 2031. Both of these footprints are in the Haynesville Basin.To ensure the acreage is developed and the wells are tapped to become productive, BSM structured a deal Aethon Energy can't refuse. Black Stone partners with 3rd parties to foot the development costs for Aethon. In exchange for this upfront capital expense, the 3rd party gets a fraction of the working interests in the well's productivity. Blackstone is willing to share a portion of its royalty income in exchange for contracted development on its acreage.The Aethon development agreements are summarized below. These provide predictable revenue streams for BSM.BSM pays a traditional dividend of $0.475/unit that sports an eye-popping yield of nearly 11%. The immediate reaction is to view this as unsustainable, which in some respects, isn't far from the truth.For the first two quarters of 2023, the , which is alarmingly low. The biggest knock on BSM in 2023 has been that it is relying on its hedging program to generate sufficient revenue to support the dividend. However, now that oil has recovered from its June lows, the firm should have significant breathing room.Turning to 2024, some challenges may arise due to a tightening hedge program. However, only half of its crude and two-thirds of its natural gas is hedged. There are multiple drivers that will ensure BSM's profitability remains intact.1.OPEC+ is determined to keep crude over $80/barrel with production cuts. The unhedged portion will still be exposed to this upside.2. 20 natural gas wells are contractually required to be completed in 2023, followed by an additional 25 in 2024. These additional volumes will provide incremental profits.3. BSM is debt free to ensure a lean operating profile.So far, we have detailed mechanisms that BSM has to be able to sustain the current dividend and possibly grow its revenue base due to expanding natural gas production. To compound on this, BSM entered into an agreement with Longroad Energy to  on its property in a mineral rights deal. This provides the company with another potential source of revenue growth.With those factors in mind, I believe BSM is more likely to grow in the medium to long term than it is to contract. I therefore view BSM as being fairly valued on a risk adjusted basis. Any pullback under $17/share would be a buying opportunity.Natural gas has a variety of uses that more often than not, are impacted by the weather. This results in a very high level of volatility that often exceeds that of crude oil. As shown below, natural gas prices have swung over 200% since the beginning of 2021, while crude experienced only a 100% swing over that same time frame.This dynamic can cause periods of extreme highs and extreme lows. Investors must plan on them being a reality and be prepared to stomach the rollercoaster. As mentioned, CHK has seen its annual dividend fluctuate from nearly $10/share to now a meager $2.30/share, so the volatility will show up in your pocketbook as well.Buying now at the bottom of the cycle will help minimize risk. I recommend due to the level of volatility they create, that producers account for only 20-30% of your energy portfolio. If this level of volatility is too high for your personal tastes, I would recommend looking into a more oil focused producer that still has natural gas exposure. My favorites in this category are Devon Energy () and Pioneer Natural Resources ().In Part 1 of my natural gas playbook, we have explored two vastly different takes on natural gas production. Chesapeake Energy is a pure natural gas play that has the acreage and balance sheet to ramp up production when the market signals it is ready to pay up for its product. The variable dividend policy will give the company the tools to handsomely reward shareholders when profits start to rise in next 12 to 18 months.My second candidate was slightly off the beaten path by exploring a royalty play in Black Stone Minerals. BSM has a healthy exposure to both natural gas and oil, so it is not a pure play on natural gas. BSM has the acreage and contracts in place with drillers to ensure its properties are tapped and cash flowing when natural gas exports start pulling molecules out of the Haynesville shale.In Part 2, I will explore the midstream sector that will serve as an anchor to our energy portfolio.

Frontera Energy: In A Buy Zone At Current Prices,"The last few months have been hard on  (), a Canadian based E&P company with principal operations in Latin America. We have , andThat recommendation hasn't aged well, as it came within a few weeks of a top set on April, 6th of 2022, and it's been largely downhill ever since. Oil price fluctuations, political adversity in-country, and increasing capital outlay on the Corentyne block, offshore Guyana, operated by CGX Energy. Anyone considering FECCF should also read  on CGX Energy (Here we sit nearing $8.00 for FECCF, down about 30% YoY from the last report. FECCF's largest shareholder has indicated an interest in , which totals about 40.84% of the company, and probably puts a drag on shares, of top of all the other lead weights dragging it down. This is well off the  for a low of $9.57 and a high of $11.88, leading perhaps to the conclusion that the market is mispricing FECCF. We will make that determination as we close out this review.The company has a troubled outlook in its principal operations in Colombia, as the country is turning its back on hydrocarbons. Late last year, the country's new president, Gustavo Petro was quoted in anthat suggested the industry's days were numbered in the country-There is a ray of hope for Frontera's current, widely distributed Columbian operations, as the Petro government is  to oil companies to continue investing in producing fields. A neat way of sidestepping the ""no new"" licenses dictum to address the country's compelling need for oil exports and the revenue they bring. It should be noted that the company is forging ahead on their current operations as  in their Q-2, 2023 call. We will touch on this later in the article.If you look at the right side of the company footprint, you will see the primary reason to be interested in Frontera. Of course, we are talking about the company's stake in CGX Energy and the potential for a big payday in Guyana's Corentyne Block.Not the least of the impetus for the interest in the FECCF/CGX two discovery wells is the success Exxon Mobil Corporation () has had a little farther to the north. XOM has made discovery after discovery and floated two FPSO projects, now cranking out 400K BOEPD, with a third sanctioned and on the way. Based on the 11 bn barrels of recoverable OIP discovered by XOM, the  have been likened to West Africa twenty years ago.As noted in the recent APA Corp article, the trend established by XOM's Stabroek discoveries, established a ""fairway"" for oil discoveries that now are proven to extend into Suriname.There are probably more people drumming their fingers, waiting for some news...that surely must come soon, on the eventual update from Frontera and CGX on the outcome of the analytical work be done on the Santonian samples, and news that shopping the project to potential ""Big Daddies,"" able to bear the cost of development is finally bearing fruit, than any other project in the world. The suspense is killing us, but there is total radio silence about testing results. Christine Guerrero, whom we interviewed in the last CGX article, was on the call, and pushed-Like I said, radio silence. Nice try, Christine.Although CGX is nominally the operator, Frontera has a lot to say as it is largely their capital on the line. CGX with no revenues has needed Frontera to advance costs of drilling these two wells-Kawa#1, and Wei#1, and in so doing has ceded 72.7% of the project to them. Worth noting is that Frontera owns nearly all of the common stock of CGX, There is also other activity in the area.  targeting the same gassy sand package found in Haimara #1. Guyana is determined to begin monetizing gas discoveries, and the XOM may need to install infrastructure that could end up advantaging other operators, like Frontera and CGX. A confirmation of further reserves in the area would be supportive of CGX's/Frontera's positive stance toward the eventual development of the block. are evaluating next steps on the Kanuku Block, following poor drilling results. Some of this could revolve around the Guyanese governments , now expired for the block.Finally, awards for the just concluded  in Guyana are pending, with the awards due November, 1st. This round attracted  in the 14 blocks, eight of which received offers.I think we are fairly well updated on Guyana now, let's have a look at FECCF's ongoing operations and financials.Frontera upped daily production by 1% to approximately 42,000 BOE per day for the quarter. At CPE-6, they recently achieved daily record production of 6,177 barrels per day. Capex of approximately $155 million was deployed primarily to drill 19 development wells at Quifa, CPE-6 and Cubiro, improve flow lines, build a storage tank and other facilities to double water handling capacity at CPE-6, drill two exploration wells in Colombia and complete Wei-1 exploration drilling activity.In Ecuador, Frontera’s net was 613 barrels per day of medium crude oil for the three months ended June 30 compared to 1,005 barrels in the prior quarter. On the Perico block, Frontera drilled the G2 appraisal well in July, discovering 48 feet of net pay in the Lower U sand and 24 feet net pay in the Hollin main formation. The well has been successfully completed with initial production rates of approximately 1,200 barrels or 30.5-degree API crude oil. Preparations are underway for the of drilling the Jandiayacu exploration well, which the company expected to spud in August.Frontera also has a midstream business that is constructing a link between their liquids terminal in Puerto Bahia, and EcoPetrol's refinery in Reficar. Construction of the connection is expected to begin in the second half of this year and take approximately 12 to 18 months to complete a unanticipated total cost of approximately $30 million, and a capacity of 84K BOPD.In Q2 the company recorded net income of roughly $80 million, which compared with a net loss of $11.3 million in the prior quarter. The company's second quarter net income included $35.5 million of a net recovery from asset retirement obligations and impairment expenses, resulting mainly from the company's sale of its interest and asset in the Z1 block and the corresponding reduction in asset retirement obligations related to such block.EBITDA for the quarter was $116.5 million compared to $92 million in the first quarter. This represents a 27% increase in quarter-over-quarter operating EBITDA, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes during the quarter and the realized gain on their asset risk management contract.On the cost side, production and transportation cost per barrel totaled approximately $14 and $11.40, respectively. This compares to $12 and $11.20 in the first quarter. The increase in costs quarter-over-quarter was primarily a result of foreign exchange impact related to the almost 10% appreciation of the Colombian peso during the quarter, also impacting higher energy and internal transportation costs and additional costs related to additional activity for services.Cash generation for the quarter was strong with cash from operations totaling $184 million compared with approximately $1 million in the prior quarter. From an investment standpoint, the company spent $154.9 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, including $72.8 million related to the Guyana Wei-1 exploration well. The company expects to be in the lower end of the capital guidance of approximately $190 million to $195 million for the full year.Frontera reported cash on the  of $214 million compared to $183 million as of the first quarter of 2023. Frontera also uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to oil price and foreign exchange volatility. As of Q2, the company had placed new put hedges totaling roughly 2.1 million barrels or roughly 40% of their production for the year, at prices between $70 and $79 per Brent barrel. Frontera has also entered into FX rate hedges totaling roughly $120 million or approximately 40% of their estimated peso exposure for the second half of 2023..Other than the flux induced by the potential for sale of Catalyst Capital's Frontera's shares, the key risk revolves around continued funding of appraisal wells for the Corentyne block. Further delineation is required to establish the size of the reservoir as well as its quality. Frontera has been fronting these expenses and it's cut their cash reserves in half over the last couple of years. Higher oil prices in Q3 may mitigate this somewhat, but what is needed is an outside investor who can shoulder the burden. A burden that could run to another half a billion dollars based on sunk costs for two initial wells.Frontera is a largely well run E&P with more than the usual share of problems impacting the stock. The new government in Colombia has sent a chill through the investment community, at least with respect to oil and gas development. As noted there seems to be some recognition of that fact, but it's made people leery of investing there.In spite of all the activity in the general area of Corentyne, none of the key players, TotalEnergies (), Hess (), or Exxon Mobil () has stepped forward. It's a little disconcerting, as it could be easily had for a song. Frontera's market cap is $653 mm. Some of this could be explained by the fact they all have significant investments in the country currently. There are other companies coming into the picture, Malaysian operator, Petronas () as an example, or CNOOC () - which participates in the Stabroek block, and a number of others.This is not to diminish the work Frontera and CGX have done. There's just more to do to pretty up Corentyne for ""adoption"" by a Big Daddy.Frontera trades at attractive multiples. 1.3X- EV/EBITDA on a TTM basis, and $23K per flowing barrel. It has a solid balance sheet with LT Debt less than one net turn of EBITDA, meaning the company can easily repay it from cash flow. Particularly as Q-3, realizations should be at least 20% above Q-2 results.My take is that for investors with a huge risk tolerance, and let's understand most of the risk comes from being stalled out on Guyana, FECCF is in a buy zone. I think the Colombian government is already  from the initial pronouncement about new petroleum licenses. I expect somebody with a ledger book elbowed his way into El Presidente's office and had brief chat about finances. Once a wall begins to crumble, it's not long until it tumbles down. That development could certainly boost the stock. The current 1.3X multiple is absurdly low and represents the present view of risk associated with Colombia.News of a farm in by one of the big guys would also rocket the stock. I am long CGX and may consider taking a position in Frontera Energy Corporation. I think the positives for further development are strong enough that a white knight will eventually step, in causing a complete rerating for the stock.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Energy Transfer: Strong Income Generator Amid Uncertain Times,"I last wrote on Energy Transfer () a bit more than three months ago (see the chart below). The  argued for a buyFast-forward to now, the stock has indeed delivered strong returns against an overall market decline. To wit, the stock has enjoyed aDespite the price rally, I see the stock as an even stronger buy at this point, and consequently, this article will upgrade my rating to Strong Buy. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on two of my key considerations for my upgraded rating. First, I will argue that a few new catalysts have happened since then, and they can provide ET with a better growth potential. Second, because of such a better growth potential, the stock valuation has actually become even more discounted from the Graham P/E.Oil prices have recovered strongly since my last article. As seen from the chart below, Brent futures were in the $75 range at that time. It has since then reached a peak of almost $100 and currently hovers around $87. Now, I see a couple of catalysts to keep oil prices (or energy/commodity prices in general) elevated and provide a tailwind for ET in the near future.The most important catalyst in my view, sadly, is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. In general, geopolitical risks tend to increase demand for oil and commodities for several reasons. Geopolitical conflicts tend to disrupt supply, transportation, and global trading. At the same time, both the general public and investors may seek to store more commodities as a hedge against the ongoing geopolitical conflicts.Specific to the Israel-Hamas conflict, I see more immediate impacts on oil and energy prices. The conflict could have nonlinear ramifications on other countries in the Middle Eastern region, many of which are important oil production/export countries. Iran is the first specific example that came to my mind. Iran is a significant oil production country and also a known supporter of Hamas. As such, it's a possible scenario, in my view, we could see a tightening of restrictions on Iranian oil exports.Admittedly, these catalysts are relevant to the general energy sector and won't only serve as a tailwind for ET. However, I will argue that thanks to a few differentiating factors, ET is better positioned to navigate the ramifications of such geopolitical events than the sector average. The top differentiators are its scale and integrated operations. ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. Its assets are highly integrated, which allows it to achieve significant operational efficiencies. For example, its pipeline network connects production areas to processing facilities and storage terminals, which allows the company to move products quickly and efficiently to market.This unique strength has provided ET with the resilience to deliver strong results amid market turmoil. The following chart shows its recent dividend payouts as a reflection of such resilience. As seen, the dividend amount has recovered very quickly since the COVID-19 pandemic. It increased rapidly from $0.175 per share in the first quarter of 2022 to $0.31 per share at this point. This represents an increase of approximately 77%, and its current payout already is higher than its pre-pandemic level of $0.305 per share.The stock is currently yielding 9.06% on an FWD basis. Such a high yield, when combined with its resilience and discounted valuation (argued next), makes it a strong income generator in uncertain times like this.For the valuation of a ""traditional"" business like ET, I will follow the Graham approach as detailed in his book (Intelligent Investor). In particular, I will start with the so-called Graham P/E. As detailed in my earlier article:In ET's case, consensus estimates project an EPS growth rate of ~1% CAGR at the time of my original article. The above projection was too pessimistic in my view. But even with a 1% growth rate, its Graham P/E would be 10.5x. At that time, the stock was trading around a P/E of 9.06x, about 14% below the Graham P/E. Now, due to the recovery of commodities prices and the other catalysts mentioned above,  have upped the growth projection in the next few years to 3.0% as seen in the chart below.With this new growth rate, the discount has become larger despite the price rallies since as shown in my next table. As seen, its market P/E is about 10.22x currently, about 29% lower than the Graham P/E. There are a few other risks both in the upward and downward directions that are worth mentioning. In the upward direction, ET's assets are primarily located in the United States, which makes ET less exposed to the risks associated with geopolitical conflicts in other parts of the world than the sector average. Furthermore, its revenue model is primarily fee based. It charges a fee for transporting, storing, and processing energy products for its customers. As such, its revenue model is less exposed to geopolitical events should they take an unexpected turn.In the downside direction, the  shows a smaller discount, as you can see from my analyses table above. The Graham P/E only takes into consideration the EPS, while the Graham number considers both the earnings and the book value. As such, the fact that the Graham number shows a smaller discount implies that the market is giving its assets a more favorable price than its earnings. But still, the Graham number also shows a sizable valuation discount of 16%.To conclude, despite the price rally since my last writing, I view ET as an even stronger buy under current conditions. The main factors involved in this upgrading are twofold. First, I see new catalysts that can support a better growth potential (and so do consensus estimates). Second, because of the better growth potential, I see its valuation as more discounted now compared to the time of my last writing.As you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

The Higher-Rates Narrative: A Rebuttal,"Ten-year Treasury yields have increased dramatically over the last few months, rising from a low of 3.4% in May of 2023 to a whopping 4.5% by the end of September. Alongside this run-up in rates has been the emergence of aInvestors thinking about how to allocate their assets between equities and U.S. Treasuries, or fixed income securities more broadly, have to understand the higher-rates narrative, and then decide if they believe it. Those who subscribe to the narrative may not find Treasuries attractive, because rates could continue to increase, thus driving down bond prices. Those investors who believe the opposing narrative -- thatWith this dilemma facing investors in mind, I go through the hedge fund higher-rates narrative and argue that, while the hedge fund camp’s arguments are certainly compelling, there is a more compelling set of counterarguments for why rates are currently too high.To better understand the issues involved, let's now dive into Ackman's higher-rates thesis.Ackman starts out his piece with the following (I rearrange the order of some of the statements from the tweet to maintain a better discussion flow):The peace dividend is hardly gone. Though there are many tragic counterexamples, the global trend towards  that started in the wake of the Second World War is still in place to all of our benefit. It is true that outsourcing to China is being reduced – to a large extent because  – but global trade and outsourcing , with some countries like Mexico and Vietnam benefiting from the pivot away from China. While there is evidence that these trends are leading to wage pressures in the U.S., this is more of a slow transition away from China than an abrupt shift towards deglobalization. Furthermore, the current UAW strike targeting Detroit’s big three is driven largely by the union’s attempt to  given to the auto manufacturers during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), rather than an inflation-triggered demand for higher wages. Given the concession catalyst for the UAW strike, it is far from clear whether workers in other industries will follow suit or whether they have enough leverage to do so.Energy prices rise and fall with regularity. Looking at the last 20 years of WTI prices shows no evidence of a trend towards higher real oil prices, though there are many fluctuations over that time. It is a market heavily influenced by OPEC, and it is hard to imagine that OPEC will not face pressure to increase production should oil prices go substantially above $100 per barrel. In addition, U.S. shale becomes very profitable at these , which naturally brings supply back into the market. The SPR has, indeed, been , and this will lead to price-supportive demand in the oil market. But the logical conclusion of the sentence that “Energy prices are rising rapidly” is that this rise will at some point be arrested by market and geopolitical forces.Ackman then points to the green energy transition, which will certainly be expensive, as a force that will lead to increasing inflation expectations.While inflationary expectations may rise in the future for a host of reasons, they are currently under control and inflation expectations have not contributed to the recent increase in rates. The current rise in rates is entirely driven by an increase in real rates, as inflation breakevens have stayed largely unchanged, presumably because the market believes the Fed will succeed in its inflation fight.Consumer inflation expectation surveys also point to moderating inflation.The evidence for rising inflationary expectations is not there. Inflation expectations – market- and survey-based – are falling.Our national debt is rising, as is public debt globally. According to an , the U.S. is not a particular outlier among advanced economies. There has been a secular increase in public debt to GDP globally for the last 60 years, a time of secularly declining interest rates. This suggests there is no mechanical relationship between national debt to GDP and the level of rates. (In fact, debt levels have been , likely a reflection of a more stable and robust financial system which can produce and monitor higher amounts of debt.) As is widely known, Japan has much higher debt to GDP than the U.S., and has substantially lower interest rates and ongoing struggles with deflation.An important point is that there is nothing magical about the 100% debt-to-GDP level. Debt is a stock and GDP is a flow, and a better comparison might be between the U.S. debt level and present value of all future GDP, which would make our debt level look miniscule by comparison.This is not to say that fiscal discipline does not matter. It does. Furthermore, I concede the point that persistent government threats to default on national debt are very detrimental to investor confidence, especially in the long-run. As I’ve  in the past, our government would do well to put in place a system where these political hijinks don’t allow for the U.S. to default on our debt obligations.The post then turns to the topic of the high U.S. debt load:There is a large literature in macroeconomics documenting the dollar’s unique role as a global reserve currency. China’s selling of U.S. debt – which is likely being done to  rather than as a loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar – is unlikely to . In fact, the U.S. dollar has appreciated alongside the increase in 10-year Treasury rates, suggesting that dollar outflows are not causing the rate increases.This is true, but as the next chart illustrates real GDP growth and 10-year Treasury yields have not had a particularly tight relationship historically, though they began to comove more after the Global Financial Crisis. Typically, real growth has run at a lower level than 10-year rates, though since the GFC, this has not been true. Part of the reason is that, after the Global Financial Crisis, Treasury yields fell to reflect increased investor demand for Treasuries as disaster-risk hedges. The currently higher level of 10-year rates relative to lagged GDP growth is anomalous in the post-GFC era.Another take on whether positive economic sentiment is responsible for the rates increase compares the San Francisco Fed’s  (extracted from the economic coverage of 24 major U.S. newspapers) to the level of 10-year Treasury yields. While both news sentiment and rates have increased from their 2020 COVID lows, the current increase in rates far outpaces the rise in economic sentiment from major U.S. newspapers, which calls into question the causal impact of beliefs about future economic growth on the increase in interest rates.U.S. PCE inflation (the Fed’s ) has hovered around the 2% level in the 1950s and early 1960s, with a noted increase in the 1970s, following that decade’s oil price shocks, that lasted until the 1990s, after which PCE inflation dropped back to the 2% level. 2% is an admittedly arbitrary level, but so is any other one. And the Fed and ECB have both decided 2% is the right number. Given that inflation is about expectations, and that the two largest global central banks have decided 2% is the right level for these expectations, it is hard to imagine why any other arbitrary number would be less arbitrary than 2%. Furthermore, while the world is surely very different now, many of the differences – like technological progress and increased efficiencies – are deflationary (look at the inflation experience of Japan and now ).No doubt heavy issuance is a concern for fixed income managers. At some point, if issuance becomes sufficiently heavy, the yield demanded by investors to buy the new debt will be so high that companies will find it uneconomic to raise capital. The fact that issuance is heavy means that there are buyers out there who are willing to buy bonds at interest rate levels that companies are willing to pay. This is market clearing. If the above-mentioned manager stepped away, and others did the same, issuance levels would immediately drop. That this isn’t happening means that, as some managers step away, others step in to absorb the issuance, believing that the rates being offered are sufficiently attractive.Technicals are a fickle friend. If many hedge funds subscribe to the higher-rates thesis and have expressed these views through derivatives and levered short bets – as seems likely – then the technicals supporting rate rises can easily turn and a short squeeze can quickly push rates back down.There were many compelling arguments made over the prior decade about why rates may now be in a permanently lower state (for example, this  talks about the impact of demographics on the level of rates). Giving markets a bit of credit, after many years of low rates with the associated narratives for why they are so low, it is not surprising, and perhaps also not wrong, that investors felt that buying Treasuries at 4% yields was attractive. Many still , and time will tell whether or not they will be proven wrong.According to , nominal rates contain several components: a term reflecting economic growth (higher growth, higher rates), a term reflecting the use of Treasuries to provide tail risk hedges (more hedging demand, lower rates), a term premium which justifies why 10-year rates are on average higher than shorter-dated rates, an inflation expectation term (higher inflation, higher nominal rates), and an inflation risk premium (more concern about inflation, higher nominal rates). Depending on one’s assumptions, this decomposition can lead to a range of possible rate outcomes, and it is not clear why 5.5% if the unique outcome of this exercise.Furthermore, it is not obvious that the world is “increasingly risky.” Relative to the vast majority of distant and recent human history, the human condition is now . There are surely many problems – war in Ukraine, China-Taiwan dispute, climate change, disease, to mention a few – but the list of dimensions across which the human condition is better is innumerably long. One could more reasonably argue that the world is getting progressively safer, not riskier.Globally, interest rates have been steadily declining since the 1970s. Beliefs that were formed in prior years have surely been revised downward over time.I would not so readily dismiss AI as a transformative force in the coming years. But don't just take my word for it. Take a look at this  from McKinsey or this  from the Brookings Institution to see what the experts are saying about an impending AI-powered productivity boom.The case for higher rates can be made across multiple dimensions:However, across all these dimensions, there are compelling counterarguments that suggest that interest rates will remain low rather than high. Both cases – the higher- and lower-rate ones – have their share of compelling arguments, and surely both contain elements of truth. I lean on the side of lower rates, but investors should consider both cases and come to their own conclusions.Those who come out on the side of the lower-rates thesis should find an increased portfolio allocation to U.S. Treasuries and related fixed income securities to be relatively attractive.

Phillips 66 Benefiting From Historically High Distillate Yields,"While Phillips 66 () has been heavily investing in its Midstream and Chemicals segments in order to diversify the company from the cyclical refining business, in the near term the company's Refining segment continues to be the dominant factor whenAs most of you know, PSX has been executing on a multi-year plan to diversify away from refining by heavily investing in its chemicals and midstream segments. If you follow me, you know that I have not been impressed by the company's massive investments in newThe much better news is that PSX, in June,  the purchase of all DCP Midstream's LP units that it did not already own. As a result, the upcoming Q3 report will be the first full-quarter that will include all of DCP's LP results. Note that Enbridge () still owns a 13.2% economic interest in DCP via the General Partnership. As I have opined on Seeking Alpha, it's likely just a matter of time before PSX buys out ENB's remaining economic interests in DCP.Regardless, and with DCP now firmly under the PSX umbrella, the company expects to deliver strong growth in Midstream EBITDA from its integrated wellhead-to-market strategy. Indeed, the Midstream segment is expected to be the biggest single contributor of the $3 billion in expected mid-cycle EBITDA growth from the period 2022-2025. This is shown in the slide below from PSX's :However, and considering the moribund Chemicals Segment, near-term performance will likely continue to be dominated by the performance of the company's Refining Segment, which has been a laggard for years when compared to its primary competitors Valero () and Marathon Petroleum (). This under-performance is clearly shown in the relative five-year total returns performance of the three companies:Yet there is some good news in PSX's Refining Segment. The company has finally started to make some significant headway in improving its Refining Segment's market capture and expects to achieve an incremental increase of $400 million annually via refining margin expansion.Meantime, PSX - which is the largest importer of Canadian Oil Sands WCS crude - is benefiting from its higher distillate yield as diesel margins remain strong as we head into the winter heating season (see graphic below). This is good news for PSX shareholders because, as you know, distillate demand is seasonal with increased consumption during the winter months.As you can see from the diagram above, while below blow-out 2022 pricing, the 2023 distillate crack spread (green dots) has remained significantly above average and jumped higher toward the end of Q3, with the average August crack spread coming in at $1.10/gallon. That was  than the RBOB gasoline crack spread in August ($0.80/gallon). As a result, PSX continues to optimize its refineries for diesel. Indeed, on the , Brian Mandell - head of PSX's Marketing & Commercial Operations - reported that PSX's exports were up nearly 50,000 bpd yoy during the quarter:Meantime, the recent increase in Brent/WTI oil prices should mean higher margins for PSX's NGLs fractionation capacity as well as better pricing for PSX's LPG exports.As a result, and according to , consensus earnings estimates for Q3 have risen sharply from $3.82/share 90-days ago to the current estimate of $4.76:For the year, the consensus estimate is for $15.71/share of earnings, which I believe may be on the low side given projections of only $2.97/share in Q4, which I believe is overly pessimistic given current market conditions and the recent increase in WTI. Also, the EPS estimates for next year appear to be on the low side as well given PSX's strategy to reduce costs while increasing efficiencies and refining margin expansion. However, PSX has been talking about increasing refining margin capture for many years, and it could be that the market is simply in ""show me"" mode.Regardless, and given PSX's current stock price of $115.91 at pixel time, the $15.71/share EPS estimates equates to a P/E=7.4x and a forward P/E=8.5x. The current $4.20 annual dividend equates to a yield of 3.6%. This valuation level appears reasonable given PSX's past performance, the relatively poor performance expectations of the Chemicals Segment, and the macro geopolitical and economic environment.However, I believe that significant upside potential exists if PSX management can show   improvement in the Refining Segment's market capture. I also think it possible that PSX could benefit from accelerating its integration of DCP integration and realizable cost synergies.As seen in the graphic below of PSX's quarterly dividend growth, prior to the global pandemic, PSX was one of the best dividend growth stocks in the entire S&P 500:Given the current dividend obligation is only $4.20 in comparison to expectations of over $15/share of earnings this year, shareholders can expect a big boost in the dividend. Remember, part of relatively new CEO Mark Lashier's strategy was a commitment to return $10-$12 billion to shareholders - via dividends and share buybacks - during the 10 quarters ending in 2024. So far, the company is ahead of schedule in that it has delivered $5.4 billion to shareholders over the first four quarters of the plan:At the end of Q2, PSX had $3 billion in cash, $19 billion in long-term debt, and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35%. That relatively high ratio is primarily a result of the DCP acquisition. However, the company is on record to reduce that leverage metric by the end of the year. Still, there should be plenty of free cash flow to reward shareholders with a hefty dividend increase.Given PSX earnings outlook, continued strong distillate margins, multiple cost and operational efficiency initiatives, and its relatively low P/E ratio, I'm tempted to upgrade PSX from Hold to Buy. However, I have been frequently disappointed by the performance of PSX's Refining Segment in the past, and have decided to curb my enthusiasm and reaffirm my Hold rating. However, I do believe that upside risks are greater than downside risks and, regardless of the second half earnings reports, I expect a strong boost in the dividend sooner rather than later.I'll end with a long-term total returns comparison of PSX vs. the broad S&P500 as represented by the Vanguard S&500 ETF () since the spin-off of PSX from its mother ship ConocoPhillips () back in 2012:As can be seen in the graphic, PSX was a significantly outperforming stock prior to the pandemic. But, just like , the company was caught with its pants down during the pandemic (mostly due to massive cap-ex over-spending on global petchem projects...) and had to leverage the balance sheet to meet its dividend obligation. I expect PSX will, once again, begin to outperform the S&P 500 going forward. Indeed, it's already starting to do so (see far right hand side of the chart above).

The Higher-Rates Narrative: A Rebuttal,"Ten-year Treasury yields have increased dramatically over the last few months, rising from a low of 3.4% in May of 2023 to a whopping 4.5% by the end of September. Alongside this run-up in rates has been the emergence of aInvestors thinking about how to allocate their assets between equities and U.S. Treasuries, or fixed income securities more broadly, have to understand the higher-rates narrative, and then decide if they believe it. Those who subscribe to the narrative may not find Treasuries attractive, because rates could continue to increase, thus driving down bond prices. Those investors who believe the opposing narrative -- thatWith this dilemma facing investors in mind, I go through the hedge fund higher-rates narrative and argue that, while the hedge fund camp’s arguments are certainly compelling, there is a more compelling set of counterarguments for why rates are currently too high.To better understand the issues involved, let's now dive into Ackman's higher-rates thesis.Ackman starts out his piece with the following (I rearrange the order of some of the statements from the tweet to maintain a better discussion flow):The peace dividend is hardly gone. Though there are many tragic counterexamples, the global trend towards  that started in the wake of the Second World War is still in place to all of our benefit. It is true that outsourcing to China is being reduced – to a large extent because  – but global trade and outsourcing , with some countries like Mexico and Vietnam benefiting from the pivot away from China. While there is evidence that these trends are leading to wage pressures in the U.S., this is more of a slow transition away from China than an abrupt shift towards deglobalization. Furthermore, the current UAW strike targeting Detroit’s big three is driven largely by the union’s attempt to  given to the auto manufacturers during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), rather than an inflation-triggered demand for higher wages. Given the concession catalyst for the UAW strike, it is far from clear whether workers in other industries will follow suit or whether they have enough leverage to do so.Energy prices rise and fall with regularity. Looking at the last 20 years of WTI prices shows no evidence of a trend towards higher real oil prices, though there are many fluctuations over that time. It is a market heavily influenced by OPEC, and it is hard to imagine that OPEC will not face pressure to increase production should oil prices go substantially above $100 per barrel. In addition, U.S. shale becomes very profitable at these , which naturally brings supply back into the market. The SPR has, indeed, been , and this will lead to price-supportive demand in the oil market. But the logical conclusion of the sentence that “Energy prices are rising rapidly” is that this rise will at some point be arrested by market and geopolitical forces.Ackman then points to the green energy transition, which will certainly be expensive, as a force that will lead to increasing inflation expectations.While inflationary expectations may rise in the future for a host of reasons, they are currently under control and inflation expectations have not contributed to the recent increase in rates. The current rise in rates is entirely driven by an increase in real rates, as inflation breakevens have stayed largely unchanged, presumably because the market believes the Fed will succeed in its inflation fight.Consumer inflation expectation surveys also point to moderating inflation.The evidence for rising inflationary expectations is not there. Inflation expectations – market- and survey-based – are falling.Our national debt is rising, as is public debt globally. According to an , the U.S. is not a particular outlier among advanced economies. There has been a secular increase in public debt to GDP globally for the last 60 years, a time of secularly declining interest rates. This suggests there is no mechanical relationship between national debt to GDP and the level of rates. (In fact, debt levels have been , likely a reflection of a more stable and robust financial system which can produce and monitor higher amounts of debt.) As is widely known, Japan has much higher debt to GDP than the U.S., and has substantially lower interest rates and ongoing struggles with deflation.An important point is that there is nothing magical about the 100% debt-to-GDP level. Debt is a stock and GDP is a flow, and a better comparison might be between the U.S. debt level and present value of all future GDP, which would make our debt level look miniscule by comparison.This is not to say that fiscal discipline does not matter. It does. Furthermore, I concede the point that persistent government threats to default on national debt are very detrimental to investor confidence, especially in the long-run. As I’ve  in the past, our government would do well to put in place a system where these political hijinks don’t allow for the U.S. to default on our debt obligations.The post then turns to the topic of the high U.S. debt load:There is a large literature in macroeconomics documenting the dollar’s unique role as a global reserve currency. China’s selling of U.S. debt – which is likely being done to  rather than as a loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar – is unlikely to . In fact, the U.S. dollar has appreciated alongside the increase in 10-year Treasury rates, suggesting that dollar outflows are not causing the rate increases.This is true, but as the next chart illustrates real GDP growth and 10-year Treasury yields have not had a particularly tight relationship historically, though they began to comove more after the Global Financial Crisis. Typically, real growth has run at a lower level than 10-year rates, though since the GFC, this has not been true. Part of the reason is that, after the Global Financial Crisis, Treasury yields fell to reflect increased investor demand for Treasuries as disaster-risk hedges. The currently higher level of 10-year rates relative to lagged GDP growth is anomalous in the post-GFC era.Another take on whether positive economic sentiment is responsible for the rates increase compares the San Francisco Fed’s  (extracted from the economic coverage of 24 major U.S. newspapers) to the level of 10-year Treasury yields. While both news sentiment and rates have increased from their 2020 COVID lows, the current increase in rates far outpaces the rise in economic sentiment from major U.S. newspapers, which calls into question the causal impact of beliefs about future economic growth on the increase in interest rates.U.S. PCE inflation (the Fed’s ) has hovered around the 2% level in the 1950s and early 1960s, with a noted increase in the 1970s, following that decade’s oil price shocks, that lasted until the 1990s, after which PCE inflation dropped back to the 2% level. 2% is an admittedly arbitrary level, but so is any other one. And the Fed and ECB have both decided 2% is the right number. Given that inflation is about expectations, and that the two largest global central banks have decided 2% is the right level for these expectations, it is hard to imagine why any other arbitrary number would be less arbitrary than 2%. Furthermore, while the world is surely very different now, many of the differences – like technological progress and increased efficiencies – are deflationary (look at the inflation experience of Japan and now ).No doubt heavy issuance is a concern for fixed income managers. At some point, if issuance becomes sufficiently heavy, the yield demanded by investors to buy the new debt will be so high that companies will find it uneconomic to raise capital. The fact that issuance is heavy means that there are buyers out there who are willing to buy bonds at interest rate levels that companies are willing to pay. This is market clearing. If the above-mentioned manager stepped away, and others did the same, issuance levels would immediately drop. That this isn’t happening means that, as some managers step away, others step in to absorb the issuance, believing that the rates being offered are sufficiently attractive.Technicals are a fickle friend. If many hedge funds subscribe to the higher-rates thesis and have expressed these views through derivatives and levered short bets – as seems likely – then the technicals supporting rate rises can easily turn and a short squeeze can quickly push rates back down.There were many compelling arguments made over the prior decade about why rates may now be in a permanently lower state (for example, this  talks about the impact of demographics on the level of rates). Giving markets a bit of credit, after many years of low rates with the associated narratives for why they are so low, it is not surprising, and perhaps also not wrong, that investors felt that buying Treasuries at 4% yields was attractive. Many still , and time will tell whether or not they will be proven wrong.According to , nominal rates contain several components: a term reflecting economic growth (higher growth, higher rates), a term reflecting the use of Treasuries to provide tail risk hedges (more hedging demand, lower rates), a term premium which justifies why 10-year rates are on average higher than shorter-dated rates, an inflation expectation term (higher inflation, higher nominal rates), and an inflation risk premium (more concern about inflation, higher nominal rates). Depending on one’s assumptions, this decomposition can lead to a range of possible rate outcomes, and it is not clear why 5.5% if the unique outcome of this exercise.Furthermore, it is not obvious that the world is “increasingly risky.” Relative to the vast majority of distant and recent human history, the human condition is now . There are surely many problems – war in Ukraine, China-Taiwan dispute, climate change, disease, to mention a few – but the list of dimensions across which the human condition is better is innumerably long. One could more reasonably argue that the world is getting progressively safer, not riskier.Globally, interest rates have been steadily declining since the 1970s. Beliefs that were formed in prior years have surely been revised downward over time.I would not so readily dismiss AI as a transformative force in the coming years. But don't just take my word for it. Take a look at this  from McKinsey or this  from the Brookings Institution to see what the experts are saying about an impending AI-powered productivity boom.The case for higher rates can be made across multiple dimensions:However, across all these dimensions, there are compelling counterarguments that suggest that interest rates will remain low rather than high. Both cases – the higher- and lower-rate ones – have their share of compelling arguments, and surely both contain elements of truth. I lean on the side of lower rates, but investors should consider both cases and come to their own conclusions.Those who come out on the side of the lower-rates thesis should find an increased portfolio allocation to U.S. Treasuries and related fixed income securities to be relatively attractive.

"USOI: Covered Call Oil Fund, 24% Yield","As per its prospectus, ""The ETNs are senior unsecured obligations of Credit Suisse AG, maturing April 24, 2037"". USOI isYou will notice that outside the top-5 ETNs, the fund assets amounts are very small. For example, the In the covered call funds world most names tend to systematically underperform their reference index. Take for example equities:The Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF () has spent the last year below the total return levels provided by the index itself. That translates into investors being better off buying the S&P 500 index outright versus XYLD.The story is different for oil and USOI:Covered call strategies are dependent on the implied volatility levels present in their respective markets. Writing calls is only profitable from a risk/reward perspective (i.e. giving up a part of the upside) when implied volatility is high, and hence the option premium received is consistent. In the equity space, the VIX has plummeted to levels below 15 and represents a very unappealing place to short volatility. In the oil space, however, volatility is markedly higher:Although volatility as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index has come down substantially in the past year, it is still above 30. This translates into option premiums received for writing calls being rich from a risk/reward perspective. As a personal rule of thumb for writing calls, we would never do it for volatility levels below 25. It just does not pay.The Seeking Alpha platform indicates a 24% dividend yield for USOI:However, do note that from a pure price perspective, the ETN is mostly flat on the year. The fund basically distributes the option premiums it makes on the written call portion, premiums which can vary depending on the level of implied volatility and interest rates in the market:You can see from the above historical table of paid dividends the close correlation with the oil implied volatility. At the beginning of the year, when implied volatility levels were high, the fund paid very consistent monthly dividends. The figures have come down as volatility has subsided.The 24% figure the platform quotes is the trailing twelve-month one (please note TTM in the parenthesis), which is obtained by adding the dividends for the past twelve months and dividing by the current fund price. If volatility stays at current levels, the dividend yield figure is going to come down.The fund is designed to follow a CS covered call oil index:As per its definition, the Index engages in the following:In the definition above, the 'Reference Oil Shares' are shares of the In essence, USOI sells monthly covered calls on USO that have a 6% upside only. The ETN gives up any monthly moves in USO above 6%. A slow, steady increase in the price of oil is beneficial for USOI, while violent moves (both on the upside and downside) lead to worse-off results.As a reminder, USO holds WTI futures, staggered across a number of maturity tenors, in order to create a total return profile as closely correlated with spot WTI as possible.The moves in USO this year have been ideal for USOI. Oil has moved steadily, both on the downside and upside, thus creating an ideal environment for USOI's covered call strategy to harvest volatility-induced premiums. Please note from the above graphs that mid-year when USO had -10% drawdown, USOI did not breach a negative total return figure due to its call option premiums.As we have described in a number of  as of late, we are bullish oil into the year end, feeling that it is well supported on the supply side by OPEC. A range-bound or bullish oil outlook is positive for USOI, setting it up to continue to outperform a pure oil fund like USO, which experiences decay if oil prices stay put.We do not think we are going to have a recession this year, and while going through a minor correction currently, oil will continue to perform into December. USOI is the best instrument outside pure equities to take advantage of that view.USOI is an exchange traded note from Credit Suisse (now UBS). The fund provides for both the embedded return of an oil-covered call strategy and the default risk associated with the issuing entity.The ETN provides for a monthly 6% out-of-the-money covered call writing strategy on the USO WTI oil fund. USOI has done extremely well this year, consistently outperforming USO and being up over 23%. The fund disburses all the option premiums it makes, hence while its price is fairly unchanged for the year, its dividend yield is extremely high.Given the high level of implied volatility in the oil space, we expect USOI to outperform USO into year-end, with the ETN being a much better choice to express a range bound or bullish view on oil. We are therefore a Buy for the name for the remainder of 2023, taking advantage of the current shallow correction in oil prices.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Exxon Mobil: It Is Only Another Billion,"There has long been an argument that  () is large enough that ""a billion here and a billion there"" is not significant. So many just did not  of theNow admittedly, one cannot tell whether each discovery that is commercial will need an FPSO or whether they will need to combine a few discoveries to justify an FPSO. has probably a ""line of sight"" to spend at least $100 billion of partnership money as shown above. The fact that they are going for still more expenditures demonstrates the optimism of the future production of what is quickly turning into the largest basin find in modern times.While it can be argued that current progress is too slow to be meaningful to a company like Exxon Mobil, I would argue that anyone putting the kind of money down now and lining up the commitment shown above, is going to sooner, rather than later, have a material addition to current production.Management already has four FPSOs approved as shown above and the partnership has a reasonable way to get to 6 more FPSOs. Clearly, if the company has plans for the partnership to continue to explore, then the likelihood of still more FPSOs in the ""certain"" future is going to be climbing.Investors need to remember that the partnership retains something like 5 million acres after the ""giveback"" to Guyana.  has been delayed one year, it will still happen. This is still a whole lot more acreage than many basins make available for bids at any given time. What you are likely seeing is the operator trying to convert as many acres as possible to producing and therefore not subject to future givebacks. But that is a pretty standard race against time that I have reported on many times over the years.The other thing to consider here is that Exxon Mobil is getting a lot of attention for just one of the blocks held in Guyana and really no attention at all for any holdings in Suriname. Yet all of this provides still more upside potential if a commercial discovery is determined to justify producing.One of the things that Hess Corporation  management has mentioned several times is how Exxon Mobil manages an FPSO through the approval process while another FPSO is in the development or building phase, and still another one in the hookup and initial production phase. With all the holdings in the area, that scenario could eventually multiply several times over depending upon which partnership and lease holdings have commercial discoveries.Point Thompson is one of  that is producing liquids up in Alaska. This project is also one of the largest natural gas fields in North America. There has been talk about finding ways to export this gas to markets to take advantage of what is anticipated to be a strong natural gas market. However, so far anything solid has not yet really emerged. Still, with liquids production already in place, it would be probably economically attractive to at some point produce the gas for use elsewhere. This would likely be a long-term speculative upside potential project at this time.Production growth has been rather robust for a company of this size. There were some one-time items that hid the progress. But sooner or later the growth will show through. is already heading towards 10%. Now taking into account the one-time items volume was actually below the previous quarter (sequentially speaking). Even though volume was down sequentially, the volume reported was still very strong compared to the year before. Management has still more projects that will accelerate the growth rate besides Guyana.There is a robust production growth guidance for the Permian operations and additional refining capacity was built to handle that volume. The company earnings will not only benefit from the additional production but also should benefit from the refining upgrade to more valuable products.This pattern points to a likely future scenario for Guyana. Right now, the Guyana partnership produces oil. But there certainly would be a market for refined products should the company follow its usual pattern of adding the capability to produce value added products from the production.This is just a summary of the major 2023 projects that will begin to add to cash flow in the near future.The  are the result of billions in expenditures over a multi-year budget. But they are all scheduled to start up and contribute to cash flow either this fiscal year or not long after this fiscal year.Since , Exxon Mobil announced the acquisition of Denbury Inc. (). This acquisition will add yet another major project to the group shown above.Management has more of these projects underway and still more in the planning stage. Some like Point Thompson are more likely in the talking or wishing stage.But the key is that this company is now on a growth trajectory. For a long-time, this company ""tread water"" and the stock price largely reflected that. Now, clearly that is changing to a growth trajectory.That means that future dividend increases are likely to be larger than what has happened in the past. It takes time to transition to a new growth strategy (and money). So, dividend increases are currently lagging behind the profitability progress. But in the long run, dividend increases will catch up the pace of corporate growth.The result of all of this is that Exxon Mobil is slowly turning into a growth and income play. For the last decade or so, it was primarily an income play with growth as an afterthought. As the growth part increases in importance, the company is likely to receive a higher valuation in the market long-term to recognize that growth.Even without that consideration, the oil and gas industry is historically cheap and relatively out-of-favor. Just returning to some normal valuations should result in some decent appreciation pretty much across the board. Any premium growth projects would add to that. As a result, Exxon Mobil remains a strong buy consideration for those looking for a growth and income vehicle.The oil and gas industry has cycles. But this company is safe enough to hold through those cycles. That appeals to a lot of risk averse investors.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience. He has been focusing on this industry for years. He is a retired CPA, and holds an MBA and MA.

BP: Significantly Undervalued At Current Oil Prices,"BP () is a well-known major oil player from the UK which has faced challenging conditions in a difficult oil market for the last three years. Despite drastic events (Deepwater Horizon, shale oil expansion, COVID, Rosneft write-off), the company remained aAt the end of the second quarter 2023, BP had 17.38 bn shares outstanding and a total market cap of $112.8 bn as of 09/30/23 (share price of $6.49).The fundamental ratios can be found in the table below, with a peer comparison*:*sales, EBITDA, earnings, equity and dividend numbers for 2023 in relation to the share prices as of 09/30/23.BP claims the top spot in two fundamental categories (P/S and P/EBITDA), has the second-highest dividend yield and ranks second and third in the other two categories (P/B and P/E). If we compare the 5 oil majors by implementing a score system (1.=4, 2.=3, 3.=2, 4.=1, 5.=0), BP will take the lead.BP has introduced a dividend policy which regularly increases the annual distribution by 4% at $60 per barrel Brent oil after cutting the payout in half in the second quarter of 2020 (from 10.5 cents/quarter to 5.25 cents/quarter) when the pandemic hit the economy. Since then BP has raised the quarterly dividend to 7.27 cents (+38.5% or 11.5% p.a.) which exceeds the policy increase of 4%. At current oil prices above $80 per barrel, it is very likely that BP can increase the payout by 10% annually at least.Furthermore, BP is strongly committed to share buybacks of at least . In 2023 BP allocates 60% of surplus cashflow due to high oil prices. Since the end of 2019, BP has already reduced share count by 14.1% (from 20.241 bn to 17.379 bn shares). In the second quarter of 2023 BP bought back 323 million shares for around $2 bn. At $60 per barrel BP aims to buy shares for $4 bn but due to a good environment for oil companies, BP has At a current share price of $6,45 and if oil prices remain above $80, BP will buy back nearly 1 billion shares each year which represents a buyback yield of more than 5%. Hence, the dividend and buyback yield combined is close to 10%.BP's earnings have been volatile for years because of major shocks which have been mentioned before (COVID, Rosneft). However, earnings have always recovered strongly when the environment for oil prices were beneficial. What is the current outlook for oil prices and the most likely scenario?The most important influences on oil prices are supply and demand (1), economic growth (2) and OPEC policy (3).Oil prices have recently risen to $91 (WTI) and $95 (Brent) per barrel, an increase of 33% since June. Global oil demand is expected to rise to while supply plunged to 100.9 mb/d in July. In July and August oil demand hit a record of 103 mb/d widening the supply gap. Although the supply situation will improve to 101.5 mb/d by an increased non-OPEC+ oil production, oil demand will exceed oil supply for the next months which will support current oil price levels.The global economic output will . Growth is driven by India, China and other emerging markets while Europe's economy will be outpaced. Economic growth will stabilize oil prices as well as global air traffic which . The global demand for travel is continuously high and consequently, it is likely that global air traffic will surpass pre-pandemic levels which will also boost global oil demand.OPEC+ supply fell to 50.2 mb/d in July because of a reduced production of Saudi Arabia. The OPEC+ countries are interested in a tight market and won't add a significant amount of supply to the global oil production. The group announced a total of 3.7 mb/d output cut in April and a revision of this decision is unlikely. OPEC+ produces nearly 50% and OPEC 33% of global oil supply. The output cut will limit a production expansion and oil supply won't keep up with economic growth and demand. Hence, the OPEC policy supports high oil prices in the near future.All in all, a scenario with high oil prices above $80 is very likely (60%) and has consequences for BP's valuation.The first scenario with the highest probability shows a significant undervaluation of BP. Even if we reduce the buyback amount of $6 bn by $700-800 million share based compensation, the buyback yield in combination with future dividend increases support an upside potential of more than 50%. Furthermore, the downside risks are limited as the worst scenario for oil majors still signals an undervaluation for BP. The higher oil prices climb, the more likely and faster BP can surpass pre-pandemic dividend levels.BP is not only undervalued compared to its peers, the company's shares still would have upside potential if oil prices fell which is not very likely near-term. A combination of economic growth, limited oil supply growth and an increasing demand for air travel are excellent conditions for BP shareholders. In the scenario of high oil prices above $80 per barrel, they can expect increasing dividends and a buyback yield of at least 5%. Finally, the shares have a significant upside potential of 55%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Marathon Petroleum Q2 Earnings: Why This Stock Is An Attractive Investment," is one of the refinery stocks that has been on my radar for many years and the biggest peer of my own refinery investment, Valero Energy ().The company just reported its Furthermore, the company is expanding its business as it captures opportunities related to renewable fuel and its superior network of assets.In this article, we'll discuss all of this and assess the risk/reward after the stock's 50% rally off its 52-week lows.So, let's get to it!Marathon's second quarter was a success. The  $36.8 billion in revenue, which was $2.94 billionThat said, sales were down 32.1% year-on-year, which might seem like a stunning number - it is. However, it's caused by last year's unusual developments. The war in Ukraine and refinery shortages caused gasoline prices to explode, leaving companies like MPC with favorable margins.Now, the environment is still strong, but not as strong as it was in 2022, which is a good thing for the economy.Having said that, in the Refining & Marketing segment, refining utilization increased by 4% to 93%, despite significant turnaround activity.An incident at one of the refineries' catalytic reformers in Galveston Bay reduced crude throughput by approximately 2.5 million barrels and its capture by about 1%.Please note that margin capture refers to the actual realized margin compared to a market-based benchmark margin.Sequentially, per barrel margins, were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions due to lower crack spreads and sour crude differentials.Refining operating costs decreased to $5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, primarily due to higher throughput and lower energy costs.As the overview above shows, the refining and marketing margin capture for the quarter was 97%, with the company's commercial team performing well despite planned and unplanned refinery downtime.The company expects fluctuating capture results based on market dynamics but believes its capabilities will provide a sustainable advantage.I have to agree with that, as fundamentals remain favorable.For example, at the end of July, Bloomberg  that gasoline prices are having a strong revival, causing refinery margins to jump.According to Bloomberg (emphasis added):This is the chart Bloomberg used:When zooming out - using my chart - we see two things.Furthermore, Marathon Petroleum has a Midstream segment, which is its majority ownership of midstream giant MPLX LP ().This Midstream segment delivered strong second-quarter results, with adjusted EBITDA remaining flat sequentially but 5% higher year-over-year.The business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows, with high-return growth projects progressing in the Marcellus and Permian basins.As a result of these tailwinds, MPC returned nearly $3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, representing a 100% payout of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.The company had approximately $6.3 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization and held roughly $11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter.After all, one of the key reasons why the company is so aggressive when it comes to buybacks and dividends is its healthy . Not only did the company have roughly $11.5 billion in cash ($10.7 billion excluding MPLX), but its gross debt-to-capital ratio is just 21%. Even including MPLX's $20.4 billion in debt, that number is below 50%.It also has no maturities in 2023.Since May 2021, MPC has repurchased 264 million shares, accounting for approximately 40% of the shares outstanding.The current dividend yield is 2.3%, which enjoys a payout ratio of just 9% and 10.5% average annual dividend growth over the past five years.Like Valero, Marathon Petroleum did not cut its dividend during the pandemic but used its balance sheet to take on more debt. Luckily, the years after the pandemic allowed the company to quickly reduce debt again.Having said all of this, the company is upbeat as it looks into the future.For the third quarter of 2023, MPC expects crude throughput volumes of approximately 2.7 million barrels per day, which would translate to a utilization rate of 94%.The utilization rate is expected to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, incentivizing high refining utilization.The company's guidance also assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter.Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter is expected to be $5.10, benefiting from higher throughput and lower costs due to completed turnaround and project activities.Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, and corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, reflecting sustained reductions.Additionally, the company is investing in growth.For example, MPC completed the STAR project at its Galveston Bay refinery, which enhanced the competitive position of the refinery. The project increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing capacity and improved distillate recovery.MPC boasts two premier 600,000 barrel-per-day refineries on the US Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity, supporting its global commercial strategy.Additionally, construction activities at the Martinez renewable fuels facility are ongoing, with pretreatment capabilities set to come online in the second half of 2023.This facility is expected to reach its full capacity of producing 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.According to MPC, the Martinez facility will become one of the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a strong operating profile, logistics flexibility, and advantaged feedstock slate, supported by a strategic relationship with Finish refinery giant Neste.With that said, let's look into the valuation.When looking at the analysts' free cash flow estimates, we see a steep downtrend. However, it's not as bad as it looks. Essentially, what we're seeing is an expected long-term normalization in margins. 2022 was truly exceptional. Unless a miracle happens, we will continue to see normalization.However, bear in mind that in 2019, the company generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. Even the expected result of $4.1 billion in 2025 would be far above that.Having said that, I do not believe that the decline will be this steep. Analysts continue to underestimate the earnings power of this company and its peers, which was confirmed by 2Q23 numbers.Nonetheless, sticking to analyst numbers and using 2024 estimates, the company is trading at 9.1x 2024E free cash flow.Not only does an 11.0% free cash flow imply a lot of room to maintain aggressive dividend growth and buybacks it also indicates a favorable valuation.Given the health of MPC's business and ability to capture long-term growth, I would make the case that the company should not trade below 12x free cash flow.This would indicate a fair price 32% above the current price.The current consensus price target is $144, which is 7% above the current price.Based on this context, I still do not urge anyone to jump into MPC. The economy is not in a good spot, and given the recent uptrend in the market and MPC, I would only buy this company after a 10-15% correction.My rating is bullish to reflect the fact that my longer-term target is well above the current stock price.In conclusion, Marathon Petroleum has shown impressive resilience and earnings power, despite economic weakness.The company's recent quarterly earnings report revealed strong refinery demand, setting the stage for aggressive buybacks and consistent dividend growth.With MPC's expansion into renewable fuels and its superior network of assets, the company is well-positioned for future growth. Despite a dip in sales compared to the exceptional numbers of the previous year, the company remains in a favorable spot.Furthermore, MPC's Midstream segment, through its ownership of MPLX, continues to generate strong cash flows and offers high-return growth opportunities.The company's healthy balance sheet allows for aggressive buybacks and dividends, making it a sound long-term investment with an attractive valuation.Overall, I rate MPC as bullish for the long term, considering its ability to weather market fluctuations and deliver sustained growth.However, given the prevailing economic conditions, it may be prudent to wait for a 10-15% correction before considering an entry into this promising refinery stock.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

APA Corporation: Playing The Block-58 Waiting Game,"Shares of  () have rallied since our  in January of 2022, where I called a buy at $30.00. This was on the strength of the 4th successful well test inA  has led to a multi-year delay in achieving FID, and helped to put a drag on the stock. Low gas prices have also contributed to the stock being range bound in the mid-$30's to low $40's, as the company's other signature asset,  is a dry gas producer primarily.Recently trading in theLet's take a quick look at the near term fundamentals for APA and see if we are at a decent entry point for future growth. We will also discuss the impact of the newly released agreement to do a  on the project's feasibility.APA has a well distributed footprint globally with operations in the U.S., UK, Eygpt, and Suriname. At present the U.S. provides the bulk of its revenue through the Alpine High gas asset in the Permian basin and an  in the Delaware to temper low gas prices, followed closely by Egypt. Lastly comes the UK, where in new drilling, presumably due to the  regime.U.S. Production is at 212,796 BOEPD, with 36% oil, 29% NGL's, and 30% gas. Activity was strong in the Midland basin with 10 new oil wells TIL'd, and in the Delaware with 11 new wells TIL'd in Q-2. Alpine High activity is suspended due to low gas and gas liquids prices.Egypt produced 144K BOEPD of 61% oil, no NGL's and 39% gas. Production is forecast to grow to 148K BOEPD in Q-3.In the U.K APA produced 42,118K BOEPD of 83% oil, 2% NGL's, and 15% gas. Q-3 is expected to increase output to 47K BOEPD thanks to a restoration of curtailment, and new well contribution from Storr North. APA has a number of exploration prospects advantaged by the massive amount of infrastructure in the North Sea, but do not compete for capital under the present oppressive tax regime.That brings us to Suriname, and rates its own section.Apache and partner, TotalEnergies () have had a string of successes since forming the JV in late 2019. With the success of the test on Krabdagu#3, a petroleum system has been established that runs from Maka#1 to K-3, as the second bullet notes. With the recent discovery in Block-53, additional reserves may be lumped in, further complicating the decision not to go forward - I think we are there, but rather...how to go forward. That's the key, and I will next discuss why (I think) this is taking so long. Matt Andre, Platts Analytics manager for energy analysis–production, was quoted in a as saying-The company's language is instructive if you know what to read in between the lines. ""Technical Analysis,"" mentioned in the first bullet suggests to me that before taking the final FID, the JV wants to understand the reservoir better, as the key for development is a low production cost. Patrick Pouyane, CEO of TTE commented in a , in regard to Block 58-Efficiently draining the reservoir is key to hitting Mr. Pouyane's target. The way I see it, the Production Technologists are determining-So you can see there is a lot to do to cross all the t's and dot the i's to total up the costs. Now Total has some experience at doing these projects, and I would expect them to know within a couple of hundred million what the final cost will be. But, it is estimated at $9 bn, and if it's actually going to be $15 bn, this would be a great time to find out.As practical matter, unless something really unusual - war, fear, famine, pestilence,.... the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - show up.... this is a ""done"" deal. You don't have company presidents flying around the world to meet with heads of state and the petroleum ministry of a country to just eat rubber chicken. Unless you are pretty darned sure you've  these meetings don't take place.On revenue of $1.79 bn for the quarter, APA generated 1.24 bn in EBITDA, $1.0 bn in OCF- up ~3X sequentially and down 30% YoY, and $381 mm in Net Income. A sequential drop of 10%, and a YoY of 30% respectively for revenue and EBITDA. Net Income rose sequentially due to some asset sales to $381 mm from $242 mm, but declined YoY from $926 mm, most thanks to lower realizations on produced products.Capex on a run rate basis in running $2.3 bn for the year, but management has reduced capex through the end of the year, with expectations for it coming in at $1.9 bn. Curtailments in Alpine High and no further drilling this year in Suriname account for this reduction.Capital returns to shareholders have totaled $2.9 bn since 2021, and debt now standing at $5.3 bn has been cut by $3.2 bn over the same period.Moody's returned APA debt to investment grade in June.Production guidance is for daily output between 404-408 BOEPD as we exit 2023. On an unadjusted basis this represent about a 10% growth YoY. On an adjusted basis expectations are for ~325k BOEPD, an 8% bump higher from the 304 reported in 2022.Several risks are apparent for APA Corp. The first are oil prices, as noted in the cash flow commentary, current pricing around $90-95 for WTI and Brent will take cash flow back toward $3.5-4.0 bn on a run rate basis. If we sag back there are risks to shareholder returns and the stock price ultimately.It's worth noting the company had to dip into cash reserves to pay out dividends and stock buybacks for the quarter, as cash flow fell short by $29 mm. I think the company made a good decision to fund the share buyback at $38, as I think the company is under priced at those levels.Any change in OPEC+'s posture with production restraint or by our own government with respect toward additional SPR releases would have an adverse effect on share prices.Finally if they don't take FID on Suriname for whatever reason, the shares will struggle to improve from current levels.APA Corp is trading at 3.2X EV/EBITDA at present prices, and $55K per flowing barrel. Neither one of those metrics are excessive in my book, and I would rate the company as a buy for short term gains and modest income.Longer term, as I have taken pains to point out, I think shares of APA are a steal at current prices. You will have to look long and hard to find a company with the revenue and cash flow potential that a successful FID on Block-58 gives to APA.Similarly priced competitor, Murphy Oil () trades at 3.4X EV/EBITDA and $46K per flowing barrel, so slightly better, but doesn't have that potential cash cow of Block-58, Suriname hanging in the window a few years hence. I think APA wins the tip off on that basis.Fluidsdoc is an international oil industry veteran with 40 years of experience having worked on six continents and in over twenty countries around the world.

"VDE: After The Pullback, Energy Is A No-Brainer (Rating Upgrade)","The purpose of this article is to evaluate the Vanguard Energy ETF () as an investment option at its current market price. This is a passively managed sector fund with an objective to ""track theI have long been a proponent of holding the Energy sector (whether via VDE or some other avenue) in my portfolio - and this is something I suggested to my followers multiple times over the years. While I believe in this sector long-term and in most environments, it isn't always a buy. This was true when I last covered this ETF back in . I saw strong gains in rapid succession - and that usually makes me cautious. In hindsight, that caution has been vindicated:As you can see, VDE has seen a pullback, but it is lower by comparison to the broader S&P 500. With this reality, I thought it was timely to consider if VDE offered some value here. Considering both the recent drop and the rise of military conflict in a key oil-producing region of the world, I do believe VDE represents an interesting opportunity. As a result, I am upgrading my rating to ""buy"" for this fund. I will explain the reasons for this decision in detail below.The most important attribute for oil and energy in my mind right now is the current military conflict between Israel and Hamas. As readers know, oil prices spiked in the immediate reaction to this conflict. But, throughout October, prices have moderated. While they remain relatively elevated, they have pulled off their highs noticeably. This poses the question - is the opportunity to profit off high oil prices passed, or is there still room to see them go higher from here?The answer, of course, is speculative at this point and I would encourage all my followers to consider their own outlook. But one point would be hard to debate: that the ultimate impact of this war on oil prices, while uncertain, will almost certainly rise if there is an expansion or escalation in this conflict.That could take multiple forms. Whether it means more nations get involved - such as the US or Iran, if Israel expands its ground operations in to additional territories, or if oil producers weaponize their oil production to get concessions from the US and the West to stay out of the conflict. All of these outcomes have a very realistic chance of sending oil prices soaring. If so, that would provide a major boost to energy companies that comprise VDE.Of course, the opposite take should be considered as this poses a risk to investors in this ETF. If the conflict were to resolve quickly (which I do not anticipate) and/or it remains isolated between Israel and Hamas, then the potential for soaring energy prices are probably not going to materialize. The impact will be moderate, as it has been in the past week or so.If that is the resolution here, then the continued rise in oil prices - and their sustainability - are not going to be reminiscent of the 1970's - 1980's:My conclusion here is that investors need to be aware of the heightened risks the current geopolitical environment poses. I see it as an opportunity personally, hence my bullish outlook. But the potential for disproportionate losses is present as well, and I would urge my followers to consider these carefully before buying in too deeply if they choose to do so.This is another key driver that is supportive of higher oil prices, and it gets more excited than geopolitical risks. That is because those events can often be fleeting and volatile, resulting in temporary profits but longer term uncertainty. By contrast, structural changes in the Energy sector that deliver long-term benefits are truly what investors should want to see.So, what are some of these structural changes? One is that the rig count in the US - a major oil/energy producer - has been declining recently. In fact, the total U.S. rig count is down over 20% from the peak in December last year. This has coincided with a rise in WTI crude prices, which tend to be inversely correlated over time, as shown below:This has been driven by a number of factors. One, in this political environment here in the US, some producers are reluctant to invest much in more production facilities because of uncertainty. This uncertainty - regarding government support and/or new regulations - makes companies hesitant to commit to longer term investments because they do not know if they will pay off down the road. Further, in a structural shift, larger drillers that have bought out smaller firms are beginning to retire the legacy rigs, rather than using them to continue or expand operations.The net result is fewer rigs and the potential for tighter US supply in the years ahead. This is a fundamental shift in policy from the production majors in this sector who used to focus more on volume. Now they are more disciplined and focused on keeping prices sustainably higher to drive more consistent returns. From a consumer perspective, this poses a challenge. But as an investor, this opens up an opportunity to be long this sector for the foreseeable future. This alone helps to support the ""buy"" rating on funds such as VDE.Expanding on the above discussion, it isn't just the US rig count that is concerning for the global oil demand-supply imbalance. As readers are surely aware, the US is just one piece of the puzzle. OPEC+ plays a major role, as do other countries on the demand side, notably China and India. So while US production has actually remained high (despite the movement on domestic rigs), OPEC+ (primarily Saudi Arabia) and Russia have been voluntarily extending supply cuts that were initially expected to be temporary.The net result is that global demand is anticipated to outpace supply for the rest of 2023, with my prediction this will continue in to early 2024 too:This is central to why I like buying Energy - and VDE by extension - on any sector pullback (such as right now). The marketplace simply does not have enough energy inputs to meet demand, so prices are going to have to rise. This plays right into the hands of the companies in VDE's portfolio.The next topic for discussion is an unfortunate one. This has to do with the situation the US government finds itself in with respect to keeping energy prices low for US consumers. While the releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) last year were marginally effective, the US doesn't really have this option in its arsenal anymore.While just one option out of many, this is an important one because it would often make headlines and cause (somewhat fleeting) a moderation in end-user prices (think at the gas pump). However, the SPR has not been replenished after being drawn down last year. Aside from putting the country in a more precarious position, it limits any opportunity to moderate the crude oil market with additional releases in Q4 and next year:What I am driving at here is that the market is going to be left to its own devices in the short-term. The OPEC+ conglomerate is committed to keeping prices high and the US government has very few options to fight higher domestic prices at the moment. The SPR is at levels that are precarious, so further releases will be limited in their impact and will be irresponsible right now, in my opinion. All of this adds up to a favorable backdrop for VDE.My last topic of discussion is to remind readers that VDE remains very top-heavy. This is not inherently ""bad"", but it is an important consideration because it means that, despite owning 100 companies, investors are very beholden to the fortunes of a handful of names:Similar to the opening paragraph, this has potential for both rewards and losses. We don't have to look much further back than this past Friday (10/27) when Chevron ()  Q3 earnings. The market wasn't thrilled with the results, and the stock paid the price:This pressured VDE of course and should be a reminder about the risks facing investors when picking up this fund. If any of the majors in this fund see a bad drop, that is undoubtedly going to result in losses for the fund overall.VDE has seen weakness in the near term, but I view that positively as a buying opportunity. Current geo-political risks, continued tight supply, and a favorable backdrop expected in 2024 for the Energy sector all convince me that a bullish review here is the right one. As a result, I am upgrading my rating on this fund to ""buy"", and I would urge my followers to give the idea some thought going forward.Consider the Income LabI began my career in financial services in 2008, at the height of the market crash.

The sector weakness has also affectedHowever, I assessed buyers have returned over the past four weeks, attempting to fend off a further slide, which could lead to a collapse toward its October 2022 lows at the $45 level. With AB InBev scheduled to report its third-quarter of  on October 31, investors will be keen to see a further market share normalization in its North American business.Management presented in an insightful  in September 2023, as it updated investors about its global organic growth strategies. Accordingly, the companyAs such, I urge investors to pay close attention to its ex-US market momentum, which is critical to justify its valuation. Notwithstanding the furor over its failed marketing campaign involving transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney earlier this year, the North American segment accounts for only about  of its sum-of-the-parts valuation.Therefore, I assessed the company wants to remind investors about the growing importance of its Middle Americas segment ""as a developing market opportunity."" The segment has accounted for ""over 50% of EBITDA and has been a top revenue and profit driver for the company over the past five years.""Analysts' estimates suggest that AB InBev's adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to bottom out in FY23. Accordingly, the company is expected to post a marked improvement in its adjusted EBITDA margin by FY25, reaching 35.1%, up from this year's 33.4% estimates. While it's nowhere close to its pre-COVID margins near the 40% mark, BUD's price action remains nearly 50% below its 2019 highs. In other words, I believe BUD's valuation has likely reflected significant headwinds.Seeking Alpha Quant rates BUD with a ""D+"" valuation grade, suggesting a premium valuation relative to its sector peers. However, the wide-moat brewer boasts a best-in-class ""A+"" profitability grade, underpinned by a solid ""B"" growth grade. The recent controversies haven't impacted the company's robust business model, as it picks up the pieces toward margin recovery.Based on management's commentary on its recent Investor Day, the ex-US opportunities would likely underpin the company's growth drivers over the medium term. Bolstered by a further push toward premiumization trends, it's expected to boost its ability to meet Wall Street's medium-term margin projections.Notwithstanding my optimism, I must highlight that BUD's mean-reversion thesis remains a work in progress. The dominant medium-term trend bias points to the downside. Moreover, the inability of dip buyers to sustain a decisive recovery of the $60 level suggests caution is necessary.In other words, buying sentiments on BUD remain highly uncertain, with the bearish bias reinstating recently after it bottomed out in early June. As such, while the expected bottoming of the XLP could help provide some respite for BUD, I see the risk/reward as less attractive now.As such, while the company is confident of improving its profitability margins, the market doesn't seem convinced. With that in mind, I believe moving back to the sidelines and assessing how the consolidation occurs from here is appropriate.Have constructive commentary to improve our thesis?

U.S. Oil And Gas Echoes Macro And Geopolitical Environment (Video),"The most unfortunate threats to global economies are the volatility and instability wrought by the recent attack on Oct. 7 of Israel. We were already troubled by the Russia invasion of Ukraine. There has subsequently been a re-working of energy trade routes with both oil and natural gas. With the trouble in the Middle East, energy trade relationships could alter courses again.The centers of geopolitical gravity of late have been the Middle East and Russia. Notably, in a recent U.S-EU , a NATO leader spoke of how U.S. LNG hasWith respect to the Middle East, where I have spent much of my bandwidth assessing and the majority of my time from Oct. 4 to now even — of course, oil prices have risen to reflect a risk premium. Just like what happened with Russia last year, markets start to settle once specific events and their direction are more apparent. But we have groups willing to incite scorched earth policies and events. Eventually, this will have repercussions in another form, whether it be domestic political instability or being out of favor with investors as an investment destination.In both cases, alternative sources of gas and oil have been found by market participants. The U.S. is a significant player as a source of global oil and gas supply in Asia, and more so in Europe than previously.Also, in Europe, from a NATO perspective, they continue with sustainable sourcing of energy such as alternative fuels, microgrids, storage — more home-grown solutions. In Montana, on a panel and conversation with a former Governor of Montana, we talked about various forms of storage and energy. Energy storage is becoming an increasingly interesting space in which new ventures and acquisitions will be happening. All of the majors such as Exxon Mobil () and Chevron () are investing to make sure they can play in emerging energy spaces of the future.Given the events of the day, oil and gas markets and the energy transition have changing investment implications. Interest rate increases are a driver in ways we are just starting to see, especially with renewables and EVs. Higher rates shift decision making. This idea was echoed by the CEO of AT&T, who l listened to at the economist conference I attended just before Montana. Regarding “transition” type investments, I would focus more on needs-based investments. The Inflation Reduction Act legislation is a real mixed bag on its incentives, distortions and ultimate effects, and thus capital signals.In the end, oil is fungible and a most-traded commodity. In advanced economies, electrification is becoming potentially more inflationary with all of the factors of green, as witnessed in Europe. Many countries in Europe are rolling back their initial plans to some degree, but not entirely either. Power generation grows in the rest of the world. From a recent Texas-focused energy conference at Texas Tech University on Oct. 20, unique demand centers are emerging in the tech space that can offset the supply-demand mismatches that are occurring. My 2023 theme of  is playing out in a big way in Texas, owing to its decentralized market.The natural gas trade is shifting around the globe, as alluded to in the """" work. The U.S. is a low-cost producer in oil and gas and a reliable partner. We're a global benchmark as I noted in the past, and in my Montana presentation (roughly half way through).Oil prices will remain higher with tight supplies occurring to the year end. U.S. producers are expected to respond, but this is still a capital discipline regime by oil and gas firms. It seems that natural gas prices in the U.S. will stay on the lower side. Importantly, U.S. production is a player on the global stage, with new avenues emerging as geopolitics shift thinking and strategies.In recent, West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, a key U.S. oil price benchmark, is now to be folded into the global benchmark Brent, alongside its other constituents.In the past, I have written extensively about Pioneer, the Permian, and more recently about the Exxon acquisition. The market’s reception is quite significant and positively viewed. Given the events of the last couple of weeks in geopolitics, it's all the more positive that consolidation and scale occur in parts of the industry. In my article from April, where the acquisition idea was floated, much is covered. (First  () () potential tie-up article).With the Chevron-Hess () () announcement, the continuing consolidation in the industry indicates the ideas of scale and efficiency; this was discussed and analyzed more in-depth since the first quarter of 2023.The  () possibly looking to acquire Marathon Oil () speaks to this continued theme.At the National Association of Business Economists conference Oct. 9-10, a few takeaways stand out. One of the sessions I attended focused on the macro environment, with attention to rising long-term yields. This Wall Street Journal article speaks to the idea.Logan didn’t delve deeply into what specifically is driving up term premiums. But on Wall Street, many have  that yields have been rising largely thanks to a growing federal budget deficit.However, being in the room on Oct. 9, my notes say:Pressure is stemming from long-term yields. Where the pressures are coming from determine the direction of interest rates changes, whether up or down. Logan mentioned that half of the long-dated yields is from the term premium.Then the 19, Fed Chairman Powell , echoing what Logan had said:On the global macro side, Logan mentioned slowing global growth in the second and third quarter. China’s structural issues influence this but also near-shoring trends are influencing global trade flows.Additionally, I was struck by a comment in the deindustrialization panel. Bottomline: Different trading relationships are happening. We're still dependent on China trade; it’s just happening differently via proxies such as Vietnam.Also, there's the chance that trading blocs shift toward that of like-minded partners. North America looks good and offers “balance.” Other parts of the world are more difficult to project, especially now with this current crisis and its effect in the Middle East and beyond. In the longer term, the momentum of “markets” will prevail — but we are effectively disrupted.Our U.S. industry is global, capable and efficient. We will continue to utilize technology to produce resources more efficiently and cleanly in the future. I think with Exxon’s purchase of Pioneer, the sheer size of Exxon will allow for new advances in the Permian, and translate elsewhere. The same is true of the Chevron-Hess acquisition.In general, my geopolitical takeaway is: Disengagement is not an option. We can engage with the rest of the world in energy and alongside our capital markets. That is a positive path forward —our technology, innovative minds and markets’ transparency.Secondly, the theme of natural gas being a “transition” fuel is still my main idea in that thought experiment. However, on a practical level, natural gas is a generally reliable and affordable source of baseload power. It has a cleaner emissions profile and more work is being done globally to cleanup methane emissions, a byproduct of its production when not addressed.With regards to Energy Transfer () and an upcoming feature, the eventual start of their Lake Charles LNG plant is a net positive for the U.S., the industry and other countries. There has been support for their stewardship in this capacity from global players such as Shell () and others. (Once the story is online, I will post a link in comments.)In summary, U.S. oil and gas offers a bullish investment theme as noted in the video. Given geopolitics, oil market tightness and the economic outlook, the majors have picked their moment well. In the  shale story, I noted that the majors had l, and now they have returned. In 2023, they have returned again in even more full force. The requisite energy infrastructure has to work, connecting supply to demand centers, as geopolitics and market conditions shift the landscape again. The midstream sector, which includes diversified players like Energy Transfer with their large global footprint, also will be part of the solution.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Countdown To Shutdown,"U.S. equity markets declined for a fourth-straight week while benchmark interest continued an unabating resurgence to fresh multi-decade highs as a potential looming government shutdown, lukewarm economic data, and ongoing labor disputes added complications toPosting its seventh weekly decline in the past nine weeks, the  declined another 0.7% on the week, finishing the quarter near its lowest-levels since early June. However, the other major equity benchmarks achieved modest gains on the week, as the  gained 0.3% while the Positive catalysts have been increasingly sparse in recent weeks, lifting the  (""VIX"") - also known as the Wall Street ""fear gauge"" - to the highest since late May. Oil prices - a key source of much of the recent dismay - continued their ascent today with  hovering around $95/barrel as fresh Department of Energy (DoE) data showed that inventories of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve remained near 40-year low following a historically-large depletion in late 2022. Benchmark yields continued their ascent as well, with the  swelling another 13 basis points to 4.57% - the highest end-of-week close since 2007 - while the  posted an 11th straight week of gains. Complicating the economic outlook, a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown appeared unlikely by Friday's close, while other closely watched negotiations between the UAW and automakers also yielded limited progress. Eight of the eleven GICS equity sectors finished lower on the week, with yield-sensitive sectors, including Utilities () and Consumer Staples () dragging on the downside.The closely-watched PCE Index this week provided further evidence that resurgent oil prices have negated the once-promising disinflationary tailwinds. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 0.39% in August - the highest month-over-month increase since January - which pulled the year-over-year increase to 3.46%, a modest acceleration from July. Consistent with the trends observed in the Consumer Price Index, the Core metrics - which exclude energy and food prices - have remained on a promising trend, which will become even more pronounced in months ahead as the lagging shelter component begins to exert downward pressure on these price indices. The delayed recognition of shelter inflation has heavily distorted the headline and core metrics since 2021, resulting in a significant understatement of inflation from mid-2021-2022 and an overstatement of inflation since mid-2022.Pressured by a resurgence in mortgage rates to fresh twenty-year highs, data this past week showed that housing market activity has cooled once again over the past two months following a modest revival in late Spring and early Summer. New Home Sales fell more than expected in August, dipping 9% from last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 675k. Pending Home Sales, meanwhile, posted a 7% decline from the prior month, slowing to the lowest-levels since 2020. Existing Home Sales data last week showed that sales of previously owned homes dropped to the slowest July pace since 2010, dipping to an annualized rate of 4.04 million, which was 15.3% lower than a year ago. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.31% last week, which is now well above the prior November 2022 highs of 7.08%. Inventory levels have remained near historic lows, however, with just 1.1 million homes for sale at the end of August, which is the lowest since 1999.Limited supply - resulting in part from a ""lock-in effect"" on existing homeowners - has provided a floor for home values in the face of the stiff interest rate headwinds, and has helped to usher in a period of ""normalization"" in home prices after two years of unsustainable increases in 2021 and 2022. This week, the Case Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices were roughly flat year-over-year in July, as prices rose modestly for a sixth straight month following a stretch of seven straight months of declines. The cooldown in home price appreciation is welcome and critically necessary to avoid a speculative bubble that was beginning to build - and the longer-term pain that would result from a period of significantly negative national home price appreciation. National home prices aren't wildly out-of-line with personal income growth over long-term measurement periods. Depending on the measurement period, home prices are between 15% overvalued and 15% undervalued based on historical correlation with personal incomes, the most robust long-term predictor of price trends across time periods and regions.: West Coast-focused  () gained 2% this week following a resolution that ended the five-month Hollywood writer's strike. HPP is among the largest owners of Hollywood studio space - representing roughly 10% of its NOI - the majority of which are operated under usage-based revenue models rather than long-term leases. BTIG upgraded HPP to Buy from Neutral, citing the ending of the strike, along with relatively solid pricing on HPP's recent asset sales and improvement in office utilization rates in several West Coast cities. NYC-focused  () was also among the leaders this week 4% after it announced that One Madison Avenue secured its Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, completing the development three months ahead of schedule. SLG received $577.4M in cash as the final equity payment from its joint venture partners, which SLG used to repay corporate unsecured debt. The 27-story, 1.4 million-square-foot office tower is one of two new ""trophy"" assets in Midtown NYC developed by SLG in the past several years, following the completion of One Vanderbilt in 2020. As noted in our office REIT report, the ""flight to quality"" trend has been evident in recent quarters as renewing tenants seek to take advantage of the soft market to ""trade up"" into higher-quality space, consistent with our view that the office sector shares many parallels with the retail space in the mid-2010s.:  () remained under pressure this week after additional analysts piled on the criticism of its announcement last week that it will spin-off its office assets into a separate externally-managed REIT as part of a ""strategic exit from office"" aimed at driving a ""re-rating"" of WPC's stock price, which has traded at discounted valuations to similar-sized peers. This week, we published  which discussed why these REITs have lagged in recent months as investors come to grips with a potential ""higher-for-longer"" interest rate environment. Thriving in the ""lower forever"" environment, the industry has been reluctant to acknowledge the higher-rate regime, keeping private-market values and cap rates stubbornly ""sticky"" and resulting in compressed investment spreads. Despite the tighter investment spreads, acquisition activity has slowed only modestly for some REITs - who have paid top-dollar for recent purchases - a strategy that could prove costly if rates remain elevated. Strong balance sheets and limited variable rate debt exposure had afforded these REITs the ability to be patient until the price is right, and while some REITs have exhibited prudence, others have plowed ahead with a ""business as usual"" approach or made seemingly unnecessary pivots, putting at risk decades of hard-fought progress.:  () - which we own in the  received a fresh Wall Street 'Buy' rating by UBS, with analyst Michael Goldsmith citing the rising demand for SFR rentals and a ""long runway"" for growth given the macroeconomic backdrop of a lingering housing shortage, aging millennials, and high cost of home ownership. UBS specifically likes INVH's ""infill product"" - upper-end suburban neighborhoods - which it expects will see particularly limited supply growth, while its tenant base is positioned to absorb rent increases. One of the best-performing property sectors this year, Single-Family Rental REITs have rebounded as the dire predictions of a ""hard landing"" in rental markets have been rebuffed in recent months by steadying rental rates and strong occupancy trends seen across the major rent indexes. While multifamily markets face supply headwinds over the next year, single-family builders have pulled back from an already historically supply-constrained single-family market, fundamentals that support sustained inflation-beating rent growth. These REITs have played it safe - a privilege earned through disciplined balance sheet management - but tighter financing conditions will be a catalyst to drive further market share gains to larger institutions that have access to cheaper and deeper capital.: A pair of externally-managed REITs advised by RMR Group -  () and () - traded sharply lower this week as both REITs announced Board and C-suite shakeups after their merger proposal failed to garner shareholder support.  announced the resignation and replacement of its Chief Financial Officer and appointed Christopher Bilotto - currently its Chief Operating Officer - as its new CEO. , meanwhile, announced the resignation of two of DHC's Board members who served on the DHC Board's special committee in connection with DHC's terminated merger plan and announced that B. Riley Securities has been engaged as its financial advisor to help it evaluate options to address near term capital needs including upcoming debt maturities. DHC also provided a business update, highlighting a continued recovery in its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (""SHOP""). Comparable occupancy rates increased to 79.3% in August - up 30 basis points from July - which was still 720 basis points below the pre-pandemic 2019 baseline of 86.5%. Higher rents have helped to offset some of the relative occupancy declines, however, with DHC noting that comparable revenue was only 7.6% below 2019-levels. Last week in , we noted that Senior Housing has emerged as a leader in recent quarters as the long-awaited post-pandemic occupancy recovery is finally taking hold, but other sub-sectors have regressed of late amid a combination of macro and sector-specific headwinds.Mortgage REITs were under pressure for a second week amid a rebound in interest rate volatility, as the closely-watched  jumped to one-month highs after calming to its lowest levels of the year in mid-September. The  () dipped 4.6% on the week, dragged on the downside by sharp declines from a handful of agency-focused residential mREITs amid pressure on residential mortgage-backed security (""RMBS"") valuations, with  () and  () among the notable laggards. Newsflow was light this week ahead of the start of mREIT earnings season in mid-October.  () was among the better-performers after it held its quarterly dividend steady at $0.40/share (16.0% dividend yield). In our we noted that mREITs stand on steadier ground with dividend coverage after a relatively solid slate of earnings results showing a modest increase in earnings per share.Book Values were in focus as the third-quarter wrapped up.  () slipped 3% after it announced that its book value per share was $14.30 at the end of August, down about 3% from the end of Q2. Spreads on mortgage-backed bonds (""MBS spreads"") - an important input into Book Value models - trended higher in the final two weeks of the quarter on the residential-side, but were little changed for commercial MBS. During the third-quarter, RMBS spreads widened by 9 basis points to 0.61%, while CMBS spreads narrowed by 2 basis points to 1.31%. While MBS spreads were generally steady during the quarter, benchmark interest rates - the other critical input affecting Book Values - have increased significantly during this period, with the 2-Year Yield jumping by 17 basis points. The  () - an un-levered benchmark tracking RMBS valuations - declined 3.7% during the quarter, while the  () posted declines of 1.2%, indicating downward pressure on mREIT Book Values in Q3.At the end of the third quarter, the  is lower by 8.3% on a price return basis for the year (-5.9% on a total return basis), while the  is lower by 0.1% (+4.9% on a total return basis). This compares with the 11.8% gain on the  and the 3.1% advance for the . Within the real estate sector, 4-of-18 property sectors are in positive territory on the year, led by Data Center, Single-Family Rental, Healthcare and Industrial REITs, while Net Lease and Cell Tower REITs have lagged on the downside. At 4.57%, the  has increased by 69 basis points since the start of the year - up sharply from its 2023 intra-day lows of 3.26% in April - and now hovering at 15-year highs . Following the worst year for bonds in decades, the  is lower again this year, producing total returns of -1.2% thus far.   - perhaps the most important inflation input - is higher by 15% this year but remains roughly 15% below 2022 peaks.Employment data highlights another critical week of economic data in the week ahead - but several of the reports would be delayed in the event of a government shutdown. The major report of the week - which would indeed be affected by a shutdown - comes on Friday with the , which is expected to show job growth of 165k in September, a moderation from the 187k in August. The closely-watched Average Hourly Earnings series within the payrolls report - which is the first major inflation print for September - is expected to show a continued moderation in wage growth to 4.3%. Wage growth slowed to 4.28% last month, the slowest since June 2021. Earlier in the week, we'll see  data on Tuesday,  data on Wednesday, and  data on Thursday - of which the ADP report would be the only release unaffected by a shutdown. 'Good news is bad news' will likely be the theme of these reports as several Fed officials have pinned their decisions to pivot away from aggressive monetary tightening on a long-awaited cooldown in labor markets. We'll also be watching  data on Monday, the OPEC meeting on Wednesday, and  (""PMI"") data from both ISM and S&P.           ,    ,     , and : Hoya Capital Real Estate advises two Exchange-Traded Funds listed on the NYSE.
