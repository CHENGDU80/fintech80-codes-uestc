0,Adyen Stock: Bear Cases And Blind Spots,About two months ago I wrote an article titled  I put my money where my mouth is and I have done what I wrote in the titleAs Im writingTo the subscribers of my Investing Group I wrote this about the stock slump this morningBut I want to remain very critical even more so now that I have bought a substantial position Thats why I wanted to write this article In this article I look at the bear cases and my own blind spotsBefore we go to the rest of the article though I want to explain the value proposition and the business model of Adyen once moreLets look at a company like Nike  one of Adyens customers As you probably know Nike sells products all around the world both online and offline Up to now Nikes POS pointofsale system is using many different playersAs you can see this is a complex system Nikes payment system is all over the world and therefore it uses dozens of different players for different parts of the payment processIn comes Adyen to help Nike This is how Nikes payment process looks after it became an Adyen customerAs you see the merchant and the cardholder are now connected through only Adyen and the schemes I think you can imagine that Adyen will be cheaper for Nike if this can be done especially because it can implement this worldwide Instead of all the different parties which all want their fee Nike has only to work with one AdyenThat also means that Nike will channel more and more of its business to Adyen over time New stores immediately implement Adyens POS but older ones still have to switch Thats why 80 of Adyens growth comes from existing customers who streamline their payment processOn top of that and also very important in the first situation without Adyen its almost impossible for Nike to have an overview of its customers through payments With Adyen that is not only possible but easy and datarichWhat you also shouldnt underestimate is the different payment methods that are popular in different countries If you are not Dutch for example you will probably never have heard of iDeal but it has a market share of 70 for online payments in the Netherlands Theres Alipay  Mercado Pago  and many other ways to pay around the world For every method in every country new intermediaries have to be set up For Nike its much easier to just go to Adyen which has this set up already and Nike can just plugandplay as it wereI hope you see the strength of Adyens business Its not just something that can be replaced easily once customers are on board especially not because its more expensive than just staying with AdyenAt the same time as Adyen has become a much bigger position now I dont want to be a victim of some investment biases There are several that could be working hereRecently I  this on X formerly Twitter1 2 3 and 5 may be applicable here while many investors will struggle with 4 Their recency bias will let them think the stock cant go up anymore Thats what often happens when a stock is up people think it cant go down When its down they think it cant go up Thats recency bias in full swing I can say without blinking that I have no real problem with this bias when it comes to my own mindsetI think that I have to be careful with the four other biases though And thats the reason for this article I want to be critical about Adyen before I add even more to my position After all I could be wrong rightConfirmation bias means you only look at what you want to see at what confirms your beliefs Therefore I want to look at the bearish arguments I have seen and weigh them  I can only agree that the stock price could drop more but that is always the case for any investment If you are a trader or a market timer this is very important to you but thats not me I invest and if my thesis plays out I want to hold on as long as possible I probably dont need the money for the next 20 yearsIn other word,75,2023-10-26,7
1,Does A Blowout Third Quarter GDP Number Vindicate Bidenomics?,On October 26th the first calculation of third quarter US Gross Domestic Product will be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis The most recent Bloomberg forecasts show a substantial increase over theThe mean of current projections for tomorrows third quarter GDP release is 34 percent with a median of 35 percent drawn from 73 forecasts ranging from 003 percent to 54 percentThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantas GDPNow estimate as of today is 54 percent If realized the Bloomberg mean estimate would represent a 62 percent jump over the second quarter reading the Atlanta Feds number a leap of 157 percentIf the third quarter GDP number were to come in at 45 percent or higher it would be the highest quarterly return sinceMore important than historical comparisons though would be answers to the following questions Where in the components of GDP would such strength be coming from especially considering that Fed rate hikes are beginning to exert a decelerating effect on the US economyIs it a consequence of policy or random economic interactions at the micro meso and macro levels And does such a bounce in GDP portend a return to robust economic output or a capricious insignificant surgeIt is difficult to say in advance But several factors behind the estimates for a strong third quarter number are likely among the indexs constituents US consumers have continued to buoy the US economy as evidenced by the strength of discretionary spending on the  and  films the  and  tours and  have also been rising as well most recently owing to firms stocking up on supplies in anticipation of broadening labor unrestThe balance of US exports and imports will factor in but other than a  since July 2023 which drags on US exports while increasing the marketability of imports those numbers tend to be volatile from one quarter to the next and thus difficult to predictAnd private nonresidential fixed investment which alongside consumption was the other  to the prior GDP release is likely to play a significant role in tomorrows number as taxpayerprovided subsidies from the  the  and the  continue to flowIf the bottom line third quarter GDP number shakes out as the Feds GDPNow and Bloomberg survey are hinting and the elements listed above are the cause consumption private nonresidential fixed investment private inventories and perhaps some help from trade it is probably not indicative of a renewal of strong economic growthOther than the three federal spending laws which are legislatively engineered to disburse government funds at regular intervals providing an ongoing business spending boost to the US economy through the 2024 election cycle the remainder of the factors are fickleConsumers still spending have eaten through their pandemic savings are borrowing at rates not seen in 40 years and face both contracting credit and the return of student loan paymentsThe end of federal child care subsidies and mortgage rates at quartercentury highs are adding to spending headwinds American consumption has been impressive and somewhat mysterious of late but cannot continue indefinitelyAccumulated private inventories will either be sold or drawn down once the latest wave of labor activism subsides Government spending is likely nearly the same from the second to the third quarter and the impact of trade remains to be seenBehind all of these questions  if indeed a blowout third quarter US GDP number appears tomorrow morning  is a weightier issue How will the Fed respondA strong GDP number is likely to send Treasury bond yields up in anticipation of another rate hike possibly dragging the 10year note back above 5 percent Whatever the specific sources within tomorrows GDP an overall increase by the estimated magnitude is likely to motivate the Fed to intensify its efforts redoubling its contractionary policy biasOnce more its important to note that this is an anticipatory scenario,4,2023-10-25,3
2,"Extreme Weather Is Making Major Trade Routes Less Reliable, And It's Only Going To Get Worse",Waterways have always been crucial for transport Theyre a cheap and environmentally friendly waySeveral regions across the world including parts of the Southwestern and South Central US Chile Southern and Western Europe and North Central China saw belowaverage annual precipitation last year leading to driedout soil and lower streamflow and groundwater In Europe for example this led to the Rhine  one of the busiest waterways in the world  having a water level of less than 135cm at the Kaub gauging station in Germany on 154 days in 2022 The 135cm mark is what large container ships need to navigate the river This figure has trended upwardFrom here on out the outlook isnt shaping up to be a particularly rosy one with the discharge volume of the Rhine depending heavily on meltwater which is quickly diminishing Swiss glaciers the source of the Rhine also lost 10 of ice volume in just two years according to the Swiss Academy of Sciences Structurally decreasing snow levels mean that water volumes turn more volatile and averages are generally set to trend down moving forwardAlongside important navigable rivers including the Mississippi in the US the Yangtze in China and the Amazon in Brazil one of the most important international waterways  the Panama Canal  has been hit by a severe drought over the course of 2023 The 80 kilometrelong canal connects North and South America and is the most important trade route for the movement of goods between Asia and the east coast of the US handling about five percent of total world trade volume per year Since the canal is designed as a lock system each ship that passes through the canal requires about 200 million litres of fresh water which is roughly equivalent to the household water use of 4500 inhabitants in European countriesLow water levels lead to capacity reduction on ships surcharges rising transportation costs and delays For example the Panama Canal is currently only navigable with a reduced ship weight and a limited number of ships From 1 November only 31 ships are allowed through the canal per day compared to usually 3638 ship crossings daily The Canal authorities decided to extend the passthrough restrictions until mid2024 On top of this theres also a depth limitation for vessels 44 feet or 135 metres which leads to lower loading capacity AsiaUS container spot rates  under heavy pressure from excess capacity and faltering world trade growth  at least showed signs of a revivalDevelopment port to port containerised freight tariffs in US per FEU 40ft containerIn Europe shipping costs on the Rhine spike each time there are periods of extremely low water as capacity is instantly reduced Shipping contracts usually contain low water clauses that provide a graduated surcharge when levels drop eg below 150cm at the Kaub measuring point along the Rhine Prices are usually subject to a graduated surcharge the lower the water level the higher the surcharge Dutch inland waterway transport costs for shippers which cover roughly half of the Rhine bed traffic rose by 52 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the previous year and by 76 in the third quarter of 2022 Worryingly these costs increase with each low water periodPrice developments in Dutch inland navigation Index 2015  100Low water levels inevitably result in delays In the US extremely low water levels in the Mississippi River  which is critical for the transportation of agricultural commodities like grains and draining about 40 of the continental US area  logjammed more than 100 towboats in 2022 and led to loading reductions and significant delays for barges This year shippers have once again faced delays and higher rates threatening the harvest season Water levels of the Amazon fell to century lows in midOctober 2023 damaging the ecosystem and also disrupting cargo flows up the inland port of ManausFrom a macroeconomic point of view the di,6,2023-10-10,3
3,China Curbs Exports Of Battery-Making Graphite As Global Tech War Escalates,Citing national security concerns Beijing said onUnder the new restrictions China will require exporters to apply for permits to ship two types of graphite including high purity highhardness and high intensity synthetic graphite material and natural flake graphite and its productsMeanwhile it dropped temporary controls on five less sensitive graphite items used in basic industries such as steel metallurgy and chemicalsChina dominates global supply chains of graphite the raw material essential for EV batteries Graphite demand is expected to riseThe EU listed natural graphite as a critical raw material in 2020 The US also considers it to be a critical and strategic mineralBeijings move comes days after Washington tightened controls on exports of semiconductors to China including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by Nvidia The EV supply chain has become a source of escalating feud between Beijing and the West Last month the European Union said it was weighing levying tariffs on Chinesemade EVs arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidiesChina dominates the global supply chain of critical minerals needed to make EV batteries from material processing to the construction of cell and battery components This is a result of Beijings early push towards electrification particularly through subsidising EVsThe curbs are similar to those placed in August on  key metals used to make semiconductors and electronicsExports of the two metals had surged before the controls went into effect but have fallen in recent months Meanwhile prices outside China have increasedChina is the worlds top producer and exporter of the mineral It also refines over 90 of the worlds graphite into the anode material used in EV batteries Top buyers of graphite from China include the US South Korea Japan Poland and India Chinese Customs data showsGraphite can be found naturally or produced synthetically Natural graphite is the mined graphite which is then processed into an enduse product that can be used in the battery industryNatural graphite is primarily mined in China and Mozambique Synthetic graphite is produced by utilising a carbon precursor product typically petroleum coke needle coke or coal tar pitch and made into graphite through a process called graphitisationA natural graphite anode generally benefits from smaller costs and lower energy consumption than a synthetic anode But synthetic graphite is popular thanks to its higher purity and most lithiumion batteries rely on it these daysOther countries that mine graphite include Brazil Mozambique Russia Madagascar Ukraine Norway North Korea Canada and IndiaIn 2022 China took the top spot by mining 850000 tonnes of the mineral accounting for 65 of the global total Brazil came a very distant second with 87000 tonnes while other countries mined significantly less according to the US Geological Survey USGSAfrica has been a recent focus for graphite exploration with projects under development in Madagascar Mozambique Namibia and TanzaniaUkraine and Russia were among the top 10 producers of graphite before the conflict according to USGS In February last year Ukraine halted graphite productionOperations resumed in August however future production is uncertain as the conflict continues As well many countries have suspended trade relations with Russia which has removed supplies of Russian graphite from much of the global marketGraphite is the largest component by volume in an EV battery It makes up 9599 of the anode negative electrode material in lithiumion batteries in varying natural and synthetic combinationsIn lithiumion batteries graphite cannot be substituted as it helps improve electrical conductivity and acts as a host for lithium ions Cathode the other half of the battery constitutes lithium nickel and cobaltGraphite prices are likely to rise but Chinas latest move will also,13,2023-10-19,7
4,U.S. Retail Sales Confirms 4% GDP Growth Is On The Cards,The September US retails sales report was significantly better than expected posting a monthonmonth gain of 07 versus 03 expected while retail sales growth for August has also been revised higher to 08 fromWith the control group also looking strong at 06 MoM and this subset historically moving more in line with broader consumer spending trends it indicates we should be looking for thirdquarter GDP growth to be in the region of 4 Coupled with the recent strong jobs numbers and hot inflation it is no surprise that Treasury yields push higher While Fed officials may be coalescing around the view that further policy rate hikes may not be needed the prospect of interest rate cuts is in the faroff future and the yield curve needs to continue repricing for thatSo why have economists got it so wrong yet again Well the weakening trend we are seeing in consumer confidence is one factor as households continue to worry about the economic outlook and what might happen in the jobs market at a time when spending power is under pressure from lingering inflation Another reason is that the Bureau of Economic Analysis now publishes weekly credit card spending transaction usage and this was down sharply in September Given this is how most people typically spend money especially online this should give a good read through for general spending patterns For auto sales it will obviously be different but this discrepancy is surprising as it is doubtful we will all suddenly be using cash againWe continue to think that the constraints facing the household sector of falling real household disposable income reduced credit availability more and more households running down accrued pandemic era savings and the resumption of student loan repayments will eventually lead to weaker consumer spending numbers It isnt happening yet though and will mean market rates continue to move higher with mortgage rates car loans and credit card borrowing rates inevitably following suit which will only add to the headwinds for consumer spending as we move into 2024This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular users means financial situation or investment objectives The information does not constitute investment recommendation and nor is it investment legal or tax advice or an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell any financial instrument ,10,2023-10-20,3
5,Adyen: Why I'm Buying With Both Hands,LastThe huge drop in Adyens share price was a real surprise I had already shared previously to my subscribers that it could be that the market would react negatively to Adyens hiring spree again just like it did in H2 2022 But I would never have guessed something like this would happenFor those who dont know Adyen its a payment provider that mainly focuses on huge customers such as Spotify Unlike other platforms the company has not stitched together several payment platforms to offer its services but has built everything from the ground up Thats why it also has the lowest cost to service its customers But because it also has a better product it usually charges a premium price That model was somewhat under pressure in the first half of this yearThese were the numbers Adyen reported for the first six months of 2023You can see these illustrated here  The company added this context for the EBITDA dropWhen it came to EBITDA the results were as I expected pressure on profitability because of the increased hiring spreeJust to remind you as I wrote  Adyen didnt hire much during the pandemic as it judged tech people were too expensive back then and they asked for too much stockbased compensation Now that so many big tech companies Meta Alphabet Microsoft etc have done layoffs Adyen started hiring at high speed to be ready for the next growth phase Of course that temporarily impacts profitabilityTo me this countercyclical move is a great example of longterm thinkingFor context Adyen is still hugely profitable with an EBITDA margin of 43 So its not as if the company sacrifices profitability for growth It invests some of its huge profitability to invest for the future Isnt what companies are supposed to doAdyen hired 551 fulltime equivalents of which 75 were in tech Adyen was disappointed that in North America it couldnt find enough affordable tech employees to reach its goals Especially for sales roles which also has tech people as they have to understand the needs of customers Adyen couldnt hire fast enough in the previous periods and thats one of the reasons why North American revenue only grew by 23The company has always said it sees longterm revenue growth of mid20 to 30 and EBITDA margins of 65 and it reaffirmed these goals for the mediumtermBefore we look at more details just this thought about the stock price drop firstIf you Google Adyens results you see thisThe reason is simple Up to this earnings release Adyen had to report gross revenue because of accounting standards It changed its terms and conditions and can now recognize revenue in another way Thats also why the net profit margin is up so muchAdyen has to pay other parties involved in the payment process Think of Visa  and Mastercard  but also banks etc Thats totally normal in payments but it doesnt give a clear picture Thats why Adyen has always reported Net Revenue to investorsHow much of the initial selling pressure has to do with this strange anomaly We all know bots are programmed to buy or sell if they see certain patterns A 78 drop in revenue is definitely one of those patterns The automatic selling then triggers stop losses and that can cascadeWe saw something similar for Globale  The company had fantastic earnings but the stock dropped by 15 The reason A data provider had switched Q2 2022 and Q2 2023 so instead of 53 up revenue looked to drop by 53 Of course the other things we saw at Adyen like the pressure on EBITDA because of accelerated hiring only fortified the bots Lets look at these things now investors saw was the  Just like in the previous quarter according to the companys plan Adyen continued adding employees at a fast pace Adyen also raised wages Just to make sure these are still much below Silicon Valley wages on average I think both are great and bashing Adyen for doing this is just plain shortsightedness Management sai,5,2023-10-17,1
6,Oil Rallies On Middle East Tension,Following Hamas devastating attacks on Israel over the weekend and the retaliatory actions taken by Israel in Gaza it is no surprise that the oil market opened stronger thisIsrael is a very marginal oil producer and so recent developments will have little direct impact on oil supply However given the rising tension in the region and the risk that the conflict could spread market participants will remain nervous until there is a clear deescalationLooking at the medium to longer term there hasWhile oil fundamentals have not changed since these attacks it does not mean they wont There are reports that Iran helped Hamas plan the attacks and gave them the green light If this is proven to be true we could see the US an ally of Israel taking a tougher stance against Iran which could ultimately lead to a reduction in oil supplyThe US administration has taken a much softer approach to Iran in recent months when it comes to sanctions While US oil sanctions against Iran remain in place they have not been strongly enforced This is evident by the growth in Iranian oil supply over the course of this year Output has grown from around 25MMbblsd at the start of the year to around 3MMbblsd currently The softer approach from the US is likely due to concern over rising energy prices However it would be difficult to see the US maintaining this stance if Iran is connected to these attacks whether directly or indirectly Enforcing these sanctions more strictly would mean the potential loss of at least 500MbblsdThe implication of losing this supply would be that the global oil balance would be tighter throughout 2024 At the moment we are assuming Iranian supply remains in the region of 3MMbblsd through next year but clearly there is downside risk to this given recent developmentsIf this loss materialises the surplus we currently forecast in 1Q24 would largely disappear leaving the market roughly in balance early next year For the remainder of 2024 we would see deeper deficits particularly over 2H24 Under this scenario there would be some upside risk to our current Brent forecast of US90bbl for next yearWe do not expect OPEC to adjust their output policy as a result of recent developments However if we were to see significant strength in prices ie Brent trading above 100bbl there is a possibility that Saudi Arabia would start to unwind their additional voluntary supply cut of 1MMbblsd These are levels where the Saudis would start to become increasingly concerned over the potential for demand destruction The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,233,2023-08-22,2

17,Key Risks To The Global Outlook,A lack of transparency and a convoluted financing system have raised fears that the problems of ChinasLGFVs developed out of the limitations of tax revenue raising for local governments and have been a way for local governments to boost expenditure on infrastructure and invigorate the local economyLocal governments are usually the sole or dominant shareholders of the LGFV which issues debt that may be bought by banks and other financial institutions to pay for these projects  say social housing or roads and bridges The returns on these infrastructure projects are frequently insufficientThis process has led to a substantial buildup of LGFV debt and in turn bank exposure to such debt The scale of LGFV debt is now about CNY 55 trillion according to PIMCO estimates Banks are on the hook for about 60 of that which accounts for about 15 of total loans Smaller regional banks are the most exposedClearly the problems of the property sector cut this financing loop raising the risk of LGFV default However while individual defaults cannot be ruled out  and some have already occurred  we consider the risks of a systemic banking crisis to be low The central government and the Peoples Bank of China PBoC are both committed to preventing a systemic crisis The playbook for local governments that have run into difficulties with LGFV debt so far is debt restructuring This will of course squeeze the returns that banks expected on their exposure to this sector and lower their profitability As a result some banks may need to raise capital to make up for any lossesMeanwhile the government is keeping the property development sector on life support through targeted assistance measures These are being implemented alongside considerable supplyside improvements in order to help the functioning of the real estate market more generally and allow local governments to issue other special bonds to pay outstanding liabilities more cheaply than LGFV debt Consequently while the real estate market is hardly thriving massive failure has largely been avoided Companies like Evergrande are being quietly absorbed or broken up rather than being allowed to fail spectacularly with the ensuing collateral damage that this would implyAs a result financing difficulties are likely to be spread out over multiple years  this limits the risk of a systemic crisis but suggests that an extended period of adjustment and possibly constrained credit extension as well as weaker economic growth looks likelyThere seems to be a growing view within the European Central Bank ECB that in order to get inflation further under control policy rate hikes might not be sufficient In fact the risk of worsening the current stagnation in the eurozone with additional rate hikes is high In times of inverted yield curves the ECBs focus is likely to shift to noninterest rate tools again Based on official comments since the September ECB meeting an earlier end to reinvestments under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme PEPP than the current end of 2024 has become more likelyThe risk associated with an earlier end of the PEPP reinvestments is an unwarranted widening of spreads particularly during a time when fiscal policies in the eurozone will turn more restrictive and the entire fiscal framework  the Stability and Growth Pact  is still subject to revisions Consequently an earlier unwinding of PEPP would return financial markets focus back to debt sustainability issues in the eurozone The monetary union is clearly more solid and better prepared than in 2010 to weather a new sovereign debt crisis However as long as inflation remains above target the ECB will not be able to perform the role of unconditional lender of last resort Instead of whatever it takes the ECB will only be able to offer its Transmission Protection Instrument No single crisis ever repeats identically but an earlier unwinding of the PEPP reinvestments clearly b,0,2023-10-28,3

23,Bank Of Japan Preview: New Macro Forecasts Will Shed Light On Next Policy Move,The BoJs ultraloose monetary policy continues to pile pressure on Japans financial markets The 10Y JGB yield isThe weakening yen is putting more pressure on inflation which will eventually hurt consumption and a sharp rise in rates will likely hurt business investment Increasing bond purchase operations meanwhile will put more of a burden on the BoJHowever the central bank is not yetIf the BoJ were to leave the current policy settings unchanged however financial markets might move in the opposite direction to the BoJs wishes and the economic recovery could falter especially with growing concerns of a global economic slowdown Also a fresh outlook report will be released on the same day which could support a policy change However if the BoJ misses the chance next week it still leaves open the possibility of making such a decision at its December meeting By then the FOMCs decision will have been announced and the impact of the policy action could be even greater at a time when market volumes are thin at the end of the yearWe think scrapping the YCC policy is too radical for the BoJ and the central bank will likely keep the current 1 flexible cap In light of Governor Kazuo Uedas comments at the last meeting that the appropriate level for the 10Y JGB is below 1 the BoJ is unlikely to take the 1 limit any higherInstead it is possible that the BoJ might lift its 10Y JGB target from the current level of around 0 to 025 or to 05 the current formal upper limit of 10Y JGB to reflect the current market conditions Bringing the anchor year of the yield forward from the current 10Y to 5Y is also a possible option Or the BoJ could make changes to its forward guidance It would be more effective to signal to the market that the BoJ is gradually moving toward normalisation If such changes come with a higher outlook for inflation in FY23 and beyond it would give a clearer signal to the marketEven if the Bank of Japan doesnt deliver any policy changes the market will keep a close eye on how the central banks growth and inflation outlook has changed and it could still be a marketmoving event mainly because it could give hints about future policy movesSince the quarterly projection release in July both growth and inflation have exceeded the BoJs forecasts Annual FY23 GDP is expected to be significantly upgraded to around 19 vs 13 in July forecast and 18 market consensus as GDP growth in the first half of this year has been stronger than expected Yet FY2425 GDP forecasts are expected to be little changed as global headwinds intensifyThe markets focus will be on the inflation outlook because the BoJ is aiming to meet the sustainable 2 price target a major prerequisite for rate action We believe that core CPI excluding fresh food for FY23 will be dramatically upgraded to around 29 vs 25 in the July forecast and 27 market consensus Energy prices had climbed even before the IsraelHamas conflict began and service prices rose more than the BoJ expected The energy subsidy programmes are likely to be extended until April next year but inflation will likely stay above 2 More importantly we expect the BoJ to raise its FY24 core CPI forecast to around 21 vs 19 in the July forecast and the 19 market consensus incorporating the recent rise in global commodity prices Also the base effect related to the energy subsidy programmes is likely to cause a temporary spike in inflation above 3 in February In our own estimation core CPI excluding fresh food will likely remain above 2 almost throughout 2024As argued in  we believe that three conditions must be met for the BoJs policy rate action 1 Inflation above 2 2 wage growth of around 3 and 3 a positive GDP output gap We still think 2Q24 should be the right time for the BoJs first rate action Inflation will likely stay well above 2 in the first half of 2024 Major wage negotiation results should be ,1,2023-10-26,3

28,Biofuel Demand Strengthens The Business Case For U.S. Agribusiness,Farmers are often both food producers and suppliers of a range of raw materials with the latter now becoming more important than everThere are a number of feedstocks that the US biofuels industry uses to produce biofuels Corn is by far the largest representing over 90 of the volume with most corn being processed into conventional ethanol The second largest feedstock for biofuels is soybean oil making up around 3 of the total feedstock used Animal fats used cooking oil UCO and vegetable oils like soybean oil are generally turned into biodiesel orUsing corn to produce ethanol initially took off following the Renewable Fuel Standards RFS in the mid2000s and Californias LowCarbon Fuel Standards LCFS Weve written about these policies in a bit more detail previously  The number of corn bushels used for ethanol has been relatively stable in the last decadeWere now seeing strong growth in the use of other feedstocks which is mainly the result of  The expansion in refining capacity has led to additional demand for animal fats and UCO but we also see more soybean and canola oil from oilseed crushers and corn oil from distillers being turned into renewable diesel Increased production of renewable diesel is mainly taking place at the expense of biodiesel and total renewable diesel production volume has overtaken biodiesel production for the first time in 2023Both animal fats and UCO are rapidly approaching their supply limits according to the International Energy Agency The US already has high UCO collection rates so its also looking abroad for additional supply  and this means that competition between the US and the EU for Asian UCO supply is heating up The future supply picture for animal fats is mixed US cattle inventory is following a downward trend limiting the growth potential for beef tallow the most important animal fat used in biofuels Larger supplies from the poultry industry can partly offset this due to the growth in the number of broilersThe biofuel market continues to evolve and we see varying demand outlooks for different feedstocks Since corn ethanol demand from the road transportation sector has likely peaked already overcoming hurdles to enter the market for sustainable aviation fuels remains a key concern Given the ongoing growth in renewable diesel capacity there is clearly more growth potential for fats and vegetable oils Ethanol producers and oilseed crushers are also busy with upgrading the protein content in their other products to tap into higher valueadded feed and food applicationsCorn is the most widely used feedstock when it comes to biofuel production in the US specifically for ethanol production The ethanol sector accounts for around 38 of total corn consumption which is up significantly from just 6 in the early 2000s Historically the view has been that there is a blending wall for the US ethanol industry with the widely accepted barrier being at 10 However its become more apparent in recent years that this blend wall does not appear to be as impenetrable as previously thought with the ethanol blending rate in the US exceeding 10 since 2016 The growing availability of E15 and the capacity for a larger share of the vehicle fleet running on it would have helped to break above 10 Any car with a model year 2001 or newer is approved to run on E15 which is basically almost 96 of the car fleetA further increase in blending rates will likely drive any growth in US ethanol demand from the road transportation sector However given efficiency gains in cars with combustion engines and the growing share of electric vehicle EV sales road fuel demand in the US is likely to decline in the coming years In turn this will reduce the amount of ethanol that will be neededIn the next decade we expect downward pressure to emerge on the demand for biofuels in road transportation  especially in the latter part of this decade Because current biofuel product,1,2023-10-23,6

30,End Of Europe's Exemption For Ship Alliances Adds To Tough Market Conditions,The European Commission has announced it will not extend the block exemption for container liners which expires 25 April 2024 This exemption enabledThe exemption in the cyclical container liner market was first introduced during the global financial crisis in 2009 and extended in 2014 and again in 2022 In the early stage of the pandemic  when container linersContainer rates have collapsed since early 2022 and spot rates on Asia to Europe trade have dropped below prepandemic levels The sector has also faced a combination of faltering demand and a flood of newly ordered vessel capacity coming online However the European Commission has acted in light of what it sees as structural market changes There has been consolidation And on top of this several liner companies including Maersk CMA CGM and MSC have actively taken stakes in port terminals logistics services providers and even air freight services over the past two years With this integration these companies have developed a presence across supply chains and an ability to offer endtoend logistics solutionsThe expiry of the block exemption means that cooperation in terms of joint services will be restricted and managing capacity by for instance taking out blanking sailings will be more difficult For some container liners it will also be more difficult to offer specific port calls to clients Profits in container shipping have been on a downward track from elevated levels since the second quarter of 2022 Global container volumes have been falling this year and are expected to grow only slightly this year amid global headwinds for trade At the same time the market is set to be flooded by a wave of new vessels coming online TEU capacity will be expanded by some 27 in 20232025 making the conditions in container shipping more challengingThe EU and US have followed the same approach regarding the exemption with the ruling also under review in the US Either way the EU is already part of large trade routes and the lifting of the exemption will limit the room to cooperate and weigh on market conditions especially for pure container liners MSC and Maersk decided earlier to dismantle their cooperation possibly because market leader MSC has become big enough by itself The other two alliances wont necessarily cease to exist but there will probably be a higher regulatory burden for joint operations under general competition rules This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular users means financial situation or investment objectives The information does not constitute investment recommendation and nor is it investment legal or tax advice or an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell any financial instrument Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks,1,2023-10-11,2

33,Surging Oil Prices: A New Concern For Central Banks,Surging oil prices have become the new concern for central banks aggravating the current trilemma how to balance slowing economies still toohigh inflation and the delayed impact of unprecedentedLooking ahead the recent surge in oil prices will make things even more complicated as it will both worsen the economic slowdown but also push up inflation or at least reduce the disinflationary trend Balancing growth and inflation will become even harder and future interest rate decisions will not only be determined by these two variables but also by central banks credibilityIn this regard central banks most concerned about their credibility and the longerterm impact on inflation expectations could end up continuing to hikeOil prices are currently up by more than 25 this quarter and even briefly reached 95bbl Our commodities analyst Warren Patterson expects oil prices to break above 100bbl in the near term as supply cuts by OPEC countries more than offset weaker demand due to the global economys slowdownHowever he doesnt see oil prices remaining above 100bbl for long as weaker demand and political pressure to increase supply should help to bring oil prices back to levels slightly above 90bblIn our September Monthly update we argued that the current inflation situation is and that a second inflation wave looked highly unlikely However we also admitted that in the late 1970s the second energy crisis was the main driver for the second inflation wave in many countriesIn the eurozone there were three peak periods for inflation in the 1970s The first was in 1974 when headline inflation was close to 14 the second in 1977 with headline inflation above 10 and then again in late 1979 and early 1980 with headline inflation back at doubledigit levels Back then real wage growth remained positive even during the spikes of the oil crises which allowed inflation to remain above 7 for more than a decade 197284 Indeed the countries that experienced higher real wage growth for the period also experienced the highest inflation over this period see chart belowThe current surge in inflation is different in that real wage growth turned negative quickly which has slowed consumer demand drastically This makes the chances of a prolonged second spike in inflation much smaller With inflation currently trending down and wage growth stabilising above 4 real wage growth is set to turn positive again soon but we wouldnt expect it to erase the losses from the past two yearsAt the same time it is important to note that government support and employment growth have limited disposable income losses quite substantiallyWhile this wont be a replay of the 1970s expectations of further disinflation will be impacted by higher oil prices This could result in a slower decline of inflation to 2 Given that our expectations for oil prices do include a drop in the first half of 2024 again the effect on our own forecast is rather moderate Plus a smaller decline in energy prices has materialised this year compared to expectations which impacts next years base effectsThe estimates below give a sense of how inflation could vary under alternative scenarios for oil but also natural gas Assuming oil prices stay at 95bbl for all of 2024 however the eurozone headline figure would rise by 03ppt next year with a peak of the energy price contribution of 1ppt in the second quarter At the same time higher oil prices would probably further dent consumer confidence and spending thereby contributing to the current disinflationary trend due to weaker demandIts a similar story in the UK though even in a higher oilgas price scenario the contribution from energy is still likely to be negative in the first half The impact of lower natural gas prices comes through with more of a lag and will offset the impact of higher petrol prices The impact of rapidly slowing food price inflation also means that headline CPI ,1,2023-10-06,1

40,Bank Of Canada Preview: Stretching The 'Hawkish Hold' Approach,Market expectations for the upcoming Bank of Canada policy meeting have fluctuated quite a lot since the last policyHowever since then the data has been moving in the opposite direction and after the September inflation readings the probability of a hike next week has crashed back down to 17 This week September CPI figures showed a fasterthanexpected slowdown in all measures ofIt isnt only the latest inflation number that has surprised The economy posted a shock contraction in the second quarter and since then activity has flatlined with wildfires floods and strike action all acting as a brake on activity in addition to the cumulative effects of policy tightening from the Bank of Canada The BoC Business Outlook indicator slumped further in the third quarter on the back of weaker demand expectations as well as a reduced plan for hiring and capex spendingWith an increasing number of households facing mortgage rate resets at much higher borrowing rates there is a concern that highly indebted households will feel intensifying pain over coming quarters We have already seen three consecutive monthly declines in home sales and further weakness is likely with affordability looking incredibly stretchedCanadas jobs market has surprised even the most optimistic forecasters recently August and September saw employment rising by a total of over 100k equally split between part and fulltime hiring while unemployment remained low at 55In a recent speech the BoC Governor said  stressing the importance of inflation expectations and wage growth Wage inflation has been on the upside according to official data touching 53 yearonyear in September after four consecutive months of acceleration Wage figures in Canada tend however to be rather volatileThe BoC puts a lot of weight on the BoC Business Outlook survey and the third quarter issue contained a few notions that partly offset the strong labour market narrative Firms reported expected wage growth at around 43 for the year ahead a fifth consecutive quarteronquarter decline with a record 60 of respondents expecting increases in labour costs to abate in the next 12 monthsIncidentally hiring intentions have declined in tandem with collapsing investment plans and are at the lowest since the third quarter of 2020 A key driver of strong employment gains  supply shortages  also appears to be abating the BoC indicator of labour shortage intensity has dropped to the lowest since 2009We must add another factor to the equation higher bond yields Canadian sovereign yields have jumped in line with the US ones reaching a peak a 424 peak in early October and now trading around 410  over 100bp higher compared to when the BoC last met in September BoC speakers have not been as vocal as their Fed counterparts about the link between higher market yields and lower chances of another hike but there are few reasons to believe they strongly oppose such a line of reasoningWhen adding the clouded growth pictures and indications that the extreme tightness in labour market may not last much longer we see little scope for a surprise rate hike by the BoC on 25 October However policymakers still have all the interest to keep the higherforlonger narrative to keep a floor below Canadian yields and let them do part of the tighteningMoving ahead we are of the view that economic weakness will also contribute to inflation continuing to slow to target meaning no further rate hikes from the Bank of Canada We see the potential for the BoC having to start to reversing course and bring policy rates towards a more neutral level from the second quarter of 2024 onwardsThe CAD OIS curve is pricing only 4bp ahead of the October meeting meaning that a hold is a very welltelegraphed outcome and should not have a major impact perse Markets will primarily focus on the content of the monetary policy report revisions of the inflation and growth projections will be ,0,2023-10-18,3

45,The Labour Market Conundrum Keeps The Eurozone Economy Just About Afloat,The latest economic data continues to confirm our scenario of a weakening growth environment in the eurozone though the slowdown is no longer intensifying as most indicators have stabilisedThat said there doesnt seem to be an upturn in the offing Inventory levels remain quite high and according to the PMI survey orders in both manufacturing and services have softened further to levels not seen since the pandemic This doesnt bode well for the fourth quarter and thats theThe question is what happens afterwards Most international institutions see a stronger growth rate in 2024 than in 2023 The current cycle has indeed some special features one of them being the demographically induced labour scarcity Because of that we are now experiencing the rare combination of weak business sentiment and declining unemployment the eurozone unemployment rate was at a record low in August The fact that the labour market is holding up well and that real wages are now rising is certainly a factor that supports consumption and for the time being prevents the current downturn from morphing into a fullblown recessionHowever concluding from this that growth can only accelerate is perhaps a bit premature Lets not forget that monetary policy works with a lag And we have reasons to believe that the lag might be a bit longer than in the past as the long period of low and even negative interest rates has probably allowed companies and governments to lengthen the duration of their debt That said credit growth was close to a standstill on a yearonyear basis in August and this trend is unlikely to reverse anytime soon On top of that there is still no agreement on a revamped Stability and Growth Pact meaning that member states must abide by the old rules and present significantly more restrictive budgets this month Several member states are at risk of the excessive deficit budget procedure probably leading to some spread widening Putting it all together we only see some genuine improvement in the growth outlook from the second half of 2024 onwards But we forecast this will result in a mere 04 GDP growth for the whole of 2024 after 05 this yearBoth headline and core inflation fell in September to 43 and 45 respectively and that was better than expected However one must bear in mind that base effects play a very important role in the recent decline Thats why we like to look at the 3month on 3month annualised rate of inflation showing the headline rate at 40 and core at 36 Although softening the trend is thus still clearly above 2 On top of that the recent oil price increase is likely to keep headline inflation higher in the first half of 2024 We are now anticipating 59 headline inflation for this year and 30 for 2024The ECB increased its main interest rates again in September bringing the interest rate on the deposit facility to 4 a 450 basis point increase in just 14 months The monetary policy statement suggested that the top might have been reached though rates will have to be kept high for a sufficiently long duration to bring inflation back to target That is the reason why we shifted our expectation for a first rate cut to the third quarter of 2024 The ECB is also considering ending the reinvestment of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme holdings early to diminish the amount of excess liquidity An announcement to do so could fall in the first quarter of next year All of this limits the potential for a substantial bond rallyThis publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular users means financial situation or investment objectives The information does not constitute investment recommendation and nor is it investment legal or tax advice or an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell any financial instrument ,0,2023-10-07,3

50,BRICS Expansion And What It Means For The U.S. Dollar,The BRICS grouping of major emerging economies Brazil India China South Africa and Russia is holding its fifteenth summit later this month Up for discussion an expansion ofAny expansion of the BRICS grouping could determine the speed with which the bloc adopts commercial and financial systems outside of the dollar sphere Speculation is rife as to how many countries if any will join the club  for the first expansion in a decade In order to evaluate how the political ambitions correlate with underlying economic trends we take a closer look at the overall evolution of the US dollars roleOverall we do not see any conclusive evidence that the dollar is on the path of structural decline at this point However it is still facing challenges stemming from both economics and geopoliticsThe war in Ukraine and the freezing of Russian FX reserves in 2022 have prompted much discussion on the weaponisation of the dollar the splintering of geopolitical blocs and ultimately the inexorable decline in the use of the dollar  or dedollarisation An integral part of this debate will not only be how those geopolitical groupings develop but also whether other currencies can challenge the dollars international roleWe suspect the subject of dedollarisation might gain some traction this summer when senior leaders of the BRICS nations meet in South Africa on 2224 August At the top of the summits agenda is the proposed expansion of this geopolitical grouping and perhaps some proposals relating to a common payment system in BRICS currencies Regarding BRICS expansion speculation is rife as to how many countries if any will join the club  for the first expansion in a decade The focus here tends to be on countries that have already joined the BRICSsponsored New Development Bank NDB These include countries such as the United Arab Emirates Egypt and BangladeshThe proponents for accelerated change argue that some of the major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia Iran and Nigeria might be included too Experts however warn that friction between China  a proponent of expansion  and the more reticent India makes the subject highly uncertainWhy this is important to the dedollarisation debate is that the speed of expansion in BRICS could well determine the speed with which this bloc adopts commercial and financial systems outside of the dollar sphere There are also suggestions that this summit could reintroduce the subject of a BRICS currencyFar from abandoning their own national currencies we presume this venture could be pursued along the lines of a new Unit of Account  similar to the IMFs Special Drawing Rights SDR For example the NDB or other commerce being conducted in BRICS could require users to hold more of these currencies and potentially gravitate away from the dollarThe link to dedollarisation here is that the creation of a BRICS unit of account could increase these currencies shares in FX reserves of BRICS users  in the same way that Chinas 2015 entry into the SDR basket was meant to increase interest in the renminbi Away from the speculation over the future of BRICS our article examines evidence of dedollarisation seen so far There are a whole host of scholarly articles on this subject and perhaps one of the best definitions of what makes an international currency is outlined in the chart below Here the function of an international currency is assessed through the prisms of both the public and private sectorsWhile we find this a useful framework to assess the extent of dedollarisation we prefer to examine the challenge to the dollars dominance through the three key areas ofLooking at the evidence so far Figure 2 it appears that despite some loss of popularity since 2015 we use this year as a frame of reference due to its similarities with current exchange rates dedollarisation has not been very active in the last couple of years Over the same time the dollars role in,15,2023-08-18,2
51,China Is No 1990s Japan - But It Could Have Been,China will probably grow by about 5 this year And for those for whom GDP growth is the only goal worth pursuing itBut let us be very clear China is not on the brink of deflation and the situation between Japan in 1990 and China today is very different Indeed there is a strong argument to support a slower less debtfuelled and in all sensesJapans answer was to do it again only larger and then again and again And that is why today they have a government debttoGDP ratio of around 263 For all the talk of stimulus plans that fills the newswires each week there is nothing wrong with China sticking to its current pathLets start with a recap of the Japan bubble The received wisdom today is that this followed a period of overaccommodative monetary policy by the Bank of Japan BoJ following the Plaza Accord after which the yen rallied prompting the BoJ to keep rates much lower than they would otherwise have done and which in turn fed an aggressive property boom and then eventual bustThat boom created a lot of paper wealth in which corporates appeared to be making large profits often just based on unrealised property gains or stock market investments while their operating profits actually dwindled Banks got sucked into this financing projects whose main criteria for success was often just the underlying land price or crossshareholding exposures And when eventually the BoJ started to respond to what it perceived as threatening inflation it popped what had evidently become a massive financial bubble which encompassed not just the property market real assets but financial assets and the banking system tooThe stock market crashed and stayed low Firms went bankrupt and insolvent banks were merged with larger more solvent ones under the socalled convoy system which meant that even previously healthy institutions were hobbled The pain was lessened but it was more widely distributed Biting the bullet on bad loans and pulling the plug on zombie companies took a very long time which also prolonged the stagnation and delayed the eventual recoveryThe economy of course contracted and remained stagnant for years Consumer price inflation turned negative and even nominal wages declined It has taken decades for the economy to pull itself out of the mire that this bubble created though it appears to be doing so nowLooking back on it the causes of the bubble and its subsequent crash are not as obvious as the convenient explanation I have just provided Policy rates were not all that low relative to inflation and the appreciation of the JPY following the Plaza Accord should have provided a substantial degree of financial tightening too Broad money growth also was not so obviously out of control at least relative to previous decades It is hard to say we would definitely avoid doing something similar again now even with the benefit of hindsightThat said there is no arguing with the carnage that followed Japan suffered a textbook case of genuine deflation  a term that is often misused experiencing widespread and deep declines in the general price level by which we mean not just consumer prices but real assets financial assets and nominal wagesSo lets take a look at what is happening in China and pick apart the deflation argument Firstly lets look for evidence of a bubble because if we are going to argue that it is about to burst it needs to be there in the first placeIn 1984 land prices for commercial property in Tokyo grew at a respectable 72 annual pace The following year this accelerated to 125 and the year after that to 482 By 1987 commercial property land prices were rising at a 611 YoY pace It was once suggested that the 15 square kilometres of land surrounding the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were worth more than all the land in California And whether or not that calculation stacks up it sounds highly questionable it shows just how extreme things had becomeYes ,8,2023-08-04,3

54,SPY: Current Correction Is Just The Beginning,I post macroeconomic articles quite frequently on Seeking Alpha but the last time I wrote specifically about the   was in  when the underlying index was atMany analysts attribute the current SPY correction to a seasonal factor If we look at the monthly performance of SPY since 1993 we see that September is the worst month of allAnd indeed there was a strong downward trend in September this year However the downward trend  and continues to this day even though both August and October are medianpositive normal monthsI dont know about you but for me personally justifying the price behavior of an asset based on its historical seasonality is not enough because the past does not explain the futureYes after three straight months of losses SPY may rise in November due to the effect of a selffulfilling prophecy if the market believes in an upswing and actively buys it But what will happen next Lets rely on the macro data and judge by the fundamentalsI already wrote about this in my last article on broad market ETFs and I repeat it here the most important thing for any economy in the world is the central bank interest rate It is always a kind of engine for economic growth the higher it is the harder it is for the economy to grow and the greater the chances of avoiding overheating Central banks balance from cycle to cycle always warming up and cooling down the economy  that is their main taskWhen the problem of high inflation arose a few years ago the overheating occurred the Fed started raising interest rates to cool the economy down again It succeeded in doing so Annual inflation in the US fell from 91 in June 2022 to 37 in August 2023Interest rates remained high to prevent inflation from rising again In turn markets began to price in the likelihood of an imminent reversal of the Feds monetary policy This led to a consensus view of good EPS growth potential against the backdrop of the about the consumers purchasing power strengthMy macro views have long contradicted the general consensus I dont believe consumer purchasing power is healthy and that cloudless SPYs EPS growth in FY2024 can somehow be justified yes even given the AI stuff Upon each review of the new data I consistently discovered indications that suggest the SPYs  for the next year is probably inflatedLets look at consumers I like to look at indirect data which includes surveys by Morgan Stanleys AlphaWise analysts Their latest survey October 2 2023  proprietary source shows that US consumer confidence has declined recently 54 now expect the economy to worsen over the next six months up from 49 the previous month while only 23 of consumers expect the economy to improve down from 30 the previous monthI assume that everything here should work as with inflation expectations When inflation expectations are high economic theory says that consumers start consuming more goods before prices rise In the case of consumer confidence everything should work in the opposite direction When consumers expect an economic downturn they begin to prepare for it by adjusting their behavior consumption and naturally reducing itAt the same time according to the same study consumers savings buffer fell from an average of 48 to 42 months That is the consumer is getting weaker not stronger as far as I can see Moreover we have another problem that cannot yet be solved the  as I call itYouve probably heard without me that equities as an asset class began to offer a very meager risk premium sometime in 2023 For comparison the stock markets earnings spread to Treasuries which by definition is the equity risk premium is now well below spreads offered by the investment grade bond market as  from  for SPY to adapt to the bond yields this high it would need to reach a level of 3900 At this point it would have the same level of risk premium as it did before the increase in bond term premium,131,2023-10-07,3

57,Our Latest Calls For Central Banks,No further rate hikes with cuts starting from Spring 2024 The Federal Reserve continues to signal the potential for a further rate hike this year given that inflation remains above target the jobs market is tight and activity has proven to be surprisingly resilient Nonetheless challenges will continue to mount with real household disposable income slowing to a crawl just as student loan repayments are restarting credit availability is drying up and pandemicera accrued savings are being exhausted for many households Encouragingly key inflation measures are looking more benign with the core A tight labour market and a US consumer that continues to spend could keep inflation higher for longer especially if unions extract inflationbusting wage agreements that set a benchmark for broader pay deals The Fed would have little hesitation in hiking further in this scenario Alternatively if financial distress reemerges in the banking sector  most likely via the commercial real estate market  this will tighten lending conditions markedly and could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates more aggressively No further rate hikes and the first rate cut in summer 2024 Official European Central Bank ECB comments since the September meeting and rate hike suggest that the ECB is not done yet with its hiking cycle However we expect the eurozone economy to weaken further and faster than the ECB currently expects Combined with more disinflation until the end of the year there will be very few arguments in favour of further rate hikes at the late October and early December meetings Once the Fed starts cutting rates and assuming eurozone inflation remains around 3 next year the ECB will be in a position to alter its monetary policy stance to one that is less restrictive but not yet accommodative A more resilient eurozone economy coupled with the impact of the recent oil price surge could easily push the ECB to opt for at least one more hike before yearend The ECB is clearly also concerned with its own inflationfighting credibility and the fear of a deanchoring of inflation expectations The ECBs very own dismal track record in predicting inflation could tilt the balance towards more hikes No more rate hikes and the first rate cuts from summer 2024The Bank of England BoE held rates steady at its September meeting and theres not a huge amount of data set to be released between now and the next decision in November which is likely to alter that calculation Barring a big spike in services inflation or wage growth we think the tightening cycle has finished The BoE has been very clear that it is prioritising keeping rates higher for longer over hiking more aggressively in the short term Still with unemployment rising its only a matter of time before wage growth starts coming down though progress is likely to be gradual Come next summer the average rate on outstanding mortgage debt is likely to have gone from 3 now to over 4 even without any more hikes That suggests a gradual ratecutting cycle can start from the middle of next year taking rates to something closer to neutral Large upside surprises to services inflation or wage growth unlocks another rate hike in November Another tweak to the Yield Curve Control YCC policy but no change in the policy rate until the second quarter of 2024 Recent data has shown inflation is proving to be more stable and sticky than expected There are signs that some of it reflects demand pressure with private service prices rising notably in recent months helped by rising tourism An additional nudge from monetary policy would also provide some support for the JPY which has been under pressure given the higher for longer market view of the Fed A change to policy interest rates will not happen earlier than we are forecasting because the Bank of Japan BoJ will need to see the outcome of the Spring Wage settlement in order to be convinced that the economy can withstan,0,2023-10-05,1
58,"Billionaire Howard Marks Says Sell Stocks, Buy Credit: Our Top Picks",Howard Marks latest   Further Thoughts on Sea Change  provides a comprehensive analysis of the current macroeconomic environment and emphasizes a potentially pivotal shift in the investment landscape In it he underscores the necessity of reevaluating traditional investment strategies particularly in the contextIn his memo Mr Marks begins by reflecting on the adage this time its different cautioning investors against the perils of rationalizing high valuations while also acknowledging that on rare occasions fundamental shifts in markets do indeed occur that warrant a reevaluation of investment strategies He goes on toWhile the Federal Reserves decision to lower the fed funds rate to zero in late 2008 and the ensuing 13year period of accommodative policies and low interest rates benefited asset owners and borrowers they also fostered complacency among asset owners and eagerness among potential buyers Moreover the subsequent Covid19 relief measures  coupled with supplychain disruptions  led to a classic inflationary scenario of too much money chasing too few goods This produced persistent inflation in 2021 and 2022 forcing the Fed to abandon its accommodative stance and raise interest rates dramatically while ending its quantitative easing QE program to the point where it is now actually engaging in quantitative tightening by letting assets roll off of its balance sheet as they maturePerhaps the most gripping part of Marks memo to me was his mention of the 2000basispoint decline in interest rates between 1980 and 2020 which he believes was largely responsible for the majority of investment profits during that period Longterm macro trends such as this fourdecade long decline in interest rates can go unnoticed yet have a profound impact on investment outcomes Moreover it is important to keep in mind that most investors alive today have only witnessed declining or ultralow interest rates and even those who were in the markets during the high interest rates and high inflation of the 1970s have been out of it for so long that it is likely that they have fallen into a bit of complacency about low interest rates as well As a result it is quite possible that the markets perception of what is considered a normal interest rate is heavily skewed towards lower levels than what has typically occurred over the course of historyAs a result Marks is skeptical  as should we all  that we are going to soon return to near zero percent interest rates and also believes that the outcome of a higher interest rate range moving forward may slow economic growth erode profit margins lead to higher business bankruptcy rates and result in less reliable asset appreciation in both the public and private marketsAs a result assumptions that investment strategies and asset classes that have boomed over the past decade or even longer may turn out to be misguidedMarks also devotes considerable space in his memo to making the case for why credit securities are likely a much better riskadjusted investment than equities at the moment As a result he believes that it may be prudent for investors to reallocate their capital accordingly particularly into highyield bondsWhile the preceding 13 years presented a bleak scenario for credit investors characterized by the lowest prospective returns across various asset classes the present environment promises higher prospective returns given that highyield bonds now yield over 8 As a result the expected pretax yields from noninvestment grade debt investments now approach or even surpass the historical returns from equity with the added advantage of being contractual returns and in some cases even secured by underlying businesses andor hard assets providing a measure of predictability and securityMoreover given that there is considerable uncertainty about the future direction of the economy it is important to note that credit investments  unlike equi,222,2023-10-16,3

Are They Right?,Economists no longer expect a recession Such was according to a recent WSJ survey of Wall Street economists The Federal Reserve also suggests the same Following the September FOMC meeting the  and upgraded its economic forecast to include a  scenarioThe problem with that optimism is that it is entirely based on lagging economic data More importantly that lagging data is subject to relatively large negative revisions in the future Furthermore as discussed previously tighter monetary policys lag effect is still working through the system As Michael Lebowitz noted Such is why the Fed and economists are always a day late and a dollar shortGiven the dependence on economic data subject to significant revisions it is unsurprising that the Fed and economists are often incorrect in their prognostications As we wrote in Of course economists are not much better Lets revisit the WSJ survey of Wall Street economists from above However this time we will note the dates that the National Bureau Of Economic Research NBER dated the beginning and end of the last two recessions While this sample size is relatively small it does reinforce the point that economists are generally wrong about a  scenario   Economic data is subject to substantive negative revisions as data gets collected and adjusted over the forthcoming 12 and 36 monthsConsider for a minute that in January 2008 Chairman Bernanke statedIn hindsight in December 2008 the NBER dated the start of the official recession in December 2007If Ben Bernanke didnt know a recession was underway how would weLets take a look at the data below of real  economic growth ratesEach of the dates above shows the economys growth rate You will note in the table above that in 7 of the last 10 recessions real GDP growth was running at 2 or aboveBut the next month one beganThe chart below shows the SP 500 with two dots The blue dots are when the recession started The yellow triangle is when the NBER dated the start of the recession Do you see the problem of the  call by economistsWhile the WSJ economists are seemingly confident in their expectation of   The table below shows the date of the market peak and real GDP versus the start of the recession and GDP growth at that timeFor exampleAs noted above during 2007 most media analysts and the economic community proclaimed there was They were wrongToday we are once again seeing many of the  Leading economic indicators inverted yield curves and the change in monetary velocity suggest the risk of a recession is elevatedThere are three lessons to be learned from this analysisWe suspect the bevy of WSJ economists will again be incorrect in their assumptionsUnfortunately we wont have that evidence until it is too late  The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editorsAfter having been in the investing world for more than 25 years from private banking and investment management to private and venture capital I have pretty much been there and done that at one point or another I am currently a partner at RIA Advisors in Houston Texas The majority of my time is spent analyzing researching and writing commentary about investing investor psychology and macroviews of the markets and the economy My thoughts are not generally mainstream and are often contrarian in nature but I try an use a common sense approach clear explanations and my real world experience in the process  I am a managing partner of RIA Pro a weekly subscriber basednewsletter that is distributed to individual and professional investors nationwide The newsletter covers economic political and market topics as they relate to your money and life  I also write a daily blog which is read by thousands nationwide from individuals to professionals at wwwrealinvestmentadvicecom ,26,2023-10-27,3

68,The Trade Desk Stock: What To Expect From Q2 Earnings?,The Trade Desk  will report Q2 2023 earnings on Wednesday Aug 9 after the market closeIn this article well look forward to those earnings What to expect and pay attention toBut before that I want to show you how TTDs stock did after some previous earnings releases This is the reaction to the Q4 and FY 2022 results for exampleAs you can see the stock was up almost a third of its market cap on a single dayAfter Q1 2023 the market reaction was moderate but its not the first time The Trade Desk had a big move after earnings After the company announced its Q1 2021 earnings the stock dropped by 25 that this wasThis also means another big stock price move is always possible after The Trade Desk has announced its earnings Forewarned is forearmed rightIf we look at the expectations this is the consensus we see for nonGAAP earnings per share based on the estimates of 18 analystsAs you can see the consensus is 026 but there is a big variation between the estimates going from 020 to 038If we look at revenue 24 analysts tried to predict The Trade Desks Q2 revenue The consensus stands at 455 million representing 207 growth yearoveryearHere the range of the estimates is narrow at just a 192 million difference between the highest and the lowest guesses That represents a 42 difference from the consensusThe Trade Desk is an outstanding performer and you can see that in the stock price performance since the IPO in 2016If you invested in the IPO of The Trade Desk you would be up 2720 Of course you can also see the big volatility of the stock which is typical for highgrowth stocksOne of the reasons is the companys great track record on earnings In 2019 stating that The Trade Desk ridicules the Wall Street Shuffle I quote from that article to explain what I meanBut by always beating the consensus sometimes by huge margins The Trade Desk ridicules this game a bit Some analysts also dont like that the company doesnt give a range for guidance but an at least formulaI made sure that the EPS beat in the last quarter can be seen With 88 it was an impressive one but if you look at The Trade Desks earnings beats its not even in the top three of the last four yearsRevenue beats are of course never that big from a percentage point of view But here too The Trade Desk has an outstanding track recordAs you can see the earnings surprise for The Trade Desk in the previous quarter was 5 Just like for the earnings the company has a great track record of beating revenue estimatesIf you look at revenue growth since 2015 you see an impressive track record not just because of the magnitude of the revenue growth but also because of the consistencyThis track record means there is a big chance The Trade Desk beats again on both EPS and revenue Well have to wait to know by how much of course and the stock price reaction can also depend on this A small beat may be perceived as negative considering the stock price return The Trade Desk has seen this year More about that later in this articleThe Trade Desk operates in a huge total addressable marketTwo fundamental shifts are going on in the ad market both of which favor The Trade DeskThe first is  As advertisers can access more data for their campaigns across multiple channels they will start prioritizing value over just the price While they will still consider the cost of buying ad space they will focus more on whether the ads delivered the desired outcome for the price paid The Trade Desks founder and CEO Jeff Green even goes as far as calling this correcting a historical mistake Impressions should never have been a measuring stick conversion should have and should beUntil now inventory was low in CTV because most streaming was subscription based Think of Netflix  That meant high CPIs cost per mille so how much 1000 impressions cost an advertiser With Netflix and other streamers adding an ad,12,2023-08-07,3
69,Economic Success - Income Inequality Continues To Grow,On Wednesday the Federal Reserve released data relating to the jump in US wealth in the period between 2019 and 2022The story in the dataAs Jeanna Smialek and Ben Casselman write in the IncomeThe reasonBecause the rich hold such a large share of financial assets in America wealth gaps tend to grow in absolute terms when stocks bonds and houses are climbing in priceTrue to that wealth climbed much more in dollar terms for rich familiesAnd what was going on during this time in terms of economic policyThis was a period of quantitative easing on the part of the Federal Reserve systemThis wasQuantitative easing was created by and originally initiated by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben BernankeQuantitative easing takes place when the Federal Reserve constantly adds securities to its securities portfolio over an extended period of timeOne can see from the chart presented above that this fourth round of quantitative easing began early in 2020 and carried on into early 2022 a period of more than 24 monthsMr Bernanke was the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 to 2014Mr Bernanke generated the new policy tool of the Federal Reserve in order to combat the Great Recession 20072009 and to generate steady economic growth in the following period of economic expansionMr Bernankes idea was for the Federal Reserve to purchase government securities in sufficient quantity and with sufficient regularity so that investors would use the funds created by the purchases to buy bonds stocks and other assets thereby generating a wealth effect that would spur on consumer spendingand economic growthMr Bernanke led the Federal Reserve through three rounds of quantitative easing during his time at the FedThe results were very satisfying to Mr Bernankeand many othersas the economy produced the longest period of economic recovery in the postWorld War II periodAnd bond prices rose stock prices rose and housing prices rosealong with other asset pricesNote Consumer price inflation remained very low for the full period of the economic expansion The compound rate of consumer price inflation was 23 percent for the entire period of economic growthHowever asset prices rose and rose and rose during this time period and as I have written about many times wealth inequality grew and grew and grew as a result of the asset price inflationWell this apparently is what happened during the period of quantitative easing under the Federal Reserve leadership of Jerome PowellNote that quantitative easing did not begin with the start date of this chart Furthermore the quantitative easing was stopped many months before this chart endedThe historical high for the SP 500 Stock Index came on January 3 2022 about two months before the Fed began its efforts of quantitative tighteningThe point is however that the SP 500 Stock Index rose right along with the Feds efforts of quantitative easingThus one part of the rise in asset prices that propelled the rise in wealth during the 20192022 periodHere is a picture of what happened to housing prices during this time periodAgain during the period of quantitative easing we see a steady increase in housing pricesAnd this picture can be duplicated many times for other assets that also experienced steady and extended periods of price increase during the 20192022 periodThis has been the basic macroeconomic story for the United States for a long time But we focus on the current timeQuantitative easing has apparently achieved what its supporters set out to achievea steadily growing economyPerhaps the economy has not grown as rapidly as some would likea compound growth rate of 22 percent seems to be very modestBut the economy has grown unemployment has remained very very low and consumer price inflationfor the most parthas been kept under controlThe only real blip in consumer price inflation came tow,6,2023-10-19,6

72,I'm Buying Norfolk Southern Stock With Both Hands,My entire investment philosophy is based on findingOnce Ive found these companies I stick to them and buy whenever the market offers opportunities which is why I started this article with a quote from the Oracle of OmahaHaving said that one of my favorite longterm investments is This Atlantabased railroad hasnt done so well latelyThe railroad is currently down 32 excluding dividends making it one of the worst selloffs since the 1980s Since the Great FinancialNonetheless despite these steep selloffs NSC is still beating the market when it comes to the total return of the past ten years which is due to its ability to rebound during economic expansionsThe company has also benefitted from its ability to improve operating efficiencies pricing power in times of elevated inflation economic reshoring and the fact that railroads are incredibly efficient which helps companies to reduce their supply chain carbon footprint and it benefits from labor tightness in trucking marketsUnfortunately most of these factors are gone  at least for the time beingEconomic growth is down a weak consumer has resulted in tremendous intermodal weakness high inflation is doing a number on operating costs and the derailment in East Palestine Ohio caused investors to doubt Norfolks safety and potential exposure to liabilitiesIn this article well discuss all of this especially as we head into the companys thirdquarter earnings release on October 25So lets get to itAs its 30 stock price decline may suggest NSC isnt doing so wellThe company is dealing with slower economic growth a related decline in consumer sentiment and sticky inflationLike all railroads NSC is highly cyclical After all when economic growth declines the need for transportation declinesNorfolk Southerns services cover 60 of consumption in the US and 50 of manufacturingThe one thing that makes Norfolk Southern special is its footprint in intermodal In 2Q23 56 of its volumes were intermodal shipments Norfolk Southern is the largest intermodal railroad behind Buffettowned BNSFHowever intermodal is a lowmargin business For example last quarter the company made roughly 4000 per chemical unit It made just 890 per intermodal unitAs a result a 56 volume share drops to a 26 share of revenuesOther railroads like CSX  Union Pacific  and the two Canadian giants have a much larger footprint in nonintermodal segments allowing them to outperform NSCYeartodate NSC is the worst performerI would even make the case that its the worst Class I railroad on the market  right nowAnd yet Im buying with both handsSee most problems are temporary and the market is doing a great job pricing in weakness allowing me to buy an attractively valued railroadBefore I get to the good news lets take a quick look backIn the second quarter a lot went wrongFor example revenue declined by 8 as the company encountered 6 lower volumes and 3 lower revenue per unit It saw declines in all segments mainly in intermodal which saw a 23 declineOn top of that it saw slightly higher costs Usually expenses tend to fall in times of a freight recession However sticky inflation and the need to hire more people for efficiency reasons limited the companys ability to cut costsAs a result operating income fell by a whopping 22 which excludes 416 million in costs related to the East Palestine cleanup The good news is that the company expects these East Palestine operations to moderate in the fourth quarter allowing it to go back to normal in 2024Due to the mix of weaker revenues and stable costs the adjusted operating ratio soared to a multiyear high of 667Bear in mind that the operating ratio measures how much the company spends on operations as a percentage of total revenues The lower this number the betterDuring the  Deutsche Bank Transportation Conference Norfolk CEO Alan Shaw commented on economic dev,22,2023-10-20,3

76,BRICS Expansion: The Saudi Surprise Adds Momentum To The De-Dollarisation Debate,By     We knew that the expansion of the BRICS grouping was top of the agenda at this 15th BRICS summit in South Africa We had thoughtThe biggest surprise is Saudi Arabia It had been rumoured that the country wanted to enter the group but the geopolitical situation  given tense relations with the West  raised doubts about whether Saudi Arabia would formalise political and economic ties with the BRICSTogether with fellow oil and gas exportersThe recently announced news that a handful of countries including Saudi Arabia the UAE and Iran have been invited to join BRICS increases the energy dominance of the group specifically when it comes to crude oil As it stands BRICS members make up around 20 of global oil output The addition of Saudi the UAE and Iran would see the BRICS group make up almost 42 of global crude oil outputAs for Saudi Arabia it is the largest crude oil exporter In 2022 the Kingdom exported around 73m bd of crude oil which makes up a little more than 17 of global crude oil exports The bulk of these exports 76 go to Asia of which 35 go to BRICS members China and IndiaTherefore given the ambitions of the BRICS to dedollarise there certainly will be increased speculation that this latest move could see Saudi Arabia increasingly switching to nondollardenominated currencies for oil trade To some it might make sense that Saudi Arabia starts accepting the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee from China and India for its crude oil And there has been plenty of noise and reportedly discussions between Saudi Arabia and China on the matter However up until now it does not appear as though the Saudis have been willing The fact that the Saudi riyal is pegged to the US dollar might mean that the Saudis are reluctant to start making the shiftHowever where we have seen a shift is obviously in relation to Iran Given sanctions any buyers of its crude will be paying in nondollar currencies China is the largest buyer of Iranian oil at the moment and is reportedly paying in yuan we speculated on which countries could join BRICS and also examined all the evidence of dedollarisation to date We concluded that dedollarisation had been very slow and that where market share had been lost by the dollar it had largely been taken by the Chinese renminbi in the Asia spaceNews of this faster expansion  especially among the oil exporters  clearly adds some momentum to the dedollarisation debate We would reiterate however that energy only comprises 15 of global trade and that Saudi pricing oil exports to China and India in nondollar currencies does not spell the end of the dollar as the international currency of choiceAs we argued the liability role of an international currency is crucially important Until international issuers and investors are happy to issue and hold international debt in nondollar currencies  and the takeup of CNY Panda bonds has been very slow indeed  we suspect this will be a decadelong progression to a multipolar world a world in which perhaps the dollar the euro and the renminbi become the dominant currencies in the Americas Europe and Asia respectivelyAway from the implications of how quickly the dollars role as the only international currency is challenged we are also interested in what this all means for the Saudi riyal which has been pegged to the dollar at SAR375USD since the 1980sAny occasional bouts of speculation against the riyal  largely through the FX forwards market  have been quickly fought off by Saudi authorities Should the Saudis start to dedollarise their economy through increasing receipts on nondollar currencies investors may start to question whether changes will be coming to the peg  eg should the riyal be managed against a basket of currencies rather than against the dollar alonePresumably Saudi authorities will not welcome this speculation but expect investors to now keep a close eye on the 12month USDSAR forwa,7,2023-08-24,2
77,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,562,2023-09-17,3

85,Passive Income: 7-13% Well-Covered Yields From The 5 Biggest BDCs,Business Development Companies or BDCs  are a great source of passive income for investors because they invest primarily in broadly diversified portfolios of senior secured debt Moreover these loans are almost entirely floating interest rate loans making them nice portfolioThe largest BDC     has a lot going for it right nowFirst of all ARCC reported a 26 yearoveryear increase in core earnings per share in Q2 which was primarily driven by the benefit of higher interestFurthermore ARCCs GAAP earnings per share for the quarter came in at 061 easily covering its dividend The quarterly dividend of 048 was also well covered by the net investment income per share of 057 during Q2 resulting in a sturdy 119x coverage ratio When combined with its significant amount of spillback income ARCCs dividend appears quite sustainable for the foreseeable futureAnother major positive for ARCC is that  despite paying out a significant dividend to shareholders  its Net Asset Value NAV per share continues to grow posting a sequential increase of 013 07 in Q2 Furthermore there was a sequential uptick in the weighted average yields on incomeproducing securities and total investments by 20 basis points reaching 122 and 110 respectively while the net interest and dividend margin also saw a 40 basis point sequential increase settling at 79On the leverage front the ratio witnessed a decline moving from 109x to 107x sequentially giving it a very solid investment grade balance sheetAdditionally nonaccruals showed sequential improvement dipping from 23 to 21 on an amortized cost basis and from 13 to 11 on a fair value basis reflecting strong underwriting performanceWith a 101 dividend yield and solid underlying fundamental performance ARCC looks like a solid bluechip BDC to own during these uncertain timesThe second largest BDC     presents a compelling investment opportunity as well for several reasonsFirst of all while its Net Asset Value per share witnessed a sequential dip in its latest quarterly report net investment income per share improved by 001 sequentially to 082 while providing a very healthy 128x coverage ratio on the regular quarterly dividend and even provided a hefty 109x coverage ratio of the total dividend of 075 which included 011 in special dividendsThe companys  also remains solid with an investment grade credit rating and 35 billion in liquidity with a pretty favorable debt maturity ladder Moreover its net debt to equity ratio declined from 118x in Q1 to 113x at the end of Q2 reflecting managements efforts to position the company to weather a potential economic downturnFurthermore FSKs underwriting quality continues to improve with a nonaccrual rate of 25 on a fair value basis as of the end of Q2 marking a sequential decline from 27 at the end of Q1 This steady improvement is primarily due to the fact that KKR Credit loans are replacing FSKs poorly underwritten legacy loans and bodes well for the BDCs future In fact as of the end of Q2 a substantial 86 of FSKs total portfolio had been underwritten by KKR Credit and these investments had a mere 06 nonaccrual rate on a fair value basis This implies that the majority of FSKs current nonaccruals originate from the residual 14 of the portfolio which continues to diminish as a percentage of FSKs portfolio as time progressesWith a dividend yield of over 13 that is well covered by earnings a solid balance sheet and improving underwriting performance FSK is positioned to deliver exceptional total returns to shareholdersThe third largest BDC     grew its net investment income by 003 per share during Q2 improving it to 048 per share marking a second consecutive quarter of record NII Moreover this growth in NII translated into additional cash distributions for shareholders with the Board approving a supplemental dividend of 007 per share for ,93,2023-08-25,8

87,Will The Fed Trigger Another Crisis Event?,As the narrative grows the risk of a  event in the economy increases Will the Fed trigger another crisis event While unknown the risk seems likely as the Feds  narrative isSuch is a question worth asking as we look back at the Feds history of previous monetary actions Such was a topic I discussed in  To witHistorically when the Fed hikes interest rates and yield curves invert someone inevitability pushes the But that is also the fallacy in the 1995 scenario the media is currently pinning its hopes on Indeed the economy did not slip into a recession however there were crisis events along the way More importantly the yield curve did not invert in 1995 However it inverted in 1998 and a recession followed roughly 24 months laterThe chart above shows that yield curve inversions occur roughly 1024 months before recognizing a recession or crisis event This is because it takes time for the  of higher borrowing costs to negatively impact the economyWhile the Fed hopes individuals will act rationally as they tighten monetary policy investors tend not to act that way But what the markets are likely missing is that we are not just talking about the Feds monetary policy decisions in isolationWe currently live in the most highly leveraged economic era in US history As of Q2 of 2023 the total measurable leverage in the economy is 97 trillion The entire economy is currently at 222 trillion so it requires 436 in debt for each 1 of economic growth Critically that level of debt has nearly doubled since 2008 when it stood at 54 trillion and the economy was roughly 16 trillion in value In other words in just 13 years the economic leverage rose from 338 per 1 of growth to 436 That massive surge in leverage was made possible by nearzero interest rates during that periodGiven the financial systems leverage the collision of debtfinanced activity with restrictive financial conditions will lead to weaker growth Historically such increases in financial conditions have always preceded recessionary onsets and crisis events Notably those events occurred at substantially lower levels of overall leverageIf we look at the annual rate of change in total system leverage versus changes in interest rates we find about a 36month lag from when rates increase to a crisis event Given that rates started to rise in 2021 such suggests the next crisis event will occur later in 2024As noted above confirmation of the timing of the next recession or crisis event in 2024 comes from the yield curve inversions Historically when yield curves invert the media proclaims a recession is coming However when it doesnt immediately manifest they assume its  We just arent there yet as the  has yet to take holdDue to the amount of stimulus injected into the economy and the stillelevated levels of money supply as a percentage of the economy the recessionary onset likely will be akin to the 2006 episodeSimply just because the collision of higher borrowing costs reduced money supply and slowing economic growth hasnt caused a crisis or recession yet doesnt mean it wontIn  we discussed how a crisis event is possible if interest rates rise the Fed tightens monetary policy or the economic recovery faltersMost importantly over the last decade the primary rationalization  Unfortunately with inflation elevated which shrinks profit margins and high interest rates valuations are likely a more significant issue than most suspectAs At the moment we dont know when the next  will arriveHowever it is only a function of time until the Feds higher for longer causes someone to push the big red button The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editorsAfter having been in the investing world for more than 25 years from private banking and investment management to private and venture capital I have pretty much been there and done that at one point or another I am currently ,8,2023-10-13,3

98,Fund Flows And Bond Yields. 2 Different Stories,While bond yields have risen sharply lately fund flows into bonds tell two very different stories We have previously written much on the recent rise in bond yields related to economic growth event risks and recessions Of course that analysis contradicts the views of Ray Dalio Bill Ackman Bill Gross and others who currently expect rates to go higher The disconnect comes down to time frames More importantly investors must understand the difference between shortterm marketdriven narratives and the longterm economic dynamics that drive interest ratesSuch is the basis for our discussion in this blogOver the last two years interest rates on Treasury bonds have risen in response to two primary factors On the short end of the Treasury curve the 1month to 2year Treasury bonds are heavily influenced by the Federal Reserves monetary policy changes As shown there is an exceedingly high correlation between the Fed funds rate and the 2year TreasuryHowever the longend of the yield curve 10year Treasury bonds or longer are driven almost entirely by expectations for economic growth inflation and wages as shown above Notably the correlation is very highOf course there are periods where interest rates can and do diverge from the underlying economic fundamentals We are experiencing one of those periodsdriving the view that As we have discussed the Commitment Of Traders COT report gives us some insights into what major fund managers hedge funds and commodity traders are doing Given that yields on bonds are solely a function of the changes in price relative to its coupon differences in yield can be influenced by marketdriven actions in the short termThe most recent COT report currently shows a record number of short positions against Treasury bonds That selling pressure has pushed prices lower and yields higher as shown below We saw a similar episode during the  in 2018Notably when something those heavily  Treasury bond traders will be forced to cover those speculative positions In 2018 the reversal of those speculative short positions on bonds was caused to cover as the Federal Reserve stepped in with a massive program to bail out hedge fundsAs noted by  recentlyOf course while rates rise and speculative traders short bonds you might think no one is buying bondsHowever you would be wrongWhile speculators potentially drive higher yields in the short term pay attention to fund flows Two pieces of evidence suggest that rising yields arent a function of a lack of buyers The first is the US Dollar indexLast year there was a significant concern about a collapse in the US dollar as  would cause the loss of the reserve currency status As both Michael Lebowitz and I discussed at the time such would not be the case This backdrop for the dollar is not changing anytime soon According to the IMF the dollar makes up almost 60 of global foreign exchange reserves While the percentage has declined by about 10 over the last decade it is still three times the next leading reserve the Euro which accounts for about 20 of global reserves Not surprisingly as the US economy is more robust than its counterparts and the yield on the 10year Treasury bond is substantially higher foreign excess reserves are now flowing into the US DollarWhen reserves flow into the US dollar those dollars are converted into US Treasury Bonds Such is why inflows into Treasuries continue to grow despite traders record shortposition in Treasury bonds As shown the volume of fund flows into bonds is the highest since the 2020 economic shutdownWhile interest rates have stayed elevated investors have turned to longerterm funds As noted by Morning StarFor investors the current rise in yields has undoubtedly been concerning That rise coinciding with much media spin about the  and  certainly fueled the fears of spiraling interest ratesHowever when we  the fund flows suggest a differen,7,2023-10-06,3

101,Growth And Inflation Update: Not Much To Worry About,The big news this weekthough widely anticipatedwas the 49 annualized growth of the economy in the third quarter Analysts still infected by Phillips Curve thinking worried that a strong economy would encourage the Fed to keep rates higher for longer thus posingChart 1While 49 growth in one quarter certainly stands out as a big number its worth noting that its an annualized number In fact the economy reportedly grew only 12 in the third quarter And as Chart 1 shows the path of real GDP blue line experienced only a small wiggle to the upside with this latest number The big story with GDP is that the economy has been growing by more or less 22 since mid2009 Thats a lot slower than the 31 trend which prevailed from 1965 through 2007 Today the US economy is unfortunately not in danger of growing too fast It is just muddling along fighting the headwinds of very high tax and regulatory burdens aggravated by excessive government spending on transfer payments and green energy boondoggles green energy needs subsidies to compete since its woefully inefficientChart 2Chart 2 shows the yearoveryear change in the GDP deflator which is the broadest measure of inflation we have By this measure inflation has fallen from a high of 77 to now 32Chart 3Chart 3 shows the 6mo annualized rate of change of the Personal Expenditures Consumption Deflator and its core exfood and energy version note the PCE deflator is a better measure of inflation than the CPI because the weights of its components change dynamically as consumer habits change Over the past six months both of these measures show inflation rising at a 28  32 annual rate only about 1 percentage point faster than the upper end of Feds targetChart 4Chart 4 breaks down the Personal Consumption Deflator into its 3 main categories Note the impressive decline in durable goods prices which began in 1995 the year China first opened its economy to world trade Most of the increase in inflation in recent decades comes from the service sector which in turn reflects mostly wages The huge increase in wages alongside a significant decline in durable goods prices means that an hours worth of work today buys more than 3 times as much in the way of durable goods as it did in 1995 Weve never before seen such an increase in purchasing power prior to 1995 durable goods prices never declined on a multiyear basisChart 5Chart 5 shows real and nominal yields on 5yr Treasuries and the difference between the two green line which is the markets expectation for what CPI inflation will average over the next 5 years The rise in yields over the past 18 months has been driven almost exclusively by the rise in real interest rates Real rates in turn are the best measure of how tight monetary policy is Thus tight money as measured by a 340 bps rise in real yields has brought inflation expectations down to about 23 which is almost exactly the upper bound of the Feds target for PCE inflation 2 because the CPI tends to exceed the PCE deflator by about 3040 bps per yearChart 6Chart  6 compares the level of real yields on 5yr TIPS to the 2yr annualized growth of GDP which I use because it smooths out the random quarterly variations in actual GDP growth and it likely mimics the publics perception of what current GDP growth is Real yields tend to track the strength or weakness of the economy high real yields prevailed in the late 1990s when the economy was exceptionally strong growth rates of 45 and real yields have been low during most of the past decade as the economy has averaged 2 annual growth With the exception of the past 18 months of course when real yields have surged If the economy remains on a 22 growth path it wouldnt be unreasonable to expect that real yields will decline significantly from todays 24 levels That would likely coincide with a relaxation of the Feds monetary stance and,11,2023-10-29,3

103,The Market Is Detached From The Real Economy,Such is the latest rationalization to support the  narrative The question however is the validity of the statement During the 2020 economic shutdown and surging market rebound I statedOf course as we now know the market ran well ahead of economic growth and in 2022 much of the market declined to realign with economic realities Such should be unsurprising given the close relationship between the economy earnings and asset prices over time The chart below compares the three going back to 1947 with an estimate for 2023 using the latest data pointsSince 1947 earnings per share have grownHowever after a decade many investors became complacent in expecting elevated rates of return from the financial markets In other words the abnormally high returns created by massive doses of liquidity became seemingly ordinary As such it is unsurprising that investors developed many rationalizations to justify overpaying for assetsWhen it comes to the state of the market corporate profits are the best indicator of economic strengthBut as has always been the case the markets can certainly seem to However such detachments never last indefinitelyAs shown when we look at inflationadjusted profit margins as a percentage of inflationadjusted GDP we see a process of meanreverting activity over time Such should not be surprising as asset prices should eventually reflect the underlying reality of corporate profitability which are a function of economic activityMore importantly corporate profit margins have physical constraints Out of each dollar of revenue created there are costs such as infrastructure RD wages etc One of the biggest beneficiaries of expanding profit margins has been the suppression of employment wage growth and artificially low borrowing costs The chart below measures the cumulative change in the SP 500 index compared to corporate profits Again we find that when investors pay more than 1 for 1 worth of profits those excesses are reversedThe correlation is more evident in the market versus the pricetocorporate profits ratio  Hence neither should the impending reversion in both seriesTo this point it has seemed to be a simple formula It remains a hard point to argueThis should not surprise anyone as asset prices eventually reflect the underlying reality of corporate profitability and economic growthWithout those fiscal and monetary supports economic growth should return to previous growth trends of sub2 due to increased debts and deficitsLook at the chart below which compares the total monetary and fiscal interventions to economic growth The market disconnect from underlying economic activity over the last decade was due almost solely to successive monetary interventions leading investors to believe The chart below shows the cumulative total of those interventions that provided the illusion of organic economic growthOver the next decade the ability to replicate 10 of interventions for each 1 of economic seems much less probable Of course one must also consider the drag on future returns from the excessive debt accumulated since the financial crisis That debts sustainability depends on lowinterest rates which can only exist in a lowgrowth lowinflation environment Low inflation and a slowgrowth economy do not support excess return ratesHowever it is common for the market to become detached from the underlying economic activity for long periods as speculative excess detaches the market from underlying fundamental realities Such is clearly shown in the chart below which compares the stock market to GDP on an inflationadjusted basis In all cases market excesses eventually mean revert The only issue is the catalyst that causes itIt is hard to fathom how forward return rates will not be disappointing compared to the last decade However we must remember those excess returns resulted from a monetary illusion The consequence of dispelling that illusi,59,2023-10-12,3
104,Devon Energy: The Path To A 10% Yield And 100% Total Return,Its time to talk about  one of my favorite oil and gas plays In the past few weeks Ive increased my coverage of upstream energy companies again giving Another stock Ive given a  rating is Devon Energy a company Ive had on my radar since I started covering oil and gas in more depthNot only is this a company people have kept bringing up in the past few weeks but it is also one of the best US onshore oil and gas playsSince I wrote an  titled  in July the stock has risen 82 beating the market by 800 basisEven better the bull case has gotten stronger Despite ongoing economic weakness oil has continued its uptrend reaching highly favorable prices for accelerating dividend payoutsOn top of that DVN has reported  showing a path to higher production without having to sacrifice shareholder distributionsIn this article Ill update my bull case using new developments and explain why DVN remains a great spot for incomeoriented investors who do not want to sacrifice upside potential in a rising oil environmentSo lets get toAs most readers may be aware economic growth is not in a great spot Consumer sentiment is poor manufacturing and service expectations have taken a hit and indicators like temporary work are hinting at elevated recession oddsOil which is a highly cyclical commodity doesnt seem to careLooking at the chart below we see that NYMEX WTI crude oil is back at 86This is more than 30 above this years lows and roughly 18 above 2018 peak levels This is fantastic news for oil companiesAs Ive explained in almost every single energyfocused article since 2020 were dealing with a shift in oil and gas fundamentalsIf this were a  environment for oil and gas I believe that oil would be at least 20 lowerHowever its not a normal situation Unconventional oil production in the United States used to be the driver of global supply growth Thats overThe only main driver of onshore supply growth is the Permian which is expected to see peak production in the fourth quarter of next yearOn top of that Permian drillers have already started to temporarily reduce output to deal with market uncertaintyThe number of rigs in the Permian recently fell at the fastest pace in three yearsAs reported by OPEC is doing the same Saudi Arabias push to protect 80 Brent we can assume that this is its target and related cuts have resulted in very subdued OPEC productionOPEC knows it has more pricing power because of slower production in the United States Its not afraid to use its pricing power as were currently finding out the hard way  looking at gasoline pricesMeanwhile oil demand is breaking out hitting new postpandemic highsWhile I do not rule out temporary corrections in oil given the poor state of the economy I believe the longterm trend is upI also expect tripledigit dollar oil prices the moment economic growth expectations bottomIf oil is at 86 with subdued demand in most developed nations imagine what it can do if demand is strongerThis brings me to DevonEnergy in general is a great place to be for incomeoriented investorsHowever there are significant differences between energy industriesInvestors who want income with limited commodity price risks are better off buying midstream companies The same goes for downstream companies which turn oil into valueadded products These companies are dependent on the spread between input oil and output gasoline prices Im obviously painting with a broad brush here but I think you get the ideaUpstream companies are the most volatile companies as they are highly dependent on oil pricesWhile this may make some players poor longterm investments they are the best place to be when betting on higher oil pricesIn this case I prefer players with deep reserves given that were seeing shale players run out of Tier 1 production low breakeven prices healthy balance sheets and the related ability and willingness t,65,2023-08-06,5

106,A Bond Market Rally Is Coming,Yesterday stocks fell sharply in response to another increase in longterm Treasury yields with the 10year breaching 48 I equate this bond selloff to the kind of panic you might see in a movie theater if someone yelled fire The yield onFor example the consensus expected job openings to fall from 882 million in July to 875 million in August Instead openings  to 961 million with most of the increase coming from professional and business services Upon release of this report yesterday at 10 am yields soared and stocks plunged as though it guaranteed the wellentrenched disinflationary trend would stall We have had an extraordinarily high number of job openings all year long but that is only relevant as it relates to job creation and wage growth which are primary drivers of inflationJob openings do not necessarily fuel inflation It is the addition of new jobs to the workforce that can increase the demand for goods and services and place upward pressure on prices Despite the number of openings job growth has slowed dramatically over the past year and fallen to just 150000 on average over the past three months If stubbornly high job openings are not leading to the creation of more jobs then Fed officials and investors need to downplay the importance of that datapoint as a reason to maintain rates higher for longerAdditionally related data calls into question the accuracy of the JOLTS report The latest seasonal job postings report from Indeed showed that for the first time since the pandemic the seasonal job postings we see around this time of year have fallen below prepandemic levels Postings today are down 3 from the same time of year in 2019 That is not a disaster but it is clearly not exhibiting the kind of strength that Fed officials and investors seem to think exists from the JOLTS report This is not a reason to remain higher for longerWhile an elevated level of job openings can put upward pressure on wages the incoming data on wage growth proves otherwise Despite 96 million job openings wage growth has steadily declined from its peak in 2021 These datapoints are all consistent with a soft landing which is a balance between economic strength and weakness Unfortunately there are lots of naysayers who seem to be rooting for a recession and another bear market They either inaccurately forecasted both more than a year ago and dont want to be proven wrong or they are in very liquid positions and want to profit from the corresponding declines in risk assets that come with recessions and bear marketsThe obsession with higher for longer rates really has no solid ground to stand on The Fed has largely accomplished its goal of achieving stable prices Its failure to acknowledge such is intended to keep inflation expectations in check until official reports reflect that the Fed has met its numerical target of 2 Excluding rent the August consumer price index rose an annualized 19 and the core rate rose 22 Anyone can look at the new rental rates each month that are working their way into the annualized number and discern that the headline and core inflation numbers will be at the Feds 2 target within the next 69 months Fed officials who argue otherwise are playing word games to manage inflation expectations and prevent financial conditions from loosening too soonWe are likely to be close to the peak in longterm rates  points out that Treasury market volatility has reached 2standard deviations to the downside with a decline of 164 based on the past 100 days of trading As the chart below shows every time we saw similar declines dating back to 2003 there was a reversal over the subsequent 100day period The yearend rally in stocks should start when longterm bond yields stabilizeThe major market averages are deeply oversold and due for a bounce I still believe we will see a sizeable fourthquarter rally that restores the gains we made just two months ago and upcomi,7,2023-09-20,1
107,Why Holding About 50% In Cash Equivalents Makes Sense For Investors Right Now,Recessions and bear markets will occur as long as free markets exist Pretending they dont exist or dont matter is not a good way to get betterthanaverage investment returns And those investors who ignore the possibility of long bearHere is how my cash position has progressedAt the beginning of 2022 after being nearly fully investedAt the beginning of this year I thought investors should be prepared for a 30 decline in the SP 500 Here is how the SP 500 ETF  and the Equal Weighted SP 500 ETF  have performed so far this yearAs you can see neither one of them is down 30 even though there is a big divergence between the returns of the two In this article I explain why I have roughly maintained my overall cash positioning this year I still have about a 45 cash equivalent position in my individual accounts and about a 60 cash equivalent position in my 401k I also explain why I think it is wise for most investors to have somewhere between 40 and 60 in cash right nowBefore we get into the likely reasons why the SP 500 has rallied this year its important to point out that bear market rallies are normal and in my opinion we are still in a bear marketThe above chart is of total returns since January 1st 2022 It is important to keep in mind that in the US we have had about 12 inflation during this time as well so in terms of actual purchasing power we need to subtract about 12 more from the displayed returns above The worst performer by far has been longduration government bonds which have lost half their purchasing power in two years These are often pitched as safe to investors or ballasts for portfolios The best thing investors could have done is avoid these at all costs over the past several years Even though the percentage decline in value isnt as bad over this period as Cathy Woods utterly dismal Ark Innovation Fund  the magnitude of losses in government bonds is probably in the hundreds of billions which dwarfs ARKK in terms of total value lost and I dont think even the most gullible investors ever though ARKK was safe Even if the value of these bonds ultimately recovers over the next two decades its hard to imagine how inflation doesnt eat away at least half of the purchasing powerNext we see that Vanguards Balanced Index Fund  which is what I use as a 6040 portfolio proxy is down 11 Even the mighty  and the everpopular Dividend ETF  remain in a bear market Only my preferred cash equivalent  has produced a positive return since January 2022 with a 6 return which is still about 6 less than inflation but its at least close and in 2023 TFLOs return has surpassed that of inflationOverall my individual portfolios are down about 6 over this period even though Ive been consistently adding growth stocks while maintaining about a 45 TFLO weighting So my overall defensive positioning hasnt caused me to suffer much since 2022 relative to QQQ and SPY even with the bear market rally we have seen this yearI think there are four main reasons SPY has rallied this year relative to the equalweighted RSP The first is that student loan repayments were successfully delayed by the Biden Administration for nearly two years until they finally resumed this month These repayments will be a huge drag on the economy and dramatically increase the odds of a recession each month as time goes on as this money is sucked out of the economyThe second reason is there is a mismatch between shortterm interest rates and rates that people and businesses were able to lock in for the long term when rates were very low So what has happened so far is investors in shortduration treasuries money markets and CDs are now collecting about 5 interest but those people like myself with a sub3 fixed mortgage or even people with 4 longterm fixed auto loan which can now be as long as 6 or 7 years are not paying higher rates yet In the short term as a commen,74,2023-10-04,8
108,The Most Potentially Dangerous Time The World Has Seen In Decades,I have been increasingly critical in my writings this year of the overwhelmingly negative take on just about everything related to the economy and markets There has been relentless focus on a recession that never materialized constant calls for a retestId be concerned about such a dire warning but Dimon has a history of hyperbole He  one year ago as the bear market bottomed that this is serious in reference to runaway inflation rising interest rates quantitative tightening and Russias war with Ukraine He also said the economy was likely to tip into recession in six to nine months with the SP 500 having downside of another 20 One year later three of our largest banks saw profits soar 34 to a combined record of 225 billion which was their best third quarter in history Can you imagine the results if things get less serious Positive rates of change from what was very bad to what is not as bad have been my base case for the past year fueling my optimismLeading the charge in what has been less bad is the rate of inflation which we learned last week continues to decelerate despite the hawks looking for components of the index that may not cooperate from one month to the next The rate of inflation has fallen from 82 to 37 over the past year If we exclude shelter costs which are uniquely calculated with a tremendous lag the rate has fallen to the Feds 2 target This has been a hugely positive rate of change which explains the bull market run for stocks alongside it It also strongly suggests that shortterm rates have peaked with rate cuts coming in 2024 which would be another positive rate of changeThe primary headwind to affect this positive rate of change has been the tightening of financial conditions by the Federal Reserve which resulted in higher interest rates and less market liquidity That has weighed on valuations which is why the recovery in the average stock has been well below what we typically see during the first year of a bull marketDespite lower rates of inflation and continued economic growth the equalweighted SP 500 index average stock has only returned 11 over the past 12 months while smallcap stocks have returned just 5 This is an opportunity as interest rates peak and participation broadens with improving breadth Companies aggressively cut costs and improved operational efficiencies to battle the surge in inflation from 2021 to 2022 That should now be paying dividends as the rate of inflation falls and earnings growth is restoredWith earnings season having started last week it is looking very likely that we have returned to yearoveryear profit growth The consensus estimate at the end of the third quarter was to see SP 500 earnings decline 03 which would be a large improvement from the 41 decline in the second quarter According to data aggregator  the 32 constituents of the index that have already reported beat estimates by an average of 101 That moves the consensus estimate for the overall index from a decline in earnings to growth of 04 This is a very good sign albeit early that profits are now a tailwind for the stock marketIn no way am I trying to diminish the importance of the ongoing conflict in Israel the leadership vacuum that exists in the House of Representatives or any of the other geopolitical and economic headwinds we face today There are always headwinds but this is hardly one of the most dangerous or difficult times we have faced as investors I think the tailwinds are growing stronger which is why I continue to see a soft landing in 2024 and a continuation of the bull market that started one year agoLots of services offer investment ideas but few offer a comprehensive topdown investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense That is how  compliments other services that focus on the bottomups security analysis of REITs CEFs ETFs dividendpaying stocks and o,234,2023-10-12,3
109,Inflation's Second Wave: Are We Really Watching A '70s Rerun?,Inflation has only been falling for a matter of months across majorHuge government deficits in the 1970s may not have caused the initial inflation spike but they undoubtedly amplified it So too did the massive interventions at the start of the Covid pandemic and the excess savings pile they helped createThese charts are largely nonsense the past is not a perfect gauge for the future especially given the second 1970s wave can be traced back to another huge oilRewind 50 years and not only did inflation fail to return to prior lows in either the US or the UK after the initial 1974 spike but both countries saw at least one additional spike over subsequent years Germany fared better but wages did respond to the second oil crisis helping to push inflation up againThe lesson was that for a second wave to really take off you need a catalyst and an economic environment ripe for inflation to take holdThe twin oil price shocks in the 1970s fell on a US economy that was already running hot a byproduct of persistent US trade and fiscal deficits that grew through the 1960s aided by the often loose monetary policy of thenFederal Reserve Chair Arthur Burns That excess demand helped end the Bretton Woods system of fixed currencies and the US dollar lost a quarter of its value between 1970 and mid1973 as the agreement collapsed amplifying the hit from higher energy costs And all of this fell upon an economy that was much more manufacturingcentric than it is today and it was also heavily unionised Wage growth typically kept pace with inflationBack to today the economy looks very different But we think there are valuable lessons and these are our main conclusionsEnergy must be the starting point when thinking about a second wave Our base case sees oil edging higher this year and the risk is that we continue to see a lack of investment in upstream production while demand continues to move higher That would point to an increasingly tight oil balance in the years ahead Stricter legislation on new US oilgas drilling though unlikely would be a key source of upside risk given America has been a major driver of supply growth over the last decade That aside though the US is largely energyindependent and that makes it far less exposed to 1970sstyle shocksEurope is more vulnerable though the situation is evolving National gas reserves are currently well filled and the eurozone looks better prepared to enter the winter heating season Russian gas exports to Europe are marginal now so any further supply cuts would be unlikely to take us back to 2022 highsWed also argue that natural gas demand has peaked and suspect it will be gradually lower over the next decade  the blocs flagship energy strategy puts emphasis on moving aggressively towards renewables At the same time last winters price spike appears to have resulted in a permanent demand loss in energyintensive industriesStill in the short to medium term the continent is more reliant on liquefied natural gas LNG The combination of strike action at Australian producers and a colderthanusual European winter could prompt a significant price response So too would any disruption to Norwegian natural gas supplyFor inflation though remember that in Europe electricitygas prices are still more than 50 higher than they were in 2021 in Germany and roughly double in the UK according to CPI data Even if we got another 2022style shock to wholesale prices arithmetically the scope for a similar shock to inflation at this point is more limitedMetals are another obvious vulnerability in the global economy particularly those linked to the green transition Scarcity due to a lack of production capacity andor geopolitics are important risksThe challenges in scaling up the production of electric vehicle batteries are a good example as we highlighted in a  Nickelbased batteries currently favoured for their superior driving range not only face c,30,2023-10-16,1
110,Surging Oil Prices: A New Concern For Central Banks,Surging oil prices have become the new concern for central banks aggravating the current trilemma How to balance slowing economies still toohigh inflation and the delayed impact of unprecedented rate hikes Interestingly theLooking ahead the recent surge in oil prices will make things even more complicated as it will both worsen the economic slowdown but also push up inflation or at least reduce the disinflationary trend Balancing growth and inflation will become even harder and future interest rate decisions will not only be determined by these two variables but also by central banks credibilityIn this regard central banks are most concerned about their credibility and the longerterm impact on inflation expectations could end up continuing to hike interestOil prices are currently up by more than 25 this quarter and briefly reached 95 USDb last week Our commodities analyst Warren Patterson expects  as supply cuts by OPEC countries more than offset weaker demand due to the global economys slowdownHowever he doesnt see oil prices remaining above 100 USDb for long as weaker demand and political pressure to increase supply should help to bring oil prices back to levels slightly above 90 USDbA few weeks ago we argued that the  and that a second inflation wave looked highly unlikely However we also admitted that in the late 1970s the second energy crisis was a main driver for the second inflation wave in many countriesIn the eurozone there were three peak periods for inflation in the 1970s The first was in 1974 when headline inflation was close to 14 the second in 1977 with headline inflation above 10 and then again in late 1979 and early 1980 with headline inflation back at doubledigit levelsBack then real wage growth remained positive even during the spikes of the oil crises which allowed inflation to remain above 7 for more than a decade 197284 Indeed the countries that experienced higher real wage growth for the period also experienced the highest inflation over this period see chart belowThe current surge in inflation is different in that real wage growth turned negative quickly which has slowed consumer demand drastically This makes the chances of a prolonged second spike in inflation much smaller With inflation currently trending down and wage growth stabilising above 4 real wage growth is set to soon turn positive again but we wouldnt expect it to erase the losses from the past two yearsAt the same time it is important to note that government support and employment growth have limited disposable income losses quite substantiallyDespite this not being the 1970s expectations of further disinflation will be impacted by higher oil prices This could result in a slower decline of inflation to 2 Given that our expectations for oil prices do include a drop in the first half of 2024 again the effect on our own forecast is rather moderate Plus a smaller decline in energy prices has materialised this year compared to expectations which impacts next years base effectsAssuming oil prices stay at 95 USDb for all of 2024 however the headline figure would rise by 03pp next year with a peak of the energy price contribution of 1ppt in the second quarter At the same time higher oil prices would probably further dent consumer confidence and spending thereby contributing to the current disinflationary trend due to weaker demandIndeed the big question is whether the higher oil price will once again result in broadbased secondround effects like we saw last year A lot of drivers of core inflation are at this point still disinflationary with manufacturing businesses still indicating that input costs are falling despite higher wages and energy prices And as new orders are weakening deflation for nonenergy industrial goods is realistic towards the end of the year For services weaker demand is also contributing to slowing inflation despite higher wage costs acco,4,2023-08-30,1
111,Why Markets Were Thoroughly Confused After Fed Chair Powell's Key Speech,Fed watchers who analyzed Fed Chair Jerome Powells speech at the Economic Club of New York are likely confused Powells prepared remarks provided a mix of contradictory views on the Feds policy tightening His remarks both implied the potential endThe unclear messaging created market confusion conditions that suit traders the most The Dow Jones Nasdaq and SP 500 all broke below their trading range by noon on Oct 19 Importantly the smallcap index Russell 2000  resumed its steep downtrend that began in July Smallcap firms are the most sensitive forward indicators for the stock marketHow should readers interpret Powells mixed commentary Not much has changed in the Fed policy stance since the Fed Chairs gamechanging  InPowell said that the economy might not have experienced the full impact of the central banks policy tightening While recognizing the very resilient economy interest rates do not negatively affect all sectors Later he  as expected sees the effects of higher ratesThe Chair recognizes that the magnitude of the impact of tightening does not have precision The Fed does not know how long the lags between tightening and the impact on the economy would takePowell explained that the Fed focuses on shortterm rates in its monetary policy It will need to let longterm Treasury yields play out On the day the mid to longterm Treasuries traded above the 52week high  Market Data on the toolbar and then select bondsExpect heightened bond yield volatility next Market participants previously waited for the 10year Treasury break out above 50 This is an expected  As the demand for Treasury securities weakens find the  yields will continue to climb 55 to 60 is the next milestone for the 10year yieldIn response the mortgage market already prints  This is a fixed rate not seen in 23 yearsPowell said that inflation risks could resurge Evidence that suggests persistently abovetrend growth would warrant further tightening of monetary policy In addition if tightness in the labor market stops easing it is another risk that supports a restrictive rate policyThe Fed is firm on its commitment to achieve inflation of 20 In the Sep 2023 Consumer Price Index report the  is above the 20 targetMuch to the frustration of income investors the Federal Reserve will carry out its rate policy carefully Interest rates will remain higher for much longer than markets expect REIT investors who bet on a pivot rate cut in the summer paid a heavy price Realty Income  for example tried to break out in July By September the stock fell from 5456 to a low of 4842 Its attractive dividend rose again as shares fell Its dividend yields 618The  the rate at which monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth Hutchens Center reported that this declined by around 34 since 1972 However the Fed did not offer to estimate where the neutral rate standsSince the Fed thinks the neutral rate is currently not tight That is interest rates are not above the neutral rate and therefore do not have a contractionary impact on the economy Despite the rate hikes the loose monetary policy still has a stimulatory impact on the economy By stimulating economic activity inflationary pressures will persistPowell echoed what readers said for months about the excesses of government spending Powell said that the fiscal deficit is on an unsustainable path The Fed inferred that high longterm treasury yields would weaken the governments fiscal spendingSpending on defence gets plenty of attention The Department of Defense has a  When the cost of interest on debt exceeds the defence budget the public will shift its focus on cutting the countrys debt The Treasury Department paid a record  in the last quarter of 2022Markets rewarded patient investors exposed to the defence sector Stocks like Lockheed Martin  and Northrop Grumman  are up sharply in the last monthN,3,2023-09-26,2

113,Ukraine Aid: U.S. Deficits And Debt Exploding Higher,With US Treasury bond yields rising dramatically in recent weeks there is an increasing level of concern expressed in the financial news media about sharply rising US fiscal deficits and debt Many investors and at least oneSince Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 19 months ago  the US federal governmentBased on recent appropriations packages as well as independent estimates the annual rate of future spending on Ukraine can probably be expected to be greater than it was in the past 19 months  of Ukraine expenditures for Fiscal Year FY 2024 range between 70 to 100 billion per yearNow lets see how this is impacting US fiscal deficits and debtBased on  CBO projections we estimate that total spending by the US Federal government is projected to be approximately 6818 trillion in fiscal year FY 2024 which amounts to approximately 2452 of US GDP Approximately 4848 of this amount is projected to be financed with federal revenues leaving a projected budged deficit of roughly 1970 trillion in FY 2024 Assuming belowtrend real economic growth of 0 and expenditure growth in line with inflation we project the US federal deficit to be approximately 708 for FY 2024 This is similar to the Congressional Budget Offices CBO revised and adjusted estimate of a US fiscal deficit of approximately 7 of GDP for fullyear FY 2023  estimates the US fiscal deficit for FY 2024 at 66 of GDPA  of total US spending on international security including Defense Department State Department USAID Foreign Intelligence Agencies Nuclear Defense Veteran Affairs and others is about 1 trillion per year not counting the corresponding share of interest payments generated by international security expendituresFigure 1 puts the magnitude of Ukraine spending in perspective relative to the USs total international security spending total US spending the US fiscal deficit and US GDP For these estimates we use the projected midpoint of projected Ukraine spending of 70100 billionFrom the above figures we can see that hypothetically cutting off all spending to Ukraine  even if this did not cause countervailing costs  would lower total US Federal spending by approximately 125 and would lower the projected US fiscal deficit in FY 2024 from 708 of GDP to 678 of GDPAs can be seen from above the US has a very serious fiscal problem A deficit of 7 of GDP at a time of full employment US unemployment is actually below estimate of full employment is unprecedented in US history since WWII US Federal expenditures are currently over 40 higher than its revenues Closing this fiscal budgetary gap to sustainable levels will require some combination of deep expenditure cuts and large tax increasesHowever one thing that is clear from the analysis above that Ukraine spending is  a significant aspect of the USs fiscal problems The savings that could be achieved by cutting off all Ukraine spending  ie lowering total US federal spending by 125 and lowering the total US deficit as a percent of GDP by 030  would not make a significant difference to the USs fiscal deficit or debt situationIn this context it should be clear that Ukraine spending should play virtually no role in debates about the USs fiscal problems In our view highlighting Ukraine spending in any discussion of US fiscal problems or citing fiscal US fiscal problems as a reason to not support Ukraine are classic examples of dishonest andor uninformed demagoguery Debates about the USs fiscal problems need to be focused on the real causes of those problemsSpending US taxpayer resources on helping Ukraine  be an actual problem but not a fiscal problemAmericans should certainly engage in a healthy political debate on whether and to what degree the US government should spend taxpayer money to support Ukraines defense of its national sovereignty and territorial integrityIn this context the question driving such debates should ,2,2023-08-31,2

116,Depression Alert: Why The Shrinking Money Supply Spells Trouble For SPY,The US economy is currently experiencing a rare event that hasnt been witnessed since 1949 a shrinking money supply M2 has declined by a whopping 700 billion since the hiking cycle began This phenomenon is In this article we will explore why the US money supply is shrinking and delve into its potentially negative implications for SPY and the broader financial landscapeThe recent contraction in the US money supply is not solely due to a single isolated cause Rather it is a result of a complex interplay of factors that have evolved over time including changes in Federal Reserve policy rising interest rates financial innovations and shifts in market dynamicsWe will discuss the three most prominent of these factors below One significant contributor to the shrinking money supply is the change in Federal Reserve policy away from quantitative easing and towards quantitative tightening The Fed has been reducing its massive 8 trillion balance sheet so far to the tune of 800 billion which in turn has had a direct impact on savings deposits because as the Fed rolls off assets like Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities as they reach maturity it reduces the money supply since these assets instead need to be financed by bank deposits or other forms of money Additionally rising interest rates  which have pushed yields higher in numerous financial products such as money markets  have discouraged individuals and institutions from keeping their funds in lowyield savings and checking accounts leading to a decline in deposits Moreover the continued growth in credit and debit card adoption by consumers has reduced the reliance on physical cash for everyday transactions while the years of ultralow interest rates the growing digitization of financial markets and the rise of userfriendly commissionfree trading apps like Robinhood  have made it easier and more attractive for households to allocate their savings to investments rather than traditional bank deposits Yes interest rates have risen recently but many individuals have already been activated as investors and have formed the habit of allocating excess savings to stocks rather than to a bank savings accountThese three major factors have led to a staggering 24 trillion decline in savings deposits since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in early 2022So what does the shrinking US money supply mean for SPY The reality is quite nuancedOne of the most accurate ways of measuring the relationship between the money supply and SPY performance is its impact on interest rates though the relationship between interest rates and stock market performance is complex Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixedincome assets more attractive relative to stocks As investors seek higher yields in bonds there might be a shift away from equities like those in SPY thereby hurting its performance We have seen this dynamic at play recently as surging bond yields have weighed on SPYs performanceConversely when interest rates are very low investors seeking returns are inclined to invest in riskier assets like stocks driving their prices higher due to increased demand This was one of the main reasons why SPY boomed over the decade between 2012 and 2021 especially in the aftermath of the COVID19 outbreakAnother reason why interest rates have an impact on SPY is that  when market interest rates rise  it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money for profitable projects leading to higher interest payments and lower profits In some cases projects may become unfeasible Lower profits translate to lower stock prices because stock prices are a reflection of a companys future earnings Conversely when interest rates fall companies can borrow more easily boosting profits and economic growth A classic recent example of this was seen at NextEra Energy Partners  where management just  its target growth rate in ha,55,2023-10-10,3

120,China Is Precariously Sliding Into A Lost Decade,Staunch critics of Chinas development model have been skeptical of the countrys rise as an economic superpower for many years and for various reasons However repeated warnings of an impending economic crisis never materialised until the pandemic andFor a period of time investors seemed overly accommodative to negative developments in China and would downplay risks so long as there was still immense potential in the economy Chinas sheer population size increasingly affluent middle class rapidly modernizing economy and technological progress have only made it easier for investors to cast aside any doubts over its seemingly unstoppable rise to powerWhen weOne can either take an optimists view and treat negative events as uncertainties that could potentially delay Chinas inevitable rise Or one can take a pessimists view and treat the same negative events as evidence that the country is potentially on a path to failure We are increasingly leaning towards the latterMany economists are also increasingly convinced that China is precariously sliding into economic stagnation A quick search on Google for China Lost Decade will yield a mountain of recent articles presenting a dire outlook for China by drawing similarities to Japans Lost Decade in the 1990sNobel laureate Paul Krugman recently shared on his  that he thinks China could probably end up in a worse situation than Japans Lost Decade Krugman highlighted Chinas deteriorating demographics including the middleincome trap declining workingage population and rising youth unemployment rates Other prominent economists including  think that China will face a balance sheet recession where consumers and businesses are looking to repay debt instead of borrowing and investing Without decisive and substantial fiscal stimulus economists are concerned that China is more likely to drift toward economic stagnation than to see the rebound that many investors have been waiting forChinas longterm developmental challenges are structural in nature as the lowhanging fruits of catching up to the developed world have been mostly exhausted Chinas maturing economy will need to evolve to be more selfsustaining without having to rely on exports as manufacturing wages rise and its welleducated youths will demand better wages and whitecollar jobsHowever economies do not evolve naturally into a complex ecosystem of highvalue industries supported by innovative research institutions and a highlyskilled labour force This is especially true if the rapid development of an economy has been mostly dependent on exports to other highincome nations Without policy initiatives by the government to stimulate domestic demand install innovative research institutions and nurture a highly educated and skilled workforce economic growth is unlikely to be sustained as wages and labour productivity catch up to the developed worldPerhaps Chinas own success is also its biggest weakness Having expanded its economy so rapidly within just a single generation the country has not had the luxury to rebalance and restructure its economy to focus on domestically driven growthIn terms of demographics there are also worrying signs that Chinas history of suppressing nationwide fertility rates for decades will begin to place an increasing burden on a shrinking workingage population to drive growth and finance higher healthcare spendingBelow is a series of charts comparing the expected evolution of Chinas population pyramid to that of Japan and the US Notice how Chinas population pyramid closely resembles that of Japan with a widening top and a narrowing bottom reflecting an ageing population being supported by a shrinking workingage populationIn contrast the US is expected to maintain a relatively wellbalanced population pyramid with a wide bottom and a narrowing top reflecting a healthy and stable workingage population over timeOne of the most grossly underestima,149,2023-07-31,3

122,Growth Of Real GDP In Q3: What's Going On?,The yearoveryear growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product in the United States was 29 percentOne year ago the yearoveryear growth rate of real GDP was 17 percentTwo years ago the yearoveryear growth rate of real GDP was 47The United States economy produced a very strong increase in the third quarter of 2023 but must be considered within the context of what has been going on in the economy over the past few years as the US has had to deal with a spread of the Covid19 pandemic and a following recessionIn one word the recent behavior of the US economy has been disjointedA lot of things are out of whack and this condition of disequilibrium must be taken into account in order to understand what is going onIt is my belief thatAs I have described elsewhere the Federal Reserve responded to the spread of the Covid19 pandemic and the subsequent recession very aggressively That is the Fed pumped lots and lots of money into the economy in order to make sure that the economy did not collapse and move into a serious economic contractionMy conclusion on this fact is that the Feds actions provided a substantial floor on economic activity and prevented the United States from moving into a more serious downturn The Fed succeeded very well in these effortsOver the past year the Federal Reserve into a position of quantitative tightening in order to fight inflation For 19 months the Fed has reduced the size of its securities portfolio in order to tighten up on the banking system and squeeze out the excess liquidity that it has injected into the system during the 20202021 periodBecause of the behavior of the Federal Reserve most analysts expected that a recession would take place in either late 2023 or in early 2024As can be seen by the numbers presented above through the third quarter of 2023 it does not appear as if the US economy is going into a recession nor does it appear that an economic recession might happen any time soonWhats going onThe Federal Reserve is certainly conducting a policy of quantitative tightening and has reduced the size of its securities portfolio by over 11 trillion in the last 19 monthsThe problem might be that the Federal Reserve in combating the possible financial collapse put a lot more liquidity into the banking system than this amount the amount the Fed has currently removedIn fact during the buildup to protect the financial system the Federal Reserve increased its securities portfolio by more than 46 trillionThus so far the Federal Reserve has reduced the securities portfolio by less than onequarter of the increase that took place earlierWhat does this seem to be allowingWell lets take a look at the M2 money stockIn 2020 the M2 money stock growth took off and rose and rose and rose up into March 2022Money stock growth acceleratedand inflation began to pick up the inflation that the Fed came to fight in March 2022With all this money moving into the banking system why didnt inflation rise to even greater heights Why did the economy stay so benignWell people didnt go out and spend all the moneythats whyThe velocity of the M2 money stock initially plummeted Recipients of the Feds largess just held on to a lot of the excess funds that the Fed pushed into the systemIt appears as if this is the major reason that the economy did not come out hotter from the Feds efforts and why economic growth seemed to show weakness when there was really a lot of liquid spending power still on the booksAs can be seen from the chart however the M2 velocity has been picking up in recent quarters and one of the driving forces behind this rise in the velocity measure in recent quarters has supported the economic growth that has come in at a faster pace than analysts had been expectingThe real strength in the current figures has been consumer spending These are the people who ended up with a lot of the monetary injection taking place during th,2,2023-10-28,3

126,Will Lower Inflation Halt Rate Hikes?,The Federal Reserve raised its federal funds rate target range to 525 to 550 percent on Wednesday In June the median member of the ratesetting committee projected the federal funds rate would climb to 56 percentThe  PCEPI which is the Feds preferred measure of inflation grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of 29 percent from June 2022 to June 2023 It grew at an annualized rate of 25 percent over the last three months and just 19 percent over the last month In other words inflation is falling fastCore PCEPI which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is therefore thought to be a better predictor of future inflation is also falling Over the 12month period ending JuneWill lower inflation cause Fed officials to forego further rate hikes Maybe Disinflation passively increases the real ie inflationadjusted federal funds rate When inflation falls faster than Fed officials expect real interest rates rise faster than Fed officials intended when they set the nominal interest rate target If the real rates rise high enough Fed officials might be able to achieve their desired level of tightness without pushing its nominal rate target higherJudging by interest rates monetary policy looks sufficiently restrictive The  estimates the natural rate of interest at 058 to 114 percent Using the prior months core PCEPI inflation rate of 37 percent as an estimate of expected inflation implies the real federal funds rate target range is 155 to 180 percentwell above the natural rate If one were to use last months headline PCEPI inflation rate instead it would imply the real federal funds rate target range is even higher 335 to 360 percent No matter how you slice it real rates look sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation Indeed they may be restrictive at this stage in the tightening cycle also suggests monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive In the 10year period prior to the pandemic nominal spending grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of 39 percent Nominal spending surged in 2021 growing 115 percent But it has fallen in the time since In 2022 it was 71 percent It grew at an annualized rate of 60 percent in Q12023 and just 46 percent in Q22023 Although it is not yet back to the prepandemic average growth rate it is on track to normalize by the end of the yearIf monetary policy is already sufficiently restrictive why is it not so clear that the Fed will forego further rate hikes In brief some Fed officials are not yet convinced theyve done enoughand dont want inflation to resurge on their watchGovernor Christopher Waller made the case for further rate hikes in  Waller argues that monetary policy lags are much shorter following large shocks like the 525basis point increase in the federal funds rate that has occurred since February 2022 Whereas people might be rationally inattentive to small shocks and as a consequence react slowly they cannot help but notice large shocks and hence respond more quickly Waller also argues that the start of the lag begins not when the Fed raises its federal funds rate target but rather when it announces it will raise its federal funds rate target in the futureat least so long as such announcements are deemed credibleIf monetary policy lags are shorter and start sooner than more conventional estimates suggest the bulk of the effects from last years tightening have passed through the economy already and we cant expect much more slowing of demand and inflation from that tightening To me Waller concludes this means that the policy tightening we have conducted this year has been appropriate and also that more policy tightening will be needed to bring inflation back to our 2 percent targetIf Wallers argument carries the day Fed officials will raise the federal funds rate target range another 25 basis points in September or November If disinflation continues over the next few month,2,2023-07-31,1

129,TLT: Deflation Is Still Risk And Bonds Are Cheap,I  on the iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond ETF  in March following the collapse of SVB bank when the macroeconomic outlook appeared highly deflationary following the surge in interest rates and collapse in money supplyThe TLT holds US Treasuries of maturities of 20 years or more with a weighted average maturity of around 26 years and an effectiveWhen it comes to bond investing inflation expectations are much more important than headline CPI For a bond fund such as the TLT which has an average maturity of 26 years current CPI figures are of much less importance than investor expectations of inflation over long term years The chart below shows 30year breakeven inflation expectations as measured by the yield spread between 30year US Treasuries and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities 30year bond yields have risen alongside rising inflation expectations as investors require higher compensation for this inflationWe can break down longterm bond yields into inflation expectations and the real yield above expected inflation that investors require As the chart below shows the most important driver tends to be the real yield which most of the time exhibits larger moves relative to inflation expectations However during market panics collapsing inflation can cause bond yields to fall sharply as we saw in 2008 and 2020I am confident that the average inflation rate over the next 20 years will be higher than the 23 implied by 30year breakevens As I argued in  the widening fiscal deficit and inevitable rise in money supply relative to productive capacity suggest inflation may average significantly higher than this However there is a growing risk that inflation expectations and headline inflation itself fall sharply over the coming quarters as demand for cash rises amid falling equity and real estate pricesWhile over the long term inflation is driven predominantly by the supply of money and government bonds relative to real output in the short term it is driven largely by psychological factors that determine consumer and investor demand for cash relative to goods and services While recessions themselves are inflationary as more money chases fewer goods and services market panics are highly deflationary During periods of falling assets consumers and investors seek liquidity regardless of its supply outlook This demand for liquidity takes the form of US dollar cash and bonds which has the potential to become selfreinforcing as falling assets cause increased demand for cash which causes further declines in assets etcWhile such panics are rare they have previously tended to occur under similar circumstances as we see today Specifically with bond yields rising equity valuations at extremes money supply in contraction and the real economy weakening These are the conditions under which investors have typically sought the safety of Treasuries and shunned equities and other risk assets The chart below shows the ratio of the SP 500 over the TLT alongside longterm inflation expectationsEven if we do not see a deflationary episode and inflation expectations continue to rise the TLTs yield of 45 offers a high margin for any such increase while still allowing investors to generate positive real returns The 21 real yield is the highest since 2011 which is significantly higher than the real GDP growth outlook Even with headline CPI widely expected to fall longterm bond yields are back above their fair value implied by nominal gross domestic income The chart below shows the fair value 10year yield based on its historical correlation with GDI 10year yields are current 70bps above fair value on this basis which is the largest spread since 2011In the short term the main risk to the TLT comes from continued high interest rates as interest rate futures are already pricing in quite aggressive cuts over the coming years and a long pause would likely send yields higher across the board However the,304,2023-09-18,3

Which Is A Better Choice Now?,Government bonds or stocks If you were picking an asset class to outperform over the next 1824 months which would you choose Such was an interesting point made by Greg Feirman last week To witIf we use the recent highs for the Nasdaq 100 index ETF  Greg is assuming a roughly 38 decline in the Nasdaq While that sounds like a massive decline it would only wipe out the 2023 gains However the long government bond trade in TLT would net roughly a 42 gain as bond prices returned to the beginning of 2022Gregs assumptions are not as outlandish as they may seem If interest rates as shown return to levels of an expected recessionary period you can understand the value proposition made Interest rates are a function of economic growth and inflation Therefore when the next recession begins rates will fall accordinglyWe see the same in comparing the annual rate change versus real economic growth ratesThe problem is that investors dont look ahead and instead focus on what happened in the recent past In 2022 bonds had the most significant drawdown since 1788 due to the massive surge of economic growth and inflation caused by more than 5 trillion in Federal interventions Investors now believe that period was a naturally occurring phenomenon of more robust economic growth suggesting higher rates are coming Such has also supported higher stock prices and hopes of improving earnings growthHowever as monetary liquidity reverses and the lag effect of higher interest rates collides with economic realities the risk of a recession indeed remains prevalent But even if the economy does avoid a recession and only slows down with stocks overvalued and Government bonds deeply undervalued there is an opportunity for those who can look ahead rather than behindThe chart below shows a  long view of interest rates in the US since 1854As noted interest rates are a function of the general economic growth and inflation trend With more robust growth and higher inflation rates lenders can charge higher rates to borrowersUnlike stocks bonds have a finite value At maturity the lender receives its principal and final interest payment Therefore bond buyers know the price they pay today for the return they will get tomorrow Unlike an equity buyer taking on  a bond buyer is  money to another entity for a specific period Therefore the  takes into account several substantial Since the future return of any bond on the date of purchase is calculable to 1100th of a cent a bond buyer will not pay a price that yields a negative return in the future As noted since bonds are loans to borrowers a bonds interest rate is tied to the prevailing rate environment at the time of issuance However with existing bonds traded on secondary markets the price is determined by the difference between the coupon rate and prevailing rates for similar obligations The benchmark rate acts as the baselineLets review an exampleBond AFor the person who loaned the money the 5 coupon for 12 months is sufficient to offset various market and economic risksNow lets assume the benchmark interest rate falls to 4Since rates are generally tied to a primary benchmark for bonds to become overvalued the benchmark rate would have to become detached from the underlying metrics that drive the level of borrowing costsThat is not the case todayAs noted above rates are a function of economic activity inflation and wages The relationship shown above should be unsurprising The  for lending money must account for economic growth and inflation expectations Therefore rates and expectations must adjust for the potential future impact on the current value of invested capitalThe correlation between rates and the economic composite suggests expectations of sustained economic expansion and rising inflation are overly optimistic At current rates economic growth will likely return to sub2 by 2024The jump in economic growth in 2021 has seve,40,2023-08-15,3

137,Interest Rates Won't Be Higher For Longer: SPY Implications,Interest rates at higher levels for longer That seems to be the prevailing market sentiment right now causing stocks in general and certain sectors in particular to sell off quite hard However we believe that this view is overlooking some key macro trends that will veryInitially the yield curve inverted sharply as investors had been convinced that a hard landing was coming for the economy in response to the Federal Reserves sharp interest rate increases but with the unemployment rate remaining surprisingly low and resilient consumer spending propping up theInvestors initially dismissed these rising Treasury yields as a sign of economic growth However they are now  that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated longer than previously expected with oil prices soaring and Core CPI still having a ways to go to reach the Feds target 2 rateWhile the sharp rise in oil prices does seem at first to deal a fatal blow to the case for meaningful interest rate cuts in the near future there are five reasons why we believe that interest rates are still likely headed lower in 2024First the Federal Reserves own dot plot still indicates that this will happen with only one member of the FOMC expecting a single interest rate hike next year and the vast majority expecting one or more rate cutsMoreover this committee also overwhelmingly expects even deeper cuts in 2025 and 2026 Granted the dot plot should not be taken as formal guidance but it is a meaningful indicator because it reveals the current thinking of those individuals who have the most impact on the future direction of interest ratesThe second reason why we do not think that interest rates will remain higher for longer is that the already heavily indebted Federal Government continues to spend money far faster than it is bringing it in Moreover there are strong catalysts for sustained levels of elevated spending such as the war in Ukraine the growing arms race with Communist China and the growing commitment by those on the US political left to subsidize renewable energy and redistribute wealth As a result the Federal Reserve will feel immense political pressure to cut interest rates sooner rather than later otherwise the interest expense on the Federal debt will become overwhelmingThird we think that a recession is increasingly likely to hit if interest rates remain elevated After a decadeplus of very easy monetary policy the economy has become addicted to lowcost debt and nearly the entire real estate industry is going to face a world of hurt if interest rates remain elevated as nearly 15 trillion in debt  in the next few years Moreover the consumer is heavily indebted and  given that much of their consumption is debtfinanced as is much of corporate growth spending  higher interest rates for longer will cause the economy to come to a screeching halt if pressed too farFourth 2024 is a major election year in the United States The Federal Reserve will likely feel pressure to not risk breaking the economy and potentially impact the elections outcome in the processFifth technological innovation  particularly the rapid advance of artificial intelligence and robotics  should prove to be very deflationary for the economy While it may not be enough on its own to overcome the runaway spending of the government it will give some flexibility for monetary policymakers to cut interest ratesRising treasury yields and growing concerns about interest rates remaining higher for longer have weighed on SPY pushing it about 7 lower since its peak in late JulyUp until then the AI driven mania had fueled a strong rally in SPY as its largest  are megacap technology companies that are investing heavily in the new technologyHowever higher interest rates will likely continue to weigh heavily on these companies for the following reasonsWhat this means is that ifwhen interest rates reverse course SPY should enjoy some strong tailwin,70,2023-09-28,1

139,'Soft Landing' Hope By The Fed Is Likely Optimistic,The Feds  hopes are likely overly optimistic Such was the context of the recent  which discussed the long record of the Feds economic growth projections To witAs we noted the Feds outlook for more robust growth allowed them to keep one rate hike on the table While the prospect of further rate hikes spooked the stock andAre the Feds  hopes wrong Similarly the combination of easing inflation and a cooling labor market has fueled  hopes among economists and Federal Reserve officials However soft landings are elusive as the Fed often holds rates too high for too long Eventually something breaks financially economically or both leading to recessions and bear marketsThe Fed and most economists were wrong in 2022 when they forecasted an economic contraction Economic growth the labor market and consumer spending proved unexpectedly resilient despite rising interest rates and elevated inflation Much of that growth remains from the massive monetary liquidity still flowing through the economyWith the restart of student loan payments the UAW strike and stillhigh prices eating into consumers excess savings that support is fading However other measures with nearperfect track records predicting recessions also suggest  hopes are likely wrongThe Leading Economic Index is one of those indicators that should not be dismissed As its name suggests the data is forwardlooking With a negative reading for 17 months straight the recession warning is quite evident As shown a recession occurred whenever the Fed hiked rates and the 6month rate of change in the LEI was negative by more than 2However our own Economic Output Composite Index which comprises more than 100 data points of hard and soft leading and lagging indicators confirms the warning of the leading economic indexNotably since we know that increases in interest rates impact economic growth it is unsurprising that when the annual rate of change in interest rates spikes economic growth slows Given the magnitude of the current rate of change in interest rates on a heavily indebted economy the  hope seems to be a stretchBut one indicator suggests recession is most prominent in the second half of 2024 Of all the economic indicators we regularly review one has continually preceded economic recessions While soft landing hopes are high the inversion of multiple yield curves suggests those hopes are misplaced As discussed previously the media always assumes this time is different regarding yield curve inversions because a recession didnt occur immediately upon the inversion There are two problems with this way of thinkingAs discussed in  if you wait for the official announcement by the NBER to confirm a recession it will be too late To witWhile many analysts will focus on one yield curve inversion we monitor and track ten different yield spreads affecting various economic areas Currently 90 of the yield spreads we monitor shown below are inverted which historically is one of the best leading recessionary indicators However even then it was several months before the economy slipped into recessionWhen these yield spreads turn negative and a recession doesnt occur immediately the media discounts the risk Such is why before previous recessions there were  hopes As shown a recession followed an inversion of 50 or more of the tracked yield curves Note that during the 1995  yield curves never inverted When the longer duration yields begin to fall such will coincide with a decline in economic activity Then the  hopes will fade into an economic recession realityThe yield curve is sending a message that investors should not ignore Furthermore  investors tend to act sooner rather than later Of course the contraction in liquidity causes the decline eventually exacerbating the economic contraction While consumers may continue to support economic growth such will change dramatically when job losses occur As job lo,27,2023-09-29,3

141,Economic Data Points Diverge,Since the beginning of the year economic data has continued to defy the recession calls of 2022 Therefore it is unsurprising that economic data surprised analysts more dire predictions last year Of course given the underestimation of the economy previously the riskThe upgrading of estimates also contributed to the discussion of the Federal Reserves need to raise the The neutral interest rate is measure of the neutral rate and it The issue as always is that economists are looking at lagging economic data to make assumptions about the future However after over 40Naturally if the economy grows at a slower natural rate  Furthermore and most importantly in the context of this discussion avoiding a recession becomes increasingly challenging at lower growth ratesWhile analysts become more optimistic about economic growth the divergence of the economic data suggests increased risk to that outlookAs is always the case predicting a recession is incredibly difficult The influence of monetary and fiscal policy corporate actions and other events can increase or delay the recessionary onset Nonetheless restrictive policies such as higher interest rates and tighter lending standards will curtail the consumption that drives economic growth The chart below is a composite index of bank lending standards and interest rates versus GDP The financial conditions composite is inverted to compare declines in economic activity better Unsurprisingly tight financial conditions always precede weaker economic growth rates and recessionsCritically what drives the economic cycle must be understood We often speak of the consumption side of the economic equation however consumers can not consume without producing something first Production must come first to generate the income needed for that consumption As analysts increase earnings estimates the earnings derived from corporate revenues are a function of consumer spending Such is a crucial part of the cycleOf course if you bypass the production phase of the cycle by sending checks directly to households you will get a strong surge in economic growth As shown in the chart below the massive spike in economic growth in the second quarter of 2021 directly resulted from those fiscal policiesHowever once individuals spent that stimulus the economic activity subsided as the production side of the equation was still lagging Here is the crucial point For a household to consume at an economically sustainable rate such requires fulltime employment While the media touts the  such is mostly the recovery of jobs lost during the economic shutdown As shown fulltime employment as a percentage of the workingage population has only recovered to prepandemic levelsIn other words we have NOT created millions of new jobs as touted by the current administration but rather only recovered the jobs lost and the increase in the workingage population since the economic shutdown However higher inflation and interest rates require more income to maintain the same growth ratesThe production side of the equation is now ringing a loud alarmLets review the economic cycle equation once againIt is a relatively simple economic concept that seems to elude the vast majority of mainstream analysts and seemingly the Federal Reserve itself However there are two measures of economic activity The most common measure is  which is simply the sum of  The other less observed measure is  The calculation of GDI is as followsTherefore given that GDI measures the income side of the equation derived from production it is logical that GDI should track pretty closely to GDP over time Furthermore it should be logical that deviations between production and consumption should indicate a shift in the economic underpinningsAs shown below in 2021 and 2022 real  GDI supported economic growth With 5 Trillion in stimulus supporting incomes the consumption side of the equation rose H,18,2023-09-08,3
142,The 2023 Recession Is Still Likely Coming,There is always a lot of noise in the financial media about the state of the economy but most of it is to quote Shakespeare sound and fury signifying nothingSo lets look at some dataWhat we find in the data is a steadily softening economy that has so far managed to avoid recession but is losing its last few remaining growth drivers The huge savings buffer built up during the pandemic years has steadily depleted for most Americans causing higher prices to increasingly eat into consumer spending power The magnitude of these savings has delayed the recession but we still view a nearfuture recession as highly likelyAs we have  in theThe primary cause of REITs poor performance over the last year or so has been rising interest rates so the reversal of rates trajectory from rising to falling should give REITs a huge boostHere are some highlights to considerPundits in the financial media often assert that the consumer is strong pointing to rising household net worth from buoyant homes and stock marketsThe problem with this thinking is that it succumbs to the tyranny of averages That is talking about the average American consumer ignores and downplays the widely varying financial conditions of different consumersThere are really two basic categories of American consumersThere are probably other basic differences but you get the ideaAbout 3040 of Americans are Affluent consumers while 6070 are more or less living P2PFrom mid2020 through 2022 both types of consumers were flush with cash from Uncle Sam and happy to spend it This provided fuel for the inflationary surge while also driving business expansion job growth and demand for commercial real estate Consumer inflation translated into rent growthBut in 2023 that situation is changing Affluent consumers are going back to their normal preCOVID spending patternsMeanwhile P2P consumers are increasingly feeling the pinch of inflation and depleted savingsOn  including both Affluent and P2P Americans are only able to save 35 of their income which is less than before COVID19 In fact its the lowest level since 2008This average means that the Affluent consumer is saving something north of 35 of their income while the P2P consumer is saving virtually nothing or even spending more than their income negative saving rateWhen looking at  personal savings we can see the huge spikes in pandemicera savings in 2020 and 2021 followed by a steep drop in savings in late 2021 that continues to todayAccording to the San Francisco Fed 100 of the pandemicera excess savings will be depleted by the end of this month September 2023And now rather than consumer spending being fueled by pentup savings consumption will have to be funded by growth in disposable income This has been minimal in a real inflationadjusted sense since government stimulus efforts ended in 2021Since the beginning of 2022 real disposable personal income per capita has increased a total of 12 less than 1 on an annualized basisAgain its useful to differentiate here between the Affluent consumer and the P2P consumerAmid the severe labor shortage of 2021 and 2022 the lowerincome worker saw their wages soar higher as employers competed to fill jobs But in 2023 that labor shortage has become less acute leading to smaller wage increases The labor force participation rate is now only 60 basis points lower than it was immediately preceding the COVID outbreak while aggregate demand has pulled back from its peak levelThus without the benefits of excess savings or high wage growth to act as shields from inflation the P2P consumer has rapidly weakened this yearThis explains a few major economic phenomena present right nowFor example if the American consumer is so strong why is credit card debt soaring to new highsIts because the P2P consumer gains very little benefit from buoyant home and stock prices The vast majority of home and stock value ,86,2023-10-07,3

But Is That A Good Thing?,Once again due to the ongoing lack of fiscal responsibility in Washington the markets and the economy faced a Government shutdown After a day of theatrics Congress passed a stopgap measure that will keep the Government operating for 45 days But is that aFirst of all while much media hyperbole surrounds Government shutdowns much like the debt ceiling there is a long history of shutdowns going back to the 70s As Katherine Buchholz of Statista recently pennedWhile the latest measure provides funding we will likely deal with this again in midNovember What is notable however is that the Government has stopped functioning normally since 2008 Before the Obama administration the Government operated on an annual fiscal budget The House of Representatives would put together a budget for spending the Senate would make its modifications and then it would go back to the House for reconciliation Once complete it would move to the President for signature Funding would then be allocated accordinglyHowever since 2008 the Government has continued to operate without a budget Rather than passing a budget each year a  is passed to fund spending The problem with using is that it uses the previous spending levels and increases that spending by 8 Such is why since 2008 the debt has exploded as spending is compounding annuallyOf course given the massive surge in spending revenues cannot keep up the pace leading to a rapid increase in debt issuance and a trending deficitIt is worth noting that before 2008 revenues were greater than the running growth trend of public debt However post2008 such has not been the case Subsequently the growth in the deficit continues to accelerateHowever does this mean a calamity is at hand with the Government now shut downWhile the media and Government officials will declare victory over avoiding a Government shutdown is it a victory Washington DC has a long history of  to avoid doing its  of governing That job sometimes includes making unpopular decisions that cause shortterm pain for a healthier economy in the years aheadRather than taking the easy path it is essential to understand what occurs during a Government shutdown Yes roughly 900000 workers will be furloughed While their salaries will accrue during the furlough the lack of income will impact economic growth That impact would be relatively minor and based on past shutdowns Goldman Sachs estimated a reduction of annualized growth by around 02 for each week it lasted after accounting for modest privatesector effectsGiven that the longest shutdown lasted 35 days as shown above you can estimate the impact on economic growth could be roughly as much as 1 Yes that is certainly concerning but with economic growth running near 5 according to the latest Atlanta Fed GDPNow such is not a recessionary concernWhat is critical to understand about Government shutdowns is that mandatory spending  continues as needed  Such is why it mainly involves Government employment and the shuttering of national parks and monuments According to Goldman Sachs the shutdown would have only impacted about 2 of Federal spending overall Notice that the vast majority of Government spending is directly a function of the social welfare system and interest on the debtThe above chart shows spending as a percent of GDP However using the 2023 data from the Center On Budget Policy we can better understand why we have a problem with our welfare systemAs of the latest annual data through the end of Q22023 the Government spent 63 Trillion of which 53 Trillion went to mandatory expenses In other words it currently requires 113 of every 1 of revenue to pay for social welfare and interest on the debt Everything else must come from debt issuanceWhile a Government shutdown would undoubtedly create a minor negative impact on economic growth maybe such would be an acceptable price to return the Government to so,8,2023-10-03,0

147,Why I Believe That Newmont Could Triple,Its time to talk about  the worlds secondlargest gold mining corporationOver the past three years shares have fallen 40 excluding dividends underperforming the VanEck Gold Miners ETF  by roughly 10 points Gold prices areMore recently gold miners have been hurt by falling gold prices sticky inflation and related mining risksWhile were likely stuck in a period of sticky inflation the single biggest bull case is further deteriorating economic growth which could force the Fed to cut rates Once that happens I expect a very steep increase in NEMs stock priceNow lets dive into the detailsNewmont is a giant In the second quarter the companyThis translated to nearly 1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over 650 million in cash from continuing operationsFurthermore the company has an attractive leverage ratio of 07x net debt to adjusted EBITDA Solid margins were sustained due to higher realized gold prices and consistent direct costsDespite these achievements the company had to acknowledge challenges during the quarter and make four pivotal decisionsHaving said that and with regard to the map above while the company saw challenges I like NEMs assets as its one of the best mines with limited geopolitical risks Most of its gold is produced in Tier 1 mines with major production in lowrisk jurisdictionsThe companys dominant position is also a result of the major A288 takeover of Australian Newcrest MiningIt also comes with other major benefits in light of the energy transitionAccording to  emphasis addedFurthermore with regard to some of the challenges I mentioned in the introductionBased on this context Newmont believes it can ramp up production in the second half of 2023 primarily driven by increased grades and tonnes mined across various locations including Subika underground and Ahafo open pitThe Cerro Negros expansion and Tanamis highergrade ore also contribute to the positive outlookSo despite challenges Newmont remains on track to meet its annual production guidance with the support of nonmanaged joint ventures Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo ViejoLooking at its fiveyear outlook the company is looking to boost production to the range of 61 to 67 million ounces per year lowering allinsustaining costs to no more than 1100With that in mind NEM is also a source of income for many investorsIn the second quarter Newmont declared a dividend of 040 per share or 160 per share annually consistent with the previous two quartersThis dividend translates to a 41 yieldAccording to the company the dividend falls within the 2023 dividend payout range of 140 to 180 per shareWhile its dividend isnt very consistent Newmont has maintained a dividend yield exceeding 3 for 11 consecutive quarters maintaining its position with the highest dividend per share in the gold sectorTheres also a lot of upside for the dividend if gold prices soar Looking at the data below we see that the company increases its free cash flow operating cash flow after investments in its business by 400 million for every 100 increase in the price of gold per troy ounceLooking at the overview below we see the aforementioned 140 to 180 dividend range againIn this case the company has a 100 base dividend backed by a gold price of 1400The company adjusts its dividend based on 300 changes in the gold price So based on current gold prices roughly 1900 the dividend range is 140 to 180That number is likely to rise significantly to the 200 to 300 range if gold rises 100  and remains elevatedBased on this context I believe that NEM could see a scenario of much higher gold pricesI have a bullish view on gold prices for one major reason the Federal ReserveWhile Ive been contrarian in my belief that both rates and inflation will remain elevatedsticky on a prolonged basis were now at a point where economic growth might become so poor that the Fed may be ,70,2023-08-28,0
148,The Cure For Rising Rates Is Rising Rates,It was an extremely volatile first day of trading for the fourth quarter While we squeaked out a small gain for the SP 500  it was fueled predominantly by the megacap technology names that haveFed officials cant seem to stop talking about how rates may need to stay higher for longer and some insist we need to increase the Fed funds rate multiple times to bring inflation down to target Yesterday Fed Governor Michelle Bowman Bowman also failed to acknowledge that the Fed does not focus on food and energy prices because of their volatility and the limited impact monetary policy has on both Her rhetoric on Monday helped propel rates higher across the curve which was music to the ears of billionaire investor Bill Ackman who has been promoting his outsized short position in longterm Treasuries in the financial media the past few weeksCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester who is not a voting member of the FOMC also suggested that we need one more rate hike this year to bring inflation back down to 2 I find it stunning that investors place so much weight on what these people say when they were completely blind to the coming surge in prices two years ago I suppose it makes sense to assume they would be just as blind to how quickly prices can fallNo matter how many billionaires attempt to talk rates higher for selfaggrandizement and no matter how often Fed officials express overly hawkish outlooks for monetary policy it does not change the incoming data To date it shows disinflation alongside economic resilience Last week we learned that disinflation remains well entrenched Yesterday we saw more economic resilienceISMs Manufacturing index PMI  for a third month in row to the level of 49 50 marks the line of demarcation between growth and contraction which was well above expectations of 478 The sector is on the verge of expanding again after eleven months of contraction This is another positive rate of change that could not be timelier as the services sector of the economy while still growing is starting to slow The production subindex increased to 525 and was positive for a second month in a row The employment index moved back into expansion at 512 Best of all the prices index plummeted to 436 which reinforces the disinflation we have seen in the PCE and CPIFurthermore construction spending rose 05 in August over the previous month and the July increase was revised up from 07 to 09 Overall construction spending has risen 74 over the past year The strength is balanced between public and private This is another positive rate of change that does not suggest we are on the cusp of an economic downturnThe recent rise in longterm bond yields which has driven the 10year Treasury yield  to 474 this morning is not consistent with the disinflationary trend the slowing rate of economic growth or depressed commodity prices It clearly has everything to do with the fear that the increase in supply to fund growing deficits will not be met with sufficient demand That has traders shorting longterm bonds accelerating the drop in prices and rise in yields in a selffulfilling prophecyThe only good news here is that the best cure for high interest rates is high interest rates Much as we have seen in the price of oil higher prices depress demand which leads to lower prices At some point higher interest rates start to fuel concerns about much slower growth which then leads to demand for bonds that drive yields back down I think we are close to that point The debate will be whether this process leads to an economic contraction or not I still think we avoid one because corporations and consumers are far less sensitive to rising rates today than they have been in previous business cyclesLots of services offer investment ideas but few offer a comprehensive topdown investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense Th,42,2023-10-03,0

150,The Real Reason Why The Eurozone Is Suffering From Labour Shortages,Despite the fact that the eurozone economy has broadly stagnated job creation remains strong and the eurozone labour market seems to be tighter than ever The good news is that the unemployment rate has fallen to a historic low of 64 on the back of this At the same time eurozone enterprises now see labour as the largest supplyside problem hindering their business and the ECB worries that the tight labour market will keep inflation above target for longer Clearly the labour market is one of the most important parts of the economy to watch at the momentStrong economic recovery and ageing populations are often cited as the key reasons for labour shortages What is often overlooked is the lower number of average hours worked per person that has occurred since the pandemic While the ECB has previously written about it and President Christine Lagarde mentioned it in her Jackson Hole speech the extent of the impact of this is very largeThe average number of hours worked per person was fairly stable between 2013 and 2019 It experienced a large drop during the pandemic  which was mainly caused by the massive takeup of furlough schemes  but has never fully recovered since While the recovery is still ongoing the trend has slowed substantially This means that more people are needed to do a similar amount of work At the moment this equates to 38 million more people employed than if everyone was working the average amount of hours they did in the years before the pandemicThis excess of 38 million workers equates to about two percentage points of unemployment adding to a substantial easing of labour shortages Of course a lot of people would not have been looking for work in an environment that was not this exceptionally tight however even using the Abel and Bernanke 2005 Okuns Law estimate we find that recent GDP growth should roughly correlate with an unemployment rate of 75 This is by no means high but it is high enough to not generate meaningful wage pressures according to the European Commissions natural unemployment rate estimateSo the argument that the current economy is so strong that it causes labour shortages does not really hold up especially given the fact that total hours worked have only just breached prepandemic levels Ageing populations  which are expected to cause the active population to shrink over time  are also not a reason for current shortages as the number of people at work and looking for work has never been higher than it is now The main cause for shortages seems to lie in lower average hours workedIt is tough to get a full picture of whats causing the average hours worked per person to remain so low Oddly the number of people working parttime has decreased since the start of the pandemic which actually has a positive effect on average hours worked When looking at the average number of hours worked by parttimers these are even increasing at the moment On the other hand the number of hours worked by fulltimers has come downSick leave and labour hoarding are plausible reasons for the drop in average hours worked as the ECB also concluded in a recent blog post Sick leave was up significantly in 2022 for countries providing data such as Germany the Netherlands and Spain but it is hard to match the numbers to the loss of hours worked This seems to be in part related to longCovid but other types of longerterm sick leave also seem to be up according to anecdotal evidenceLabour hoarding could also contribute to the lower average hours worked In these times of shortages businesses could be holding onto employees they might need in the future by making them work fewer hours The ECB reports that firms have been reluctant to let go of skilled employees who would be needed in the futureWhat could also be happening is that the people who have been hired since the pandemic want to work fewer hours bringing the average hours worked down In a tight labo,1,2023-10-27,0
151,Tax Receipts - Another Leading Recession Indicator?,Tax receipts are falling which has historically preceded economic recessions In a recent we discussed the issue of rising debt levels on economic growth and increasing debt levels To witAs noted in that post the problem of rising debt and deficitsAdding to the deficit problem is the aging demographic which is increasingly dependent on Government welfare programs for more than 50 of their incomes According to the  Here is the real kicker In 2022 the Federal Government spent 6 trillion equivalent to almost 20 of the nations entire nominal GDP  Of that total spending  5 trillion was financed by Federal revenues and 1 trillion was fundedthrough debt However that was as of the end of 2022 Since the turn of the calendar the combination of higher interest rates and inflation on the consumer is leading to increasingly slower economic activity As the economy slows revenues and incomes decline Given that Federal taxes are collected on individual and corporate incomes Federal tax receipts can tell us much about the actual strength of the economyOne of the conundrums in 2023 remains the avoidance of a recessionary impact from the Feds aggressive rate hiking campaign Numerous indicators from the leading economic index to the yield curve suggest a high probability of an economic recession but one has yet to occur One explanation for this has been the surge in Federal expenditures since the end of 2022 stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act The second reason is that GDP was so grossly elevated from the 5 trillion in previous fiscal policies that the lag effect is taking longer than historical norms to resolveHowever that red line in the chart above is the most interesting Notice that while Federal expenditures are rising Federal tax receipts are falling Such is why the national deficit is increasingThe change in Federal receipts is important as the Governments revenue is from the taxes on both corporate and individual incomes Unsurprisingly if revenues and incomes decline such would reflect economic activity As shown below there is a very high correlation between the annual change in Federal receipts and economic growth Historically when the yearly change in Federal receipts falls below 2 annual growth such has preceded economic recessions We see the exact correlation by smoothing the data and using inflationadjusted tax receipts on a 24month rate of change Again a recession follows when tax receipts fall below 2 annual growth rates I like this measure better as it accounts for the lag effect in the economy The 2year change in receipts has fallen to the 2 warning line Such explains why the recession has not occurred yet However that doesnt account for the magnitude of the decline in filings Secondly given the shuttering of the entire economy in 2020 which also delayed filings nationwide the extent of the current decrease seems more than just a single eventNonetheless for investors the implications should be evidentIf tax receipts are falling such suggests that economic activity is slowing ultimately impacting earnings growth investors have become quite exuberant that the economy will avoid a recession and earnings growth will return To witAnalysts will likely be disappointed over the next year because the stock market tends to correlate to the deficit As the deficit grows such will translate into slower earnings growth and a repricing of risk With the deficit increasing such will also push the Federal Reserve to pressure rates lower to cut the Governments interest expenseWhile many indicators suggest a recession is coming pay close attention to tax receipts The rising debt levels and increased servicing costs will act as a brake on economic growth A point recently made by Dr Lacy HuntThis is simply something the stock market will likely not be able to avoid The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editorsAfter having bee,3,2023-09-05,0

156,"Inversion Analytics Suggest Bottom In Long-Term Treasuries, Points To Fed Cuts In 6 Months",It is a relatively rare and powerful phenomena which occurred again in 2022 the US Treasury  To decode and analyze it further lets start with a longerterm overview about the US governmentThe important question is what is driving rates and yields at different maturity As the market perceives the Fed and theShortterm Treasury bill yields are primary pricing the current and perceived Fed policy rate curve for the maturity period History suggests that the Fed policy rate has a cycle of 46 years from first raising and last cutting Therefore the longterm yields are pricing longterm inflation and growth expectations as a 10year bond will potentially experience multiple Fed rate cycle through its lifecycleObviously the current rate cycle greatly effects longerterm yields as well however there could be large differences between shorter and longerterm yields One such large difference is when the yield curve inverts whereas the longerterm yields are below the shorterterm yields We can observe that the yield curve is typically upward sloping which means longerterm rates are above shorterterm yields Structurally all rates and yields are heading in the same direction which is determined by inflation however shortterm yields and rates fluctuate moreFrom 1983 the yields and rates have been in a structural decline due to structurally declining or stabilizing inflation The policy rate still experienced shorter 47 years cycles however each low and top was below the previous cycle This 40year sequence broke in 2022 as the current Fed rate and yields are at or above 2007 levels representing a 16year highIt is important to note that the US Treasury bonds are regulatory requirement for banks insurance companies and pension funds Other than them mutual funds hedge funds and money market funds are actively engaged in this market Foreign central banks holds their dollar reserves in US Treasuries as well as its the global financial systems primary source of collateral for dollar borrowing Arguably it is the most liquid market in the world More than that it represents the riskfree rate for a certain maturity therefore provides the base for all type of lending and borrowing activity such as mortgage rates credit card rates etcThe available treasury yields and real yields are greatly effecting the exchange value of the dollar therefore the global financial system and economy The discount rate of future cash flows in the  is usually the 10year treasury yield therefore it is a crucial component of equity and real estate valuation For all of these reasons it is highly important to decode the treasury curves and understand what it signals us Assessing longerterm inflation driven trends will be a subject of a separate article in the near future however shorterterm current cycle dynamics will be in focus mainly the yield curve inversion phenomenaThis is a relatively rare and an abnormal condition as longerterm yields should compensate you for locking in your capital in the form of term premia over rolling your capital over in shorterterm bills for the same period When the yield curve inverts the term premia gets negative The explanation for this lies in the expectations of future policy rates will be lower than currently such as the case now as wellThe 2024  2025 December contracts have been pricing lower collateralized 3month lending rate than the 2023 December rate since 2022 February  Currently the market is pricing in 85 bps 085 lower secured rate in 2024 and 136 bps 136  lower rate in 2025 December These numbers can fluctuate greatly over time as the yields represent the weighted average probability of the market consensus Therefore as the marketplace has been expecting lower rates in 2024 and 2025 than in the current year since the Fed began tightening longterm treasury yields are priced accordingly and if enough rate cuts are priced in ,85,2023-10-16,0
157,Portfolio Strategy For Inversion Cycle Suggests Buy 10-Year Treasuries And Sell S&P 500 In 2024 Q1,Investors may review the  where the average outcome of the historical yield curve inversions were analyzed and decoded in depth Lets point out that 2022 November was the 9thThe average outcome of the inversion cycle shows us that equity markets starts falling 4month prior of inversion and only bottoms out in the 31st months after The 10year yield is on average on a sharp rise for 24month prior to inversion with slightly declining until 8 months after However the top in the 10year yield is only set after a 3month sharp rise from the 9th to 11th month after the 10year and 3month yields invert On average the 10year yields collapse from the 16th to the 19thmonth period and by that time it reaches the levels 9 months before the inversion happened FED Funds rate are on a sharp rise as well before the curve inverts and the top of the policy rate on average is at the 14thmonth after inversion From the 14th month to the 20th month after inversion the policy rate collapses and tests back the levels of 6 month prior to inversion The real economic growth starts slowing 4 months prior to the inversion and on average it is decelerating until 28 months after inversion bottoming out 6 lower compared to the inversion point Note that deceleration does not equal contraction the inversion analytics revealed that the real economy enters negative growth from the 18th month and contracts until the 31st monthOn average both the cyclical economic growth FED rates and the 10year yield is supposed to start decline sharply in 2024 Q2 whereas 2024 April and May is being the 16th and 17th month after the 2022 November inversion As 50 of the average data sample builds on structurally rising rates and inflation the average inversion outcome indicates a sharp turnaround in the FED policy rate in the 24th month If the current inversion cycle will be deflationary then central bank rate is less likely to readjust higher from the 24th month due to the mass debt maturities and refinancing period starts in 2024 and lasts until 2027 However if inflation appears to be structural and reaccelerating it is more likely that the FED would have to engage in rate rises again even after cutting them heavilyThe 10year yield should test the levels of 9 month prior to inversion by the 19th month after which would mean the 2022 February levels of below 2 by 2024 July In the same period FED Funds rate should fall to 15Equity markets appears to have been pricing longerterm rate projections since the end of 2021 As the 10year yield rose in 2022 the markets sold off then when the yield stabilized around the 354  range for a sustained period it supported the SP500 to grow Since the end of July the 10year yield has broken out upwards from its 4 range top and rose sharply to 5 10year move is consistent with the average inversion outcome This move in longer term yields caused the SP500s ongoing correction since the end of July As the 10year yield has been tracking the average inversion outcome statistically we should expect it to decline to the previous range top of 4 in the coming 2 months from the 11th month 23 October to the 13th month 23 DecemberIf longer term will decline indeed then it would support the SP500 to retest the 2023 July highs or even alltime high is a possibility by yearend The data suggest that yields will start rising again from the 13th month to the 16th month and almost retesting the cycle high That suggest the SP500 starts falling from 24 January till 24 March on higher rate outlook Note that if the war in the current Middle East crisis escalates to a much more serious and wider confrontation the SP500 could start falling earlier than year end on geopolitical risks even with declining yieldsAs the economy enters contraction in the 17th month the equity market would likely go through a regime shift whereas the economic growth is the primary concern and even with fall,3,2023-10-30,0

161,Buy GDX Before It's Too Late,Its been more than a year since I wrote my most recent  covering the Back then my thesis was that a Fed pivot would be the most powerful tailwind for gold miners ThatThe price decline this year makes sense as the market has realized that a Fed pivot was not imminentHeres a part of my takeaway last year emphasis addedLast year I laid the groundwork for my thesis Now were getting to the next stage as a forced Fed pivot is getting closerIn this article Ill explain why I believe that GDX has a strong longterm riskreward based on an increasingly toxic mix of headwinds for the FedSo lets get to itLast year was one of the biggest fake rallies in gold in a very long timeEssentially gold rallied because the market expected the Fed to cut ratesThat didnt happenThe chart below shows the implied probability that the Feds interest rate is above 400 in September 2024In the first half of this year that number dropped to zero causing a steep rally in gold prices Now its at 100 indicating that the market does not expect the Fed to become dovish on a prolonged basisHaving said that why do rates matter so muchI believe that interest rate expectations are the biggest driver of gold pricesAfter all gold is essentially a currency with a 0 yield When interest rates are expected to rise investors prefer higheryielding investments When interest rates are expected to fall gold becomes more attractiveThe not updated chart below shows that gold is highly related to forward Fed Funds Futures If future rates are expected to fall gold tends to rallyLooking at the chart below we see a comparison between the GDX ETF and the threemonth SOFR the replacement of the LIBOR contract future for September 2025 2year forwardlooking interest ratesGold miners are unable to rally without a shift in longerterm interest rate expectationsSo the question is when are interest rates going to fall Or even more important when are investors starting to price in lower ratesWhile its still a long shot some analysts are starting to make the case that gold prices could recover next year as the Federal Reserve plans to reduce interest ratesDespite a recent decline exceeding 10 in the past six months primarily due to rising interest rates experts at the FT Mining Summit remain optimistic about golds mediumterm prospects as reported by the During the summit John Reade Chief Market Strategist at the World Gold Council stated that the current dip in gold prices represents a favorable opportunity to reengage with the precious metalHe emphasized that while the Federal Reserve might execute one or two more rate hikes the subsequent move after a period of pausing is anticipated to be rate cuts which would provide substantial support for goldI believe that this is a common consensus After potentially two more hikes the Fed will be forced to cut I even believe that the Fed can keep rates at current levels and would be able to do so much damage to the economy that inflation comes downThe problem is that the Fed will have to do a lot of damage to fight inflationAlso it needs to do it quicklyInterest rate costs are skyrocketing putting tremendous pressure on the Fed to quickly fight inflation in order to lower borrowing costs This is not a sustainable situationHence it doesnt help that inflation is turning out to be sticky As most readers might know my thesis has been for a very long time that inflation will be stickier than the market expectsIn September the Consumer Price Index surpassed expectations showing a 04 increase slightly higher than the projected 03 rise Excluding food and energy prices rose in line with expectations at 03Core goods prices continued to fall primarily due to a drop in used vehicle prices while core services inflation strengthened driven by a significant increase in owners equivalent rent and the lodging away from home categoryTo make things worse ,31,2023-10-13,0
162,GDX: Gold Miners Under Pressure From Rising Costs And Falling Revenues,Over the past three years volatility has caused many investors to flock toward alternative inflation hedge assets Gold performed very well during the initial government stimulus programs and QE efforts in 2020 Since then it has not held its weight primarily due to rising interest ratesMy perspective on precious metals has not proven correct since it was published The critical difference between my precious metals outlook and the markets reality isMost gold miners such as those in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF  are trading back near historical lows erasing all gains since 2020 after losing a quarter of their value over the past six months Notably the price of gold has generally maintained a high level still over a third above its preCOVID range at 1815oz Thus the weakness in gold miners may be attributable to either PE valuation declines or a sharp increase in gold mining costs Given this I believe it is an excellent opportunity to take another look at gold and gold miners to assess the markets rebound potential better or to revise my previous outlookWhile gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation it is better understood as a hedge against interest rates and the inflation outlook For example in 2020 gold soared in value due to  inflation and a sharp decline in the carrying value of fiat currency ie lower interest rates Today expected future inflation has moderated considerably while the carrying value of fiat currency is exceptionally high making the money market a much higheryielding investment than gold after inflationFundamentally gold and inflationlinked Treasury bonds are real assets but gold differs by paying no interest after inflation Thus gold is effectively discounted to the real interest rate There is a robust inverse correlation between the real Treasury rate and the price of gold See belowOf course gold is also an inflation hedge so it is most accurate to measure the real interest rate vs the inflationadjusted price of gold Gold is still nearly as expensive today as it was in 2020 but its value in inflationadjusted terms has declined a bit due to the rise in prices Accounting for this makes the gold and realrate relationship even stronger on a fundamental basis See below the inflationadjusted gold price unit is arbitrary since it uses the CPI For example todays price of gold is 634 X the CPI currently 306Using these data I calculated a relatively consistent inverse correlation of 08 between the two metrics over the past fifteen years The slope on linear regression is 093 with a 607 intercept Again these numbers have little meaning since the units are arbitrary but they can be used to calculate the price of gold based on real interest rates and the CPI today With a 245 real yield an extremely high figure the inflationadjusted fair value of gold based on this simple model is 38 times the CPI or 1163ozObviously that is an extremely low price compared to the current price of gold However around 20062007 the 10year real yield was around 245 and the price of gold was 650oz In todays dollars that would be roughly 1010oz indicating the same model would have  the price of gold back then Based on this model we expect gold to rise and fall by nearly 300oz for every 1 change in the 10year real interest rate on US Treasury bonds While this model is widely off today it is relatively accurate historically having an rsquared of around 63Without a doubt some variables could be added to the model that may make it more accurate and justify a higher price of gold today Still it is undoubtedly challenging to justify the current 1815oz gold price in light of the extremely high returns  inflation on 10year Treasury bonds For one gold may be overvalued due to excessive investor interest rising from public concern over black swan events and governmental issues since 2020 This is reflecte,16,2023-10-05,0

164,Petrobras: A Return To Bearish Ground As History Comes Full Circle,Over the past few months I have been one of the few Seeking Alpha analysts who have  a bearish outlook on Petrobras   due to various sources of political risks However this pessimism hasMy initial pessimistic stance was primarily rooted in concerns about shareholder control and the potential impact of government decisions on Petrobras especially given the companys historical context Legislative changes such as the injunction that reduced government control over stateowned companies could have substantial implications Its worth noting that Petrobras current CEO is a former politician from the same party as Brazils current president LulaOne of the fundamental questions for theIn light of these factors my outlook remains cautiously pessimistic Its crucial to closely monitor future developments and their potential impacts on Petrobras and the broader oil industry Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of this scenario and observing how the situation unfolds in the coming years will be intriguing Brazils history with past leftwing governments especially during Dilma Rousseffs administration has led to longterm value erosion for PetrobrasWhile its still too early to make definitive predictions I believe its highly improbable that the company will thrive under a management that repeats the same mistakes as those made in the past which clearly had a detrimental impact on its valueThe significance of oil to the Brazilian economy is a topic that deserves careful consideration in my opinion The true nature of this resource is often misconstrued Oil has served as the primary energy source throughout the past century and continues to hold that position Despite the growing shift towards renewable energy sources oil remains indispensable and is unlikely to become obsolete shortlyHowever owing to Petrobras being a stateowned company there exists a misconception that the oil it extracts exclusively belongs to the state This misconception stems from a historical slogan in Brazil Such beliefs lead people to expect low gasoline prices complicating Petrobras management and government decisionmaking Society must grasp that while oil is indeed a valuable resource it is not the sole property of Brazil and international factors influence its priceOil and natural gas constitute the primary sources of revenue for the National Treasury and this trend is expected to continue for many years Oil plays an integral role in Brazils trade balance and its production is rising In 2022 426 billion of crude oil was shipped  13 of total Brazilian exports a share only one percentage point behind soybeans Exploring new areas like the Equatorial Basin is imperative to maintain high production levels Oil is critical in the economies of various nations globally including Russia where it remains vital even during conflictThe Brazilian government often fails to comprehend the economic significance of oil and tends to focus primarily on fuel pricerelated issues People need to recognize that oil is both lucrative and pivotal to the economy and they must understand its relevance in the context of the global economyPetrobras has delivered positive results thanks to effective management in recent years particularly during the presidencies of Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro This has proven advantageous not only for Petrobras shareholders but also for the Brazilian economyThe current government led by President Lula experienced some luck concerning the price of the oil barrel From January until July the price fell to approximately 70 to 73 per barrel enabling Petrobras to lower gasoline and diesel prices However starting in July prices increased again surpassing 90Fortunately once again the exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the US dollar declined offsetting one factor against the other Petrobras still operates with some delays in price adjustments but these favorable factors,5,2023-10-16,0

166,Goldilocks And The Three Tailwinds, In a year filled with turbulence and economic challenges one word that encapsulates the prevailing sentiment in the United States is undoubtedly resilient Despite facing the steepest surge in interest rates in decades a nearly 20 surge in gasoline prices yeartodate and the resumption of student loan payments both the US consumer and the economy at large stand steadfast forging ahead while the unemployment rate hovers near historic lowsAs the year unfolded numerous voices chimed in late last year warning of an impending recession and admittedly we were among those who sounded the alarm However the US economy has not only defied these ominous predictions but has also left economic pundits and investors pondering the prospect of a soft landing  an economic slowdown without a surge in unemployment  or perhaps no landing at all This latter scenario envisions the US economy not only avoiding a decline but actually accelerating eluding the specter of recession altogether The postCovid recovery has proven itself to be an unprecedented phenomenon distinct from any previous rebound following a recession and this uniqueness continues to define the landscape in 2023While the calls for an impending recession are currently diminishing we foresee their resurgence in the coming months This anticipation stems from our belief that three of the major tailwinds that have propelled the economy and stock market toward this Goldilocks outlook are poised to morph into headwinds potentially altering the course of the economic journeyThis famous quote inflationadjusted from billion to trillion is attributed to Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen who served as Senate Minority Leader from 1959 to 1969 He used this phrase to express concern about the escalating federal spending that was happening at the time which ultimately contributed to the inflationary period of the 1970s Traditionally the government plays a role in stabilizing the economy during a recession and adjusts its spending as the economy recovers However recent times have seen a departure from this historical patternThe shift began with President Trumps tax cuts which reduced tax revenue and expanded the budget deficit This trend persisted even as the unemployment rate decreased during his tenure until the COVID19 pandemic struck in early 2020 As unemployment rates skyrocketed in 2020 so did government spending as is customary during economic crises However even from mid2020 to mid2021 when the unemployment rate began to decline significantly our budget deficit continued to soar largely due to the issuance of multiple stimulus checks reaching record levels under the Biden AdministrationDuring the Great Depression the deficit as a percentage of the economy measured as Gross Domestic Product GDP ranged from 35 in 1932 to 61 in 1936 This record was surpassed during World War II when the deficit relative to the size of the economy reached 63 in the 1943 fiscal year However these records were shattered during the Great Financial Crisis of 20082009 with the deficit growing to 98 in fiscal year 2009 Yet none of these events came close to the staggering 179 deficit witnessed in fiscal year 2020Government spending began to recede by mid2021 dropping from the peak reached in early 2021 to a low of 37 even as the unemployment rate continued to decline by mid2022 However a contraction in the economy occurred due to reduced government spending in the first half of the previous year compounded by a downturn in manufacturing sparking concerns of a recession Despite falling unemployment rates the Biden Administration implemented several significant spending packages including the 750 billion Inflation Reduction Act the 280 billion CHIPS and Science Act and the 300 billion PACT ActBetween June 2022 and June 2023 the US economy measured by nominal GDP grew by 155 trillion During the same period fede,19,2023-10-25,0

168,September's Strong Jobs Report Is Likely To Steepen The Yield Curve Further,The September jobs report was much stronger than expected rising by 336000 vs an expected 170000 What also was surprising was the big revision for the month of August which rose to 227000 from an initial 187000The jawdropping results pushed rates across the Treasury curve sharply higher even with the 30year rate briefly crossing above the 5 mark It also has resulted in a 10year real yield pushing up to almost 25 both new cycle highs This jobs report hits home about the need for the Fed to keep monetary policy higher for longer and this is something that the equity market has defied since the beginning of the rate hiking cycleThe equity market bet heavily on rates falling aggressively in the second half of 2023 and 2024 following the collapse of SVB and theThis has pushed yields up dramatically given the Fed Funds rate and the potential for another rate hike before the year ends It seems that rates on the back of the Treasury curve could rise even higher The spread between the 10 and the 2year has narrowed to 25 bps while the 30year minus the 3month Treasury rate has narrowed to around 50 bps These curves are steepening as the back of the yield curve rises to the front of the yield curveThe steepening of the yield along with the stronger dollar is resulting in high yield spreads also pushing higher which has led equity prices lower over the past few weeks as the earnings yield of the SP 500 rises tooThe market is now entering a new point in the cycle where we have passed the effect of monetary policy tightening Were now at the point where the bond market is taking over where the Fed has left off That means instead of rates rising on the front of the yield curve rates are now rising further due to the strongerthanexpected economic data tied with the Fed policyDue to the steepening of the yield curve the 10year rate may rise by another 25 bps in the coming weeks pushing the rate beyond the  Thats a key level I noted a few weeks ago that the 10year was likely headedIts generally when the yield curve steepens when stocks begin to struggle More recently some of the cycles with the largest steepening have resulted in very strong declines in equitiesIt also seems as if at this point stocks are trading with changes in the yield curve and credit spreads not directly with the actual nominal rate This has been most notable when comparing the Markit CDX HY CDSI Index and comparing it to the SP 500 earnings yield The two have been following each other closely now for several monthsHowever when looking at the spread between the SP 500 earning yield and the 10year rate that spread has continued to decline and has now fallen to less than 1 a level not seen since 2005 Overall the narrowing of this spread tells us that stocks are expensive vs bonds But this indicates that stocks are more sensitive at this point to changes in spreads than they are to actual ratesHowever it seems likely that spreads can continue to widen especially entering the part of the cycle where the lag effects of monetary policy come into play One reason monetary policy has been so ineffective could be the bond markets inability to price what higher for longer properly meant specifically how high those rates would need to be Now that the Fed is near the end of its cycle its becoming clear that the long end of the yield curve may settle out at roughly 5 or higher which would at least get the yield curve flatWith a flatter yield curve and high rates across the curve it seems likely that we should start to see the effects of higher rates work their way through the economy and that probably means that at some point over the next few months the economy begins to slow and more importantly it probably means that earnings estimates for the SP 500 in 2024 start to come downEarnings estimates are about 244 per share and are expected to grow by around 11 in 2024 from roughly 220 in 2023 Ho,1,2023-09-14,0

170,Why Are Mortgage Rates So High?,Thirtyyear mortgage rates were over 7 percent at the end of August 2023 a level not seen other than two isolated weeks since 2002 Why are mortgage rates so highFactors commonly mentioned areThese higher shortterm rates are reflected in higher longterm rates and higher yields to maturity on government bonds This indicates that the higher shortterm rates are expected to persistMortgage rates are most commonly compared to yields on 10year government bonds While 30year mortgages could potentially be paid off after 30 years most mortgages are paid off much sooner The maximum possible term to maturity for mortgages is much longerThe figure above shows why the 10year government rate is used for comparison Many of the larger and even smaller changes in 10year government bonds are reflected in 30year mortgage rates Hence part of the recent rise in mortgage rates simply reflects the rise in riskfree longterm interest rates such as the 10year government bond yieldThe thirtyyear mortgage rate hit its lowest level in 30 years the week of January 4 2021 the rate was 266 percent Since then it has risen to reports of rates as high as 75 percent last week The 30year mortgage rate averaged 709 percent for the week ending Thursday April 14 This is an increase of 444 percentage points from the rate in January 2022 Over the same period the yield on 10year government bonds increased quite a bit also but only 323 percentage points The spread between the mortgage rate and the 10year government bond yield has widened from 166 percent to 286 percentage pointsThe figure below shows the spread between the 30year mortgage rate and the 10year government bond yield The spread with the 30year government bond yield is similar Clearly the rise in riskfree government interest rates is not the sole explanation of the increase in mortgage ratesIf the mortgage rate had risen only as much as the 10year government bonds yield it would be 589 percent There is little doubt that a mortgage rate of 589 percent instead of 709 percent would make a big difference to many borrowersWhy has the spread increased The increase in the spread is unusual but not unprecedented As recently as the week ending April 20 2020 the spread was 271 percentage points The increase in the spread to 271 percentage points in 2020 is not surprising The United States economy was contracting with a recession from February 2020 to April 2020 and an unemployment rate of 147 percent Recessions make it harder for people to make their mortgage payments and mortgages become riskier investments The increase in the spread in 2008 is also associated with a recessionThe increase in the spread in 2023 is not associated with a recessionThe recent increase in the spread is due to a decrease in the demand for mortgages for reasons other than a recession Silicon Valley Bank which failed earlier this year held longterm securities which fell in value as yields rose Perhaps partly because of concern about interest rate risks going forward banks have decreased their holdings of mortgages Since the week ending February 23 banks holdings of mortgagebacked securities issued by the federal government have fallen 14 percent No doubt other holders of these securities also now view them as risky even if they dont have to dispose of them due to concerns about regulatorsBeyond the unfortunate implications for home buyers especially firsttime home buyers what can be learned from this episode Interest rates on mortgages were 266 percent just two and a half years ago Why the sudden increase in rates The Federal Reserve increased the money supply and generated the worst inflation in many years Additionally the Federal Reserve was attempting to manipulate interest rates to encourage interest ratesensitive activities That part of the plan worked The unexpected outcome is that the perceived interest rate risk of longterm mortg,28,2023-09-22,0
171,British American Tobacco: One Of The Most Interesting Investments In This Macroeconomic Environment, point to a potential stall in economic growth in 2024 which is why I increasingly feel the need to add consumer staples exposure to my portfolio The latter in addition to being resilient in the eventOf all of them I consider British American Tobacco   to be one of the most interesting both because I find it highly undervalued and because it issues a huge growing sustainable dividend with no withholding tax I think sooner or later the market will realize that it is making a mistake to undervalue this company so muchIn my opinion the main reason why British American Tobacco BAT from now on is so undervaluedThere have been many regulations over the decades to curb tobacco use and the biggest concern is that they have not ended there Every year there is talk of new bans new regulations to comply with yet the result is always the same BAT makes more and more moneyIn 2002 smoking was more widespread in the West than it is today yet this has not limited the growth of EPS BAT as well as its competitors has grown no matter what because its consumers have a physical dependence on their products The pricing power of companies that sell tobacco is enormous as are their profit margins In addition the fact that cigarettes cannot be advertised has only increased the competitive advantage of the giants because new competitors will have no way to make themselves known Overall this is a very concentrated highprofit market with almost impenetrable barriers to entryThrough 2027 Street estimates predict that growth may continue and even profit margins may improve The reason for this optimism is dictated by the fact that Vapours gross margin is rapidly approaching that of combustibles mainly due to the success of  At the moment this brand is one of the key growth drivers over the long termCertainly from an ethical standpoint investing in a company that generates harmful products is not the best but I do not agree with demonizing this industry For example obesity causes about 5 million deaths a year but no one would take a stand against CocaCola and McDonalds for that reason yet their consumers are also addicted and can incur health problems if they abuse their products There are many such examplesThe main difference lies in the fact that smoke is harmful even when inhaled so it harms not only those who smoke but also others around Anyway this is a problem that does not affect British American Tobaccos new products since they do not generate secondhand smoke Not only they do not harm people around but they also greatly reduce the health risks of the smokerThese products have recorded a CAGR of 33 since 2019 and the company expects to reach 5 billion in revenues by 2025 Today about  of revenues come from New Category and this figure is expected to increaseAt the moment New Category is still slightly unprofitable but by 2024 it should make its contribution to net income In other words for those who believe that tobacco companies no longer have growth margins this is not the case at allMoreover combustible tobacco still remains a gold mine compared to H1 2022 revenues from this  by 020 percent Definitely not an exciting growth rate but at this point I think the important thing is simply to keep revenues from decliningFinally I would like to briefly show you the financial results of British American Tobacco during the great financial crisis As mentioned in the intro I am doubtful about economic growth in 2024 which is why I am focusing my attention on companies that have performed well even during periods of great stressLooking at British American Tobaccos performance during those years would you ever say that there was one of the worst financial crises in recent history Revenues and free cash flow were steadily increasing while return on capital and ROE remained very high Put another way even though people had lost their homes they could not do without their Lucky S,3,2023-09-04,0

179,Resolving An Overbought Condition For The Stock Market,Stocks took a tumble for a third day in a row yesterday as the market looks for reasons to resolve the overbought condition that formed in the major market averages at the beginning of August At that time I shared theThis has provided the bearish side of the aisle with some hope that their defensive posture in 2023 may not beThis economic strength which has greatly diminished recession fears was met with renewed concerns about interestrate policy when the minutes from the Feds July meeting were released on Wednesday As expected most members expressed continued concern that the rate of inflation remained elevated but that is what they always do Regardless those concerns combined with this weeks strong data has renewed fears that the Fed may raise rates again which is fresh ammunition for the bears Timing is everything and this combination of events is fueling the flames of this pullback Longterm bond yields have crept higher with the 10year yield eclipsing its high of 425 from October of last year If fact we are at levels not seen since 2007 The bears tell us that this is because inflation is not contained and that the Fed will be forced to keep raising interest rates I think the rise in longterm rates is more a function of economic growth being much stronger than the consensus expected while institutional investors were positioned for just the opposite This is not necessarily a bearish development Instead it is a part of the normalization of the yield curve after a decade of manipulation by the FedRising longterm interest rates weigh on stock valuations which is what we have seen this week but if the rise in yields is coupled with stronger economic growth then the damage is greatly mitigated The SP 500 has pulled back approximately 5 from its recent high and it is now approaching a more significant support level at its 100day moving average near 4300 At the same time the overbought condition has largely been resolved with its Relative Strength Index approaching 30 top of the chartAnother sign that we needed a pause to refresh which I shared at the beginning of the month was that the percentage of stocks in the SP 500 trading above their 50day moving average was approaching 90 Prior readings at this level were precursors to pullbacks We have now fallen to 34 which is close to the 25 level where the market has exhibited an oversold conditionThe Russell 2000 smallcap index is closer to where I expect it to find support especially given the strength we have seen in the economy as of late We should test the 200day moving average today as the Relative Strength Index falls below 30 which is an oversold condition consistent with previous bottoms for the indexThe disinflationary trend remains well intact and I continue to believe the Feds ratehike cycle concluded in July The recent strength in the economy is nice to see but it is bound to slow as the lagged impact of rising interest rates takes its toll Still a recession does not appear to be in the cards which greatly increases the likelihood of a soft landing for the economy It is easy to lose conviction when stock prices are falling over relatively short periods of time but that incoming data supports a bull marketHow high could longterm interest rates rise I think we could see the 10year yield hit 45 but that is not a death knell for the stock market It would weigh most heavily on the expensive growth stocks that have fueled much of the markets gains during this bull market but that opens the door for continued rotation into more value oriented and cyclical sectors that do well in a more robust economic environment During periods of such rotation volatility rises and markets correct but new leadership emerges which is what supports a continuation of the uptrend That is where I see the market todayLots of services offer investment ideas but few offer a comprehensive topdown investment strate,144,2023-10-19,0

188,"Home Depot: Rocky FY23, But The Future Is Bright And Valuation Right",If you were to ask me what my favorite dividend growth stocks were I guarantee you Home Depot  would be among the top 5To put it simply HD is a popular store where peopleHD has impressively delivered a total return of 396 over the past decade more than doubling the return of the SP 500 Index  despite its fundamentally simple business modelNow the challenge arose when the pandemic ended and the Fed had to shift gears by tightening its policies raising interest rates due to soaring inflation This led to aThe increased rates significantly impacted peoples disposable income and their appetite for mortgage rates Many who had secured lowinterest rates during the pandemic were reluctant to move and lose their favorable ratesThis situation created pressure not only for Home Depot the home improvement giant but also for home builders like DR Horton So lets assess the current macroeconomic sentiment and see if Home Depot is currently a good bargain amidst these challengesLooking at the performance chart above its clear that home builders are holding their ground better than HDThe key factor here is that new homes are still selling but older ones where people secured lower interest rates are moving sluggishlyJust take a look at the graph below  the  soared to 749 in OctoberI mean wouldnt you rather stick with your cozy old home with a 3 rate rather than jump into a new one with such a high interest burdenIts worth noting that we havent seen interest rates like this since the early 2000s Its a challenging situation for anyone looking to buy or sell a homeHeres the situation more than a third of the  in the US are brand new a peak not seen in the last 20 years This trend is great news for construction companies but not so great for consumerfocused businesses like HD which thrive on renovations and DIY projects in older homesIn practical terms unless interest rates decrease motivating people to sell their older homes and invest in renovations HD could experience significant pressure in both earnings and stock performanceThe Fed is currently emphasizing the idea of  While Im confident theyll exert every effort to combat inflation and reach the 2 target theres already a noticeable cooling off in inflationOn one hand this rhetoric is a strategic move Creating a sense of fear among the public and consumers is a way to intentionally slow down the demand for goods and services consequently leading to lower inflationIn my view though its speculative a lot of  a cut in rates by around 1 in 2024 bringing the Fed Funds rate to the mid4 rangeIf this happens it could spur the economy by lowering mortgage rates reigniting the real estate market especially for older properties Companies like HD could seize this chance and capitalize on the opportunityAccording to  shared during their Q2 FY23 earnings call they anticipate a sales decline of 2 to 5 compared to FY22 reaching around 152 billionThe operating margin is also expected to decrease from the current 149 to somewhere between 14 to 143This is likely to result in a decrease in EPS of around 7 to 13 leading to an FY23 EPS of about 14This latest outlook is actually worse than what the company had initially expected at the beginning of the year indicating significant pressureHowever in my view considering the anticipated rate cuts in 2024 HD seems well positioned to endure these challenges and deliver better results beyond FY23Considering the 78 yeartodate decline in HDs stock the company is currently offering a dividend yield of 279 This rate is significantly higher than its fouryear average of 228 and surpasses that of DR HortonWhats even more impressive is Home Depots track record in dividend growth Theyve increased their dividend by a staggering 435 over the past decade averaging an annual growth rate of 435Additionally in February 2023 despite looming challenges ,14,2023-10-03,0
