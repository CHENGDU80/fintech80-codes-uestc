0,What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,First and foremost the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination This article is not about politics and it will not focus on whats right or wrong Instead we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent as of this writing are up 3 with WTI  trading above 85 and Brent above 87 Initially at the close of Friday WSJ published a report noting that the US is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high Soon after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel If you want to thoroughly review the events Some of you may wonder what does this have to do with oil Historically speaking geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions In this case Israel is not a major oil producer so whats the catch The catch in our view has to do with Irans potential involvement in this whole ordeal WSJ published a piece noting that Irans senior officials helped plan this attack months agoWhile the US has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on IranFor starters we need context to what we are writing In June  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market Since then IEA has confirmed via its figures that Irans oil production is close to 31 million bd Our supply  demand model assumes 33 million bd and official Iranian figures support that production is around 33 million bdPutting all of this together Iran is exporting close to 2 million bd Visible tanker exports account for 15 to 16 million bd while shadow exports account for 400k bdSince H2 2022 the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports As we wrote earlier in the year this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storageWith floating storage gone and crude exports back to 2 million bd 500 to 800k bd below the previous peak whats the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward Perhaps the US does nothing and leaves Iran as is but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view while the risk of a major loss is low we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months We think the average would fall from 2 million bd to 16 million bd In terms of visible tankers this means Irans crude exports would drop closer to 12 million bdWhile it wont be much of a decline it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into yearend and possibly well into H1 2024Looking at our latest supply  demand update we made a few important assumption changesIn essence global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by monthend And if the US starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports then our balance could surprise to the upside But with a deficit of 22 million bd the lack of production decline from Iran wont make that much of a difference eitherOn the other hand with no mega deal on the horizon between Israel and Saudi the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis wont be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least 110bbl With Brent trading at 87 we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a realityIn conclusion global oil inventories should accelerate downward But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession Fund flows will ebb and flow so oil prices wont skyrocket anytime soon Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception Until then we see prices grinding higher with frequent ,45,2023-10-13,2
1,The Saudis Are Dead Serious On Pushing Oil Prices Higher,In the years Ive followed the oil market I have never seen the Saudis this determined to push oil prices up This includes the whatever it takes moment we saw in 2017 when the previous Saudi energy minister Khalid AlFalih started targetingSaudi crude exports for the first 24 days of August are averaging at the lowest level since June 2020 At 53 million bd Saudis will have reduced crude exports by 1 million bd since July Now we dont expect this figure to be final Crude exports for the upcoming week are showing a rebound so final figures could be closer to 56 to 58 million bdBut that doesntThose of you who follow us closely will know that our base case view is for the Saudis to extend the voluntary cut into yearend We explained that its because of the logistical timing issue of when exports hit physical inventories and the impact on market sentiment But with the latest Saudi crude export figure I cant help but wonder if the cut will likely be extended into Q1 of 2024Let me explainHere is IEAs assumption for global oil supply  demand balance into the end of 2024 Out of all of the IEA reports weve read to date the August OMR was the most balanced surprisingNow you will notice that both Q1 and Q2 of 2024 show stockbuilds Keep in mind that the IEA is not assuming the voluntary cut of 1 million bd into its balance in 2024 Instead it is assuming that the Saudis will continue its original 500k bd voluntary cutIn my view the Saudis played this one beautifully By keeping it on a monthtomonth basis it deters speculators from bidding up the long end of the curve and keeps the market at bay The monthtomonth action also prevents speculators from frontrunning prices which prevents any potential risk of demand destruction amidst a weakening global economy Instead the voluntary cut does the sole purpose it was meant to do reduce global inventoriesSo now imagine this scenario as we approach the end of October oil continues to trade in the range of 80 to 90 While global oil inventories have drained materially sentiment remains weak and speculators believe the impending recession will hurt oil demand Saudis are now deciding whether to extend to the end of December but as they look at global oil supply  demand balances Q1 shows a build All of the efforts of the voluntary cut up to that point would be pointless if storage gets to build back up againWith the voluntary cut already in place whats to stop the Saudis from slowly unwinding the cut Perhaps its best to after Q1 to slowly unwind the 1 million bd cut as to avoid any inventory buildup In addition with Russia cooperating finally and if the Russians extend their voluntary cut into yearend then its physically very difficult for Russia to increase production during the heart of winter All of these things suggest to me that it is better than 50 chance that the Saudis extend this voluntary cut in some form or shape into the end of Q1 and possibly Q2 of 2024Now this is not the consensus view and many of the oil analysts expect the Saudis to unwind the voluntary cut once the storage draw has materialized but we digress We think the ultimate goal for the Saudis is price stability so if that implicitly implies a lower overall storage level to achieve this then the Saudis will keep the voluntary cut until they see fitThis means that Brent would have to easily average over 90 for many months before the Saudis contemplate a reduction We just dont see that when the consensus expects a build in Q1In the years Ive followed the Saudis this is the most determined Ive ever seen them If we are right and the Saudis continue to extend then the market will get a rude awakening Global onshore crude inventories are already starting to accelerate to the downside and theres more to come Perhaps like the article we published on Monday it is really just that straightforward Perhaps it is not We will know wit,296,2023-08-26,1
2,Chevron Offers Smoother Ride In Any Oil Market,Owning energy stocks can be like riding a roller coaster with no idea of when the ups and downs will come or how long they will lastWhile leveraged exploration and production companies provide the most thrill the reasonablyThe forward priceearnings ratio of 121 is way below the SP 500  ratio of 191 This lower multiple is typical of oil and gas stocks which have been out of favor due to volatility and climate change concernsThe shares are in the middle of their 52week range and sell for less than the Morningstar fair value estimate of 172The chart shows that except after the COVID19 oil bust of 2020 when free cash flowChevron management assumes a 12 return on capital at a base price of 60 realized barrel far below recent prices The company can operate normally even when Brent crude is at 50 executive vice president Nigel Hearne saidWith interest rates rising the market has been punishing companies that need to finance their growth Chevron has a sterling balance sheet with a debttoequity ratio below 15 percent the lowest among the largest US oil producersAfter backing out cash the net debt ratio is only 7 Why is this important Because oil prices while in a multidecade upward trend fluctuate widely Any company that knows where and how to stick holes in the ground can make money when prices are high But companies with a strong balance sheet also benefit when prices are low by buying distressed competitorsAn example of Chevrons capital discipline is how it withdrew from its tentative deal for Anadarko Petroleum in 2019 allowing Occidental Petroleum to take the bidding war with Warren Buffetts assistance rather than pay a price it viewed as excessive The company came out of the deal with a But when prices and valuations collapsed in 2020 Chevron was quick to buy Noble Energy with complementary assets in the Permian and DJ basins for only Contrast that with Exxon Mobils  recent deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for 595 billion With PXD having 24 billion barrels of proven reserves that works out to nearly 25 a share Obviously a lot of other factors besides reserves go into a valuation but the difference of 500 cant be ignoredWhile the 202122 rise in oil prices led to an SPleading rise in Occidental shares over that period Chevron stock has still done better since the 2019 battle And thats the pointowners of Chevron dont have to time the oil price cycle correctly to profit in the long termChevron is the only US oil company that holds a waiver from US sanctions to produce in Venezuela The Biden administration is negotiating to reduce sanctions in return for some semblance of a return to democracy According to Bloomberg  to drill new wells in 2024Venezuelan production is particularly profitable at the refining end because the country produces the heavy grades of crude that Gulf refiners need to balance out the light grades and even lighter condensate that comes from fracking in the Permian BasinThe draining of US crude inventories since the COVID peak in 2020 becomes clear when one takes the weekly Energy Information Agency figures and adds the governments Strategic Petroleum Reserve as done hereOil prices depend on factors outside US control such as Saudi policy and Mideast war fears Still given the tight domestic supplies the more likely direction for oil prices is up when seasonal driving demand resumes next springThe company plans to increase production at a compound annual rate of 3 through 2027 It has profitable opportunities in the Permian Basin Colorados DJ Basin Argentina the Gulf of Mexico Kazakhstan and elsewhere but limits its expansion through capital discipline It expects a free cash flow of 5 billion a year by 2025 Upstream earnings per unit are expected to grow 50 at flat prices over the next five years Chevron has a forward yield of 362 which is lower than others in the sector mainly because its stock,21,2023-10-16,7
3,Positive Momentum Is Accelerating For Oil,In our weekly US crude storage report we said that the market will likely overlook the crude build if product demand is strong This turned out to be correct with WTI now trading above 84bblLooking at the US weekly oil data positive momentum is starting to gain traction from all sides of the corners First US oil demand rebounded strongly with gasoline demand leading the wayImplied US oil demand on a 4week average basis is now above 2021 We have also seen improvement in distillate demand over the past few weeks which should calm fears about the slowdown in manufacturingOther oil which has outperformed since late last year continues to surge higher pushing total oil demand higher Jet fuel demand is also a bright spot this year with demand now moving ever closer to 2019Looking ahead we expect to see a small crude draw starting next week Crude exports are rebounding but crude imports remain elevated which has dampened the size of the drawHowever looking at the incoming crude exports and imports we see hefty draws for the remainder of August Couple this with additional SPR builds and we could easily see a scenario where US commercial crude storage drops to a 5year lowGiven that the market is forwardlooking oil prices will trade higher well in advance of the data coming out Looking at WTI time spreads the price action appears to confirm our forecastIf we are right about the crude draw then we should see WTI break above 8560 in short orderBut its not just the positive momentum we are seeing on the US side Looking at global data from Brent time spreads to onshore crude inventory changes all the signs are pointing to a healthier and stronger oil marketFor the first time this year things are looking stronger for the oil market Validation from both the demand data and the physical oil market gives us comfort that this rally is sustainable The Saudi and Russian voluntary cuts will go a long way in further tightening the market and if demand continues as is oil inventories will draw and prices will move even higherFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are interested we can help    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,62,2023-08-09,5

6,Could We See $100 Oil In 2023?,Goods things finally appear to be happening for energy bulls After languishing in mediocrity over the first half of 2023 oil prices now appear to be recovering and could well be setting up for another leg higher WTIAs it stands the fundamental outlook for the market appears quite constructive for the second half of 2023 and should these bullish factors remain in place a rally to 90bbl or even as high as 100 is not out of the questionStarting with the physical market crude oil inventories have flirted with both builds and draws for much of the year  giving little fundamental signal in theThis was the largest weekly drawdown of US crude oil inventories since the data was first recorded in 1982 And as we can see below not only does this appear bullish on an absolute basis but also on a seasonally adjusted basisFor crude oil analysing inventory changes and inventory levels provides a decent realtime proxy for the supply and demand dynamics within the market Should this record drawdown be a sign of things to come this bullish turn in inventories should continue to support prices for the months aheadIn similar fashion to changes in inventory levels the shape of the crude oil futures curve provides valuable insight to the ongoings within the physical marketAlthough the actual prices of the various futures contracts are themselves not useful predictors of future prices the shape of the futures term structure does provide valuable information into the underlying fundamentals of the oil market and is another excellent indicator of the status of the physical market GenerallyAgain similar to inventories the term structure has provided mixed signals for much of the year as it has flirted with backwardation and contangoAs it stands the curve now resides in firm backwardation across the board though not the same degree as was seen during 2021 and early 2022 Nonetheless this remains a bullish outcome for now as the market looks to be becoming increasingly tighter as we enter the second half of 2023Prompt and longerdated time spreads are also confirming this dynamic Both are sitting firmly in backwardation and confirming the recent move higher in WTIMeanwhile US crack spreads for refined products such as diesel jet fuel and gasoline have all also moved higher in line with the recent rally in crude thus confirming the tightness in the market as indicated by the backwardated term structure Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined productsFrom a positioning perspective everyone and their dog has been either short or bearish oil for quite some time now so there has been and remains still plenty of scope for a sustained positioning driven squeeze higherIndeed the managed money component of the futures market ie hedge funds and CTAs recently had their smallest exposure to oil in almost a decade as recently as early July And while their buying activity has fuelled much of the rally thus far there remains plenty of scope for speculators to drive prices higher stillLikewise total speculative positioning as a percentage of open interest remains close to favourable contrarian levels despite the recent rallyIn terms of the supply and demand outlook for oil it appears we could see deficits return to the market throughout the second half of the year if they are not already present Though I view their forecasts with a grain of salt the EIAs projections suggest global demand will exceed production by 098 mm bpd deficit in Q3 followed by an additional shortfall of 038 mm bpd in Q4Similar projections are being made by commodity analysts at Standard Chartered who  suggesting a  Likewise the IEA have also recently revised upward their demand forecasts and now predict a 17 mm bd shortfall through 2H23While demand overall still lags its preCOVID trend it has recently hit an alltime high As  by Bloomber,27,2023-08-05,5
7,Attacks On Israel Introduce Tail-Risks To Oil Prices,At the outset our thoughts and sympathies go out to those affected by the shocking attacks in IsraelThis past weekend we witnessed a severe escalationBefore these developments the ongoing talks around normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel were a key market focus given their potential implications for oil production Saudi Arabia had reportedly expressed a willingness to boost oil production if crude prices remained high This was part of a complex deal brokered by the US that aimed for Saudi Arabias recognition of Israel and a commitment to increased production The talks were under close scrutiny by investors asHowever the recent attacks have dramatically shifted these dynamics The escalating conflict has likely decreased the chances of nearterm normalization in SaudiIsraeli relations This could potentially affect Saudi oil production plans leading them to extend their existing cuts for a longer period which could further deplete already low global oil inventoriesAnother significant player in the global energy market Iran is also expected to see a major shift in US policy Before the attacks the US had adopted a softer posture toward Iran allowing it to approach pre2018 levels of oil production However given recent events and Irans known support for Hamas the US may adopt a stricter stance potentially leading to a reduction in the Iranian oil supplyThese developments underscore the real and potentially harmful risks presented by geopolitical uncertainties Persistently high oil prices could drive inflation affecting both stocks and bonds In these uncertain times assets sensitive to geopolitical events could serve as a potential hedge In particular we believe the energy sector which is intrinsically linked to geopolitics may offer an opportunityThat said the implications of recent events are only beginning to emerge and we will watch closely in the coming weeks for signs of potential direction and impact for commodities and the broader financial markets and economy 20092023 Neuberger Berman Group LLC All rights reserved ,2,2023-10-10,2
8,IEA Really Messed Up This Time,I knew something was wrong when I complimented the IEA in the July oil market report At the time IEA had published this chart for its latest oil supply  demand balance for 2024At the time we read through the assumptions and came away thinking that this was the most balanced the IEA had ever been It pointed out that China was a key tailwind for global oil demand and nonOECD will be the driver while OECD will lagThese were all very fair assumptions until this months report came out In fairness to the IEA anyone with access to the report can look at the monthovermonth change to see the assumption changes It is on page 56 for anyone interestedWhile the chart looks overwhelming I will summarize it for youThis is an important point to understand When you model global oil supply  demand balances the Q4 figure is especially important because it carries over into Q1 of the following year So in this case you will see Q4 2023 demand assumptions revised down by 600k bd This will have a meaningful effect on balances in Q4 2024 which is down 800k bd yoyPeople who are not looking at the fine print would not have noticed this startlingly downward revisionTo make matters worse IEA increased miscellaneous to balance by 500k bd for 2022 This automatically pushes the global oil balance from a deficit to a surplus The combination of 400k bd downward demand revision  500k bd of miscellaneous balance pushes 2022 balances to 500k bdThis assumption change makes about as much sense as the flat Earth theory In 2022 US total liquids with SPR saw a draw of 300 million bbls According to IEAs theory global liquids should have seen a build of 1825 million bblsSo excluding the US global liquids should have built 4825 million bblsDoes that pass the sniff test for you Yeah I thought soWhats the end result ThisNow theres another way to look at the problem we are presenting If you are the Saudis and you look at this outrageous report the IEA just produced what do you think you should do with your voluntary cut going into 2024Do you think the Saudis would just sit idle while IEA predicts a massive build in Q1 and Q2 of 2024 No of course not Perhaps the politically fueled IEA has triggered the catalyst we needed for the Saudis to extend the voluntary cut for H1 2024 Whatever the case IEAs assumption for H1 2024 wont materializeIn my years of following the oil market I have never seen such a dramatic change in the following years assumption as the one I saw today To implicitly change a historical years balance by 900k bd is one thing but to do it in the face of facts is just something else entirely And because of the downward demand revision it changes the entirety of the assumptions for this year and the following yearWhat is the purpose of this assumption change Global oil market deficit is already starting and with the Saudis now more incentivized to keep the cut throughout H1 2024 IEA has all but sowed the seeds for even lower oil inventories and even higher oil prices What they should have done instead is urge a potential supply crisis on the horizon and falsely prompt SPR responses again like it did back in March 2022 Instead they are poking the bear and prompting an entirely different responseJust because the IEA says there is a surplus doesnt make it so and by being untruthful in its reporting it is only going to make matters worse IEA screwed up royallyFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are interested we can help    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitabl,49,2023-09-14,5

10,What's Behind The Latest Bond Rate Increase?,In a stunning revolution in Republican leadership House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted as Speaker in a close 216 to 210 vote The House then took a fiveday recess and now seems adrift before electing a new leaderThe vocal minority of eight Republicans that voted to oust McCarthy is frustrated with rising federal government spending and seems to have no problem throwing a wrench into the works of federal appropriationsSince the House is in charge of drafting federal spending bills this amounts to a partial government shutdown This happened right in the middle of the debate over extending funding for the war in UkraineAt a minimum this vocal minority wants to segregate all bundled spending plans so that contentious issues like the border crisis Ukraine aid and most other spending can be thoroughly debatedIfHer attempt to tax banks with a windfall profits tax was not well received by Italys powerful business community As confidence in Meloni ebbs Italian bond yields are risingIn Italy you might argue political chaos is normal and they recycle their prime ministers regularly but in this case I think Meloni may stay in power since she is very vocal about defending Italian culture and culture tends to trump politics in ItalyIn general bond markets tend to punish countries with large budget deficits and weak leadership Alas that is where we stand now in the US too as profiled in aarticle last Thursday entitled Rising Interest Rates Mean Deficits Finally MatterIt makes the point that it is very odd for Treasury bond yields to rise when inflation is cooling and the US economy is growing The more likely culprit is rising deficits that must be financedThe good news is that no matter how dysfunctional the federal government becomes what makes America great is that our 50 states compete with each other Each state is an economic laboratory and Americans can move to prosperous states with lower taxesIt helps that the first two Presidential primaries for the 2024 election year are in states which have competed well in this 50state lowtax probusiness laboratoryAs usual the first two primaries are in Iowa January 15 and New Hampshire January 23 New Hampshire has long been the only state with no state sales tax and no state income tax while Iowas governor Kim Reynolds has lowered income tax rates on businesses and families and declared a tax surplus which she said she will return to taxpayersThe stock market trended down most of last week but investors animal spirits were lifted on Friday after an unexpectedly positive jobs report was released as well as some positive earnings reportsThe SP 500 rose 12 on Friday to help the index close the week up almost 05 However I would caution you not to overreact to the monthly jobs report as it is usually inaccurate and premature subject to large revisions in future months as well as statistical seasonal averaging to flatten out the raw statisticsLets put Fridays job total in context First ADP reported on Wednesday that only 89000 private sector jobs were created in September a number that would fall far short of Fridays totalAlso ADP said large businesses  those with over 500 employees   a net 83000 jobs while small businesses with 49 or fewer workers created 95000 jobs and those in the middle 50 to 499 employees added 72000 jobsThen on Friday the widely watched Labor Department report claimed that 336000 net new payroll jobs were created in September which was nearly double the economists consensus estimate of 170000 jobs and almost four times as many jobs as the payroll company ADP had reported two days earlierAdditionally July and August payrolls were revised higher by a cumulative 119000 jobs showing once again how unreliable their initial estimates were The rest of the key numbers were virtually unchanged from August The unemployment rate was unchanged at 38The average hourly earnings,6,2023-10-09,3

15,EOG Resources: One Of The Best Oil Stocks To Outperform The Market,This morning I was just working my way through some articles and charts I had savedOne of them is last weeks Wall Street Journal update with the title This article featured a chart that perfectly confirms what Ive communicated for roughly three years energy shareholders are in an increasingly good spotBelow were looking at the effect of oil companies deciding to focus on shareholder distributions instead of accelerating production growthRelated to this another  mentioned that the oil sectors decisions on cash utilization in the coming years have farreaching implications for US drivers and energy investorsAs the chart above shows in the past year oil executives prioritized boosting stock prices through shareholder rewards rather than investing in new drillingHowever as rising fuel costs contribute to significant inflation President Biden has called on oil companies to increase capacity leading some to redirect investments toward expansionWhile oil production is rising production is still below prepandemic levelsOn top of that US shale is losing momentum So far the Permian is the only basin expected to boost production until it might see peak production in 4Q24  as I discussed in this  among many othersAccording to  on August 14 emphasis addedThis brings me to  a stock Ive been bullish on for a while Almost three months ago I wrote an  titled  Since then EOG shares have increased 144 beating the market by roughly 13 pointsI believe that EOG is poised to reach new alltime highs soon boosted by the oil bull case The company also continues to confirm the bull case as it has deep reserves efficient production a healthy balance sheet and dedication to letting shareholders benefit from this through consistent dividend growth and special dividendsIn this article well discuss all of this and moreSo lets get to itIn light of oil price developments I believe in buying highquality oil companies with deep reserves and efficient operationsWhile buying distressed players is certainly an option I am looking for wellestablished companies that do not have major MA risks in an environment of high Tier 1 depletion risks Its why I own Canadian Natural Resources  which has more than 30 years worth of inventoryIts also why I like EOGEOG has more than 42 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves This year the company is expected to produce 986 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day Roughly half of this consists of oil This gives the company roughly 11 years of highquality reserves without any new discoveries Thats a solid number setting it apart from a lot of peersI also want companies with efficient operations not companies that will become efficient eventually Companies with efficient operations tend to be able to generate positive free cash flow even at subdued oil pricesAt elevated prices these companies turn into cash cowsCompanies that have healthy balance sheets on top of everything else tend to let shareholders benefit by distributing almost all of their free cash flow which is great for shareholdersWhile opinions differ I prefer companies that use special dividends to get rid of cash Special dividends keep companies flexible and allow investors to benefit from direct cash flows instead of indirect distributions through buybacksHeadquartered in Houston Texas EOG has major operations in the United States and Trinidad and TobagoIn the US EOG is actively investing in five premium basins a record number for the company The investments are focused on highreturn projects that contribute to lower breakeven costs and higher marginsIn the second quarter earnings call EOG explained that its assets in the Delaware Basin Eagle Ford Southern Powder River Basin Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado plays are all delivering positive resultsWell productivity and cost performance across the portfolio are meeting or exceeding expectationsF,26,2023-08-22,5

23,Energy Shock Could Pummel Equities And Bonds,The world is sleepwalking towards a destructive energy price spike that could create a resurgence in inflation weaken consumption and pummel broad equity and bond marketsThis could result in yet another bad year for the traditional balanced portfolioI believe investors should prepare for this outcome by diversifying a portion of their traditional stocksbonds allocation into more resilient hedges including oil stocksThe energy market is approaching a significant imbalance both in the short term and long term According to OPECs latest forecasts the world could see a 33 million barrel daily shortfall by Q4 of this yearCollaborative production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have successfully removed supply from the market and these cuts are expected to continue This has driven West Texas Intermediate up 33 since JuneLonger term the situation is expected to worsenJPMorgan is forecasting the oil production shortfall to reach a recordbreaking 7 million barrels daily by 2030The rationale behind this prediction is as followsAs a result JPMorgan sees production shortfalls continuing leading to higher for longer oil prices with upside price risk to 150bblOftentimes the gap between oil supply and demand is filled by tapping into reserves Today unfortunately oil reserves are significantly depletedThe depletion of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR is well telegraphed Since its peak about half of the reserve has been released in a political effort to contain inflationary pressuresLess known overall inventories excluding the SPR are also down significantly Combined this increases market sensitivity ie oil price sensitivity to supplydemand imbalancesMoreover any entity wishing to rebuild reserves must now do so at higher prices This reduces the likelihood of replenishing oil inventoriesIn contrast China continues to aggressively stockpile oil Chinas oil reserves hit  in 2022Milton Friedman once famously said  Coming out of the pandemic it is clear that Friedman was partially correct I believe money supply must be viewed in the context of physical scarcity Scarcity of labor products or resourcesEnergy is the singlemost important input into the production and distribution of goods and services Everything from the food we grow to the goods we transport is affected by the cost of energyFor this reason higher energy costs caused by supplydemand imbalances will feed into the prices of goods and services across the economy The correlation between oil price changes and headline inflation is high After lags high headline inflation feeds into core prices as higher raw materials prices electricity expenses and transportation costs are passed onto the price of finished goodsLong story short while periods of volatility are expected longrun inflation will remain above the Feds 2 targetTight oil supplies and depleted inventories can be exploited for geopolitical gain As the world becomes multipolar and the West drifts away from China and Russia this is especially importantWhile the West has sanctioned Russian oil exports in response to the Ukraine invasion Russia has successfully strengthened ties with China and India Moreover contrary to what many believe Russia is still a significant supplier of oil and gas to the EUIt doesnt require a huge stretch of the imagination to see a scenario in which Russia exploits tight global supply to gain leverage over the West It hypothetically could do so by removing another 24 million barrels from the market This would cause oil prices to skyrocket in response pushing a teetering US economy into the depths of recessionPresidencies are lost at the gas pump With a US election coming soon it is not inconceivable that Russia uses this tactic to affect the outcomeChina and India  key Russian allies  would suffer if caught off guard It is possible however that they may be coconspirators working together to ensure adeq,6,2023-09-26,1

26,USO: The Next Oil Bull Market May Have Begun,The oil market has been stuck in a relatively tight range over the past ten months The range began when I last covered the crude oil futures ETF  with a bullish longterm outlook due to the impending Since the end of June oil prices have risen sharply from 70 to over 80 per barrel causing a 20 rally for USO The rally slowed over the past three weeks as oil returned to its resistance level of 83 That said if oil breaks its pattern of falling back to 70 it would indicateIndeed that may be a reasonable outlook as oils fundamentals have turned potentially bullish If it were not for negative economic perspectives oil may be much more expensive since storage levels are low and are generally still falling However oil prices are depressed because many expect economic demand for gasoline and other oil products to decline over the next twelve months Even if the recession concerns prove correct which I believe I suspect the market is  due to recession concerns Further the oil prices are low due to depressed demand outlooks many oil producers are rapidly reducing drilling levels since oil is near or below the breakeven cost for drilling new wells in certain regionsThus oil production may fall faster than demand A potentially significant oil rally may occur due to another shortage Given much lower storage and specifically SPR inventories there is almost nothing the US government could do to stop a shortage if it returns Given  and US producers will likely cut production should the oil ever fall below 70 USO may be a great opportunity today due to its downside protection and potentially significant upsideUS oil production levels are currently the highest since COVID19 first struck the market Total US continental production spiked significantly over recent weeks likely due to efforts by companies to push products out before hurricane season ramps up and inevitably creates supply issues Thus realistically oil production remains stagnant today as it has throughout 2023 given the recent spike has come before seasonal disruptions begin However future production levels are likely to start to decline as indicated by the falling US and global rig count levels See belowSince most oil wells experience significant production declines during their first year or two a constant stream of new wells must be drilled to maintain continuous production In most circumstances there is some lag of around six months between changes in the rig count and changes to production besides extreme events such as those in 2020 where wells were forcibly shut down The US and global rig count peaked around the beginning of the year and have been falling at an accelerating pace at least in the US due to lower prices indicating US production levels should begin to wane more significantly over the coming months inventories DUCS are also very low after extremely high 2021 These wells have allowed oil producers to rapidly increase production after COVID lockdowns ended without spending significantly on new capital investments Looking forward because the supply of DUCS is lower a higher rig count should be needed to maintain constant production Of course despite a falling rig count and low drilled but uncompleted well levels the EIA believes oil production will rise in 2023 and  In my opinion the EIA may be biased because it seeks to encourage drilling to aid the governments objective of keeping gas prices low That said the EIA suspects production will continue to rise despite lower rig counts due to increases in perwell output efficiency More due to the ongoing rig count decline Crucially demand for oil services i are less interested in paying for capital upgrades to improve efficiencyAlthough the oil production outlook is essential the broader context of low inventories may be more critical I believe it is most likely that US oil production levels wane over the coming six months and potentially ,13,2023-08-28,5

38,Weekly Market Pulse: Good News Is Good News,The employment report on Friday seemed like a good one The unemployment rate was unchanged as the economy added 336000 jobs in September The gains were widespread with additions in manufacturing construction wholesale trade retail trade transportation warehousing leisure and hospitality healthcare and education and government Average hourly earningsIt was good news right Well maybe but you wouldnt know it from the initial reaction in the stock market which was decidedly negative The SP 500 traded down over 38 points  almost 1  within minutes of the opening The 10year Treasury note yield spiked higher by 17 basis points and that was the trigger for traders who for the last two months have been selling stocks on every tick higher in yields The obvious fear was that the strong report would push the Fed to hike rates more And fear beatBut as I sit here at closing time on Friday the SP 500 has staged a pretty neat reversal rising 25 from the low of the day to the high and closing 12 higher Bond yields still closed up on the day but by just 7 basis points and below the closing high of the week which came on Tuesday at 48 This is something Ive been waiting to see for good news to be taken as good news rather than as a warning that the Fed needs to inflict some more pain Jerome Powell has made it clear that he believes the economy needs to soften that more people need to lose their jobs to tame inflationExcept of course that isnt true because more people working isnt what  inflation The fact is that the inflation rate has fallen pretty dramatically over the last year with no loss of jobs on net Even if you think more people getting paid is reason to worry about inflation there was nothing of concern in this report Average hourly earnings were up just 02 which if inflation stays the same in September as it was in August would be an effective pay cut Pardon me if I fail to see how a cut in real average hourly earnings is going to spur more inflation Maybe the guy who ought to be shopping his resume  or finding a good retirement home  is Jerome PowellThe employment report was pretty good but as with most of these things it needs to be taken with a grain of salt As Ive pointed out plenty of times over the years I dont spend much time on employment reports because they are subject to big revisions While it looms large for the markets for some reason it is way down the list of economic reports I think are important I generally only pay attention to the sign  or  and I dont even trust that because an initially positive report can be revised to negative and a negative one to positive And sometimes bothOver the last couple of months those who are negative on the economy have been touting the fact that recent revisions have been negative as if that were some kind of blinding insight about the true state of the economy You wont be hearing from them on that this month though since some of the previous negative revisions were revised again July and August were up by 119k jobs wiping out the previous negative revisions Economic data revisions arewell you knowI have been waiting for good economic news to be taken positively  and I think this qualifies  because that would be an indication that interest rates are near a peak I think well be there soon or may be there now because while the 10year rate has been climbing steadily for the last two years the rate of change of nominal gross domestic product NGDP GDP not adjusted for inflation has been falling since peaking at nearly 17 in Q2 2021Why is that important Well because the 10year rate and the yearoveryear change in NGDP track each other pretty closely over time and they are converging The YOY change in NGDP last quarter was 59 and it will probably be lower again this quarter If the change is the same as last quarter it would fall to just 5 which is close enough to the 10year rate of 48 to,1,2023-10-09,3

44,InPlay Oil: Make This Play On The O&G Sector,My most recent article on InPlay Oil  was in May 2023 after Q1 2023 results were released where I made the following conclusionThe stock has unfortunately been fairly flat since I wrote on it despite the recent increases in oil and natural gas prices WTI averaged 85bbl USD is August up from 65bbl in May primarily because of extended voluntary cuts to Saudi Arabias crude oil production and increasing global demand To be fair many of the small cap producers have not benefited from the recent surge in oil prices Most Alberta producers experienced onetime drops in production in MayJune because of wildfires which the market is likely taking into accountI analyze Q2 2023 results and provide my outlookRevenue fell 44 and 31 respectively compared to the three and six months ending June 30 2022 This was in part due to production declines for the three and six months ending June 30 2023 which was 6 lower compared to Q2 2022 This was due to the aforementioned wildfires which forced IPO to halt production at Drayton Valley from May 4 2023 to May 19 2023 impacting production for the quarter by 300 boed In addition curtailments were imposed by a third party natural gas processing facility due to capacity constraints starting February 2023 impacting production by 500 boed over the second quarterThe larger contributor to the large decline was the decrease in commodity prices In Q2 2023 WTI oil prices decreased 26 averaging 7496bbl USD compared to 10135bbl USD in the first half of 2022 IPO sells oil at monthly average Edmonton Par prices less quality differentials adjusted for transportation and marketing fees Light sweet oil differentials between Cushing Oklahoma and Edmonton Alberta are affected by pipeline and railway capacity refinery turnarounds and market supplydemand conditions Monthly index differentials averaged a 308bbl USD discount for the second quarter of 2023 compared to a 050bbl USD discount for the second quarter of 2022 Monthly index differentials averaged a 298bbl USD discount for the first half of 2023 compared to a 173bbl USD discount for the same period in 2022IPOs averaged net realized price for crude oil was 9297bbl USD for the second quarter of 2023 32 lower than the second quarter of 2022 realized price of 13640bbl USD IPOs average realized natural gas sales price was 261per Mcf for the second quarter of 2023 66 lower than the second quarter of 2022 realized price of 761 per Mcf as a result of depressed natural gas prices IPOs average realized NGL price was 3373 per boe for the second quarter of 2023 44 lower than the second quarter of 2022 realized price of 5973 per boe as a result of lower realized propane price and lower butane condensate and pentane prices which track WTI pricingFortunately this large decline in oil prices was largely offset by the 40 decrease in royalties per barrel of oil or equivalent from the first six months of 2022 Production coming from new wells drilled by IPO on crown lands qualify for royalty incentives that reduce crown royalties for periods of up to 48 months from initial production depending on where commodity prices are at After which point crown royalties from these wells will be subject to the regular Alberta royalty structure Excluding the adjustments the average royalty rate would have been 125 and 150 higher respectively for the three and six months ending June 30 2023 Unfortunately operating netbacks still fell 49 and 42 respectively compared to the three and six months ending June 30 2022 The August 2023 EIA ShortTerm Energy Outlook is bullish on crude oil prices Source Oil prices hovered near threemonth highs in August on expectations that Saudi Arabia would extend voluntary output cuts into September and tighten global supply Saudi supply cuts have brought back deficits according to  adding that they see the extra Million bpd Saudi cut to last through September and,7,2023-08-21,5

48,The Fed Signals Another Rate Increase In 2023 (And No Cuts),The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC statement seemed dovish at first but then the FOMC signaled that one more Fed rate hike was not only possible but likelyA survey of the FOMC members revealed that seven membersThe FOMC statement said that they were highly attentive to inflation risks The bottom line is that the Fed remains datadependent but that means any good news like rising GDP or higher energy prices could mean another rate increaseI remain in the camp that energy is an inflation outlier so the Fed should not increase key interest rates further The housing component owners equivalent rent in the Consumer Price Index and wholesale service costs in the Producer PriceThere is nothing the Fed can do about the Presidents energy policies so I expect that the core rate of inflation will continue to moderate giving the Fed no rational reason to keep raising key interest ratesThe other reason why I do not expect the Fed to raise key interest rates is that it risks squelching the soft landing scenario it proudly engineeredOne example of high rates hurting growth is that credit card companies are now reporting a 363 default rate up from 213 two years ago in September 2021 Goldman Sachs is now forecasting that credit card losses will rise to 493 in late 2024 or early 2025In other words consumer credit is expected to continue to deteriorate heading right up through the November 2024 Presidential election Several credit card companies are based in Delaware and have supported Joe Biden for decadesThe fact that Capital One  has backed Joe Biden in the past bodes poorly for his reelection prospects since Capital One has historically had the highest default ratesAcross the pond the European Central Bank ECB has raised its key interest rate 025 to 4 the euros highest level ever In doing so the ECB signaled that fighting inflation is more important than stimulating economic growthItaly and Germany are big export economies but due to Chinas economic woes they are contracting this quarter and will likely drag the entire eurozone into a recessionInflation in the eurozone has dropped from a peak of 106 last year to 53 in August Food and energy inflation there is much more acute than in the US but there is little that the ECB can do to combat food and energy inflation so I think the ECB may have made a mistake with its latest rate increaseSpeaking of tight money Poland abruptly ceased all military aid to Ukraine to rebuild their own readiness as Poland seems increasingly worried that Russia could invade Poland next if the Ukrainian defenses failHigh rates are impacting several US industries including real estate Last Tuesday the Commerce Department reported that housing starts declined 113 in August to an annual pace of 128 million the lowest level since June 2020And the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales declined 07 in August to an annual pace of 404 million the fifth consecutive monthly declineThere is now only a 33month supply of homes for sale Existing home sales are low because most homeowners do not want to give up their low fixed mortgages Overall there seems to be no doubt that due to high mortgage rates and tight inventories existing home sales will continue to sufferCrude oil prices have risen 30 since June as fears of further supply shortages persist Last Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported that US crude oil inventories declined by 525 million barrels in the latest weekFor example Shell  halted work at its largest refinery in Europe in Rotterdam last week This will likely exaggerate the diesel shortage that has sent European prices soaring US refineries will also shut down for a while to convert to oxygenated winter gasoline blends from current summer blendsThe most likely big supply disruption in the next few months  other than another hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico  ma,10,2023-09-25,1

50,Vista Energy: Production Expansions Lead To Promising Future Growth,Vista Energy  is a Mexicanbased energy company that was incorporated in 2017 Notwithstanding the volatile nature of the oil and gas industry this Mexican companys financial statements and strategic production expansions pave the way for higher growthDuring  the company focused on increasing its good inventory and securing more evacuation capacity for its 2026 plan thereby leading to a 22 lower revenue year over year The lower revenue of 231 million in 2Q 2023 was driven by higher oil inventory and lower prices versus at the same time in 2022 Meanwhile their total production improved by 4 year over year Vista Energy is on strategic development plans to expand its productions in the following years In doing so their capital expenditures surged to approximately 596 million in TTM versus circa 480 million atFigure 1  VISTs capital structure in millionsRegarding their  it is worth noting that the management assured investors they are on track with their wells in Palo Oeste18 and Palo Oeste19 being completed in Q3 and Q4 2023 respectively Moreover by upgrading their oil treatment plan they can increase their treatment capacity by 70000 barrels of oil per day which addresses the company to the production plan through 2026 Note Vista Energy do not pay dividend yet and is focusing on its production expansions As a result free cash outflows are not likely to bring serious concerns for the company since free cash flow is normally a source of financing debt levels and shareholders returns However these expansions will be over one day thereby providing an opportunity for the company to pay dividends to its investorsAs long as we are talking about their capability of paying back their debt levels it is worth noting that although their net debt has improved the management could reach a very competitive interest rate by accessing the local debt market in Argentina As a result they have been able to reduce their average cost of debt to 3 in 2Q 2023 and prefinance their CapEx increases In addition focusing on decelerating crossborder debt from 54 of their total debt in 2020 to 22 of the debt at the end of the second quarter will reduce their probability of exposure to international risks like higher interest rates and economic constraintsOverall Vista Energys progress in drilling and completion activities will lead to the tiein of 12 wells by the end of the third quarter of 2023 These wells will accelerate the production and thus lead to higher adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023 Furthermore the management assertedWe have secured midstream and export evacuation capacity to deliver well above our 2026 production target Based on our current capacity and the contract we have in place we forecast to have 100000 barrels of oil per day of preevacuation capacity by the end of 2025As Figure 2 illustrates during recent years Vista Energy has performed astonishingly and reached over 1000 price return which is far higher than the return of approximately 31 of the SP 500 I believe that the companys performance in production expansion in the following years makes it still a profitable investment decision even if oil prices declineFigure 2 Following the recent decision of OPEC countries for further oil production cut per day by the end of this year oil prices are  to accelerate and reach 93 per barrel by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the lower global oil inventories However the prices are about to decline to 88b on average during 2024 due to the higherthanaverage oil inventories the end of the OPEC production cut agreement and lower oil demand growth As a result it is expected that oil prices will remain above 90b by next year which is still higher than recent prices of 86b on average see Figure 3 Thus Vista Energys production expansions in the following year are likely to cater to higher income and adjusted EBITDA based on favorable oil prices,4,2023-09-18,1

67,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time,1306,2023-08-14,4

71,Oil Could Hit $300 A Barrel,It has been a trope that oil is going to become an orphan asset and that its use would end and it would become an obsolete energy source This is because of the gigantic efforts to halt climate change caused by human CO2 emissions TheThe end of oil is not going to happen and the implications are hugeAccording to the IEA the International Energy AgencyChina India and Southeast Asian countries together are expected to account for three out of every four tonnes of coal consumed worldwide in 2023From  Global coal demand set to remain at record levels in 2023The IEA is not some payplay NGO it is a This implication is obvious developing countries are not going to crucify themselves on a cross of sustainability After all these years of accords dramatic predictions plans and  in the developed world  giant shifts in policy developing countries have embraced cheap energy with both hands as a guarantee of their ascendancyIts hard not to slip from being dispassionate about this situation but the magnitude of the facts speak for themselvesAs oil is a less worse source of CO2 than dirty and sometimes very dirty coal oil has no chance of becoming an orphan source of energy As developing countries grow as they will at a dramatic pace so will their thirst for energy With these countries GDP per head only a fraction of their potential their energy needs are also only a fraction of what they will be and these needs will grow in parallel with their economies Fortunately for them  and unfortunately for plans for Net Zero  there is no shortage of coal and likely never will be with enough already found for half a millenniumThis means at the very least business as usual for oil and that likely means 300 a barrelThis idea has proved rather emotive because the thought of oil at these levels brings a realisation of how much gasoline is going to cost at the pump and it sounds like a wild prediction we so often seen on the webTake a look at this chart of historic oil over the last decade or soThe simplest way to look at this chart is to see that for a period of six years 20082014 on a fouryear average oil was at or above 100 a barrelWhen you inflation adjust this for recent years you get thisThe 300 a barrel number comes from taking the 2008 high and adding on the average US energy inflation of the last 60 years You could also add the rolling inflation of the next two or three years on top for good measure but lets not worry about the exact number The time frame is threetofive yearsOnce you have decided fossil fuel consumption is not going down then all you need do is write in the inflation already baked into the world economy to have oil trade much higher than todayInvestors therefore have a simple call to make write oil off or factor into the price the impact of inflation as must be done for any commodity in the long term and then position accordingly For me it is the latter the fact this is not generally understood underlines the potential for investors Futures traders will have no problems trading this with all the fun and games available with highly leveraged contracts but for the more conservative of us sitting on Exxon  or Chevron  or the less highlypriced overseas listed Shell  BP  and Total   all of which I own  is not a difficult theme to buy in on without playing with the risks connected to companies bellow giant statusOnce upon a time the market was trusted to solve problems and when the price of hydrocarbon energy rises above the falling cost of sustainable power then coal and oil will become niche commoditiesI am happy to point out the former and work on the latter and invest accordingly  I own Shell BP and Total Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking ,868,2023-09-18,8

90,Cautiously Bullish Oil,For the most part indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish  as they have been for much of this yearOn the term structure front both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports reduced production of Saudi heavysour crudes which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline and a number of other factors the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardationMeanwhile WTI calendar spreads represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole The EIAs historically noisy estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen Regardless the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at presentWe can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above as well as looking at refined product crack spreads As we can see below gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firmClearly the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand sideSuch dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline or to reduce runs thus reducing the amount of crude they consume This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market After all refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oilThus all else equal unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the 95100 area in the near future particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lowerThough as we have seen outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic with the DubaiBrent spread a proxy for AsiaChina oil demand continuing to trend lower overall and near parityWhile the various AfricaBrent crude oil differentials also remain strong This is an important relationship to track as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell offWhile the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September Indeed if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages the picture has now turned unfavourable as we are seeing far more builds than drawsIn terms of commercial inventory levels overall total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages as do diesel stocks The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present For me to once again become uber bullish though I remain cautiously bullish persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the normIn terms of the outlook for supply and demand consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4 though to a lesser extent prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024 Although such forecasts are fu,42,2023-08-04,5

95,Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),Over most of the past year I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads I  my longterm bullish take on MarathonHowever as discussed more recently  Ive downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash  in the crack spread As such it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon considering its stock remains generally high However its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopoliticalrelated production cuts Overall investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum depending on how we calculate its forward valuationFor the most part refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly My longterm view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today That said the shortterm outlook has changed as volatility mounts raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022 However oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around 87 per barrel today Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil  Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped Marathon has retained much of its value but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income The crack spread is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs crude oil has crashed particularly for the gasoline spread See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profitLuckily Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of 32barrel to 19barrel today That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above All else being equal this 12barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of 1296 annualized 324B quarterly  have only changed marginally over this period Natural gas has also hardly changed so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathons refining marginsThe company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023 However this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathons current EBITDA See belowHistorically Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around 15 depending on changes in other operating costs Today that spread is below its typical range before COVID19 indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around 15B per quarter from its Midstream segment In comparison its refining margins can vary from negative  seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage Its refining segment EBITDA was 316B in Q2 and may be as low as 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant Combined with an expected 15B from Midstream I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at 142B given limited changes in commodity prices and volumesMarathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the  I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the ,56,2023-09-27,1

119,18% Yield Potential At $100 Oil: Why Canadian Natural Is My Favorite Oil Play,Things are developing very quickly  even quicker than I expected Almost two monthsIn this article I want to take things a bit further As most of my readers will know Ive been bullish on oil for a while Energy is the secondlargest sector in my portfolio I mainly focus on companies that are able to deliver high returns at elevated oil prices for one major reason I want to protect my portfolio against prolonged aboveaverage inflationMy thesis is built on two major pillarsThese developments have caused a significant shift in geopolitical power and put a floor under inflation Inflation in the US is on the rise again driven by energy prices I expect this to hit core inflation as well over the next few monthsMeanwhile OPEC has witnessed an opportunity to use oil supply cuts to support prices After all with US shale growth losing momentum it can now impact prices much more efficientlyFor example even the Permian the only major basin in the US capable of significant oil price growth is now seeing lower output as declining legacy production is more than offsetting gains from new wells While these numbers can rebound rather quickly estimates are that the Permian will see longterm peak production in 4Q24 further putting a lid on US shale growthIt started when oil was close to 80 Now oil is north of 90 despite a significant decline in global economic growth expectationsAlthough I expect to deal with a number of oil price corrections along the way my thesis is that once global economic growth rebounds well have to deal with tripledigit dollar oil prices on a rather consistent basisSo when I invest in oil and gas companies I am looking for a number of key characteristicsIn this article Ill discuss recent developments that have caused oil prices to rally even faster than I expected This includes the demand pictureIll also elaborate on  which in my opinion is one of the best oil stocks money can buySo as we have a lot to discuss lets get to itOver the past few weeks it feels that the bullish oil trade has become mainstreamAccording to This is offering serious challenges for the Fed and the economy in general The  reported that market participants are now hoping that 100 oil wont do much damage as the risks of something bad happening to the economy are risingAccording to the paper the escalation of oil prices has raised concerns in both Washington and Wall Street about the potential disruption to the fueldependent American economyThis situation is reminiscent of past periods when surging oil prices played a role in pushing the country toward recessionThe chart below shows that elevated energy prices have often started recessionsAs oil prices approach 100 a barrel there are differing opinions on the potential outcomes While some expect prices to rise further due to supply constraints and geopolitical factors others anticipate moderation in prices due to increased US oil productionWhile oil production growth in the future can certainly keep oil prices from exploding we are dealing with a postpeak shale environment as I already briefly discussedFurthermore demand remains very strongBloombergs energy expert  just commented on the outlook of the International Energy Agency IEA which is renowned for its global energy statistics but has a track record of inaccurate forecasts according to BlasIn its upcoming World Energy Outlook report IEAs Executive Director Fatih Birol predicts a peak in coal oil and natural gas demand before 2030However history suggests these estimates may not holdNot only is an oil demand peak hard to predict but it is even more unlikely that a peak will be followed by a quick decline in demandAccording to Mr Blas historical consumption patterns particularly in coal and potentially in oil contradict the idea of a swift descent after reaching the peakFor instance coal demand assumed to have peaked in 2013 resurged in,64,2023-09-25,1
120,Why I Believe $200 Oil Could Be In The Cards,Oil traders and analysts seem to underestimate the IsraelHamas war and its consequences for the worlds economy Indeed neither Israel nor the Gaza Strip have substantial oil reserves but there are not only two sides to the conflict The war is getting moreI have been bullish on oil for a while  on the subject wasThe map below was prepared by  The countries supporting Palestine in the conflict are marked in orange whilst the militias are marked with red dotsAs concerns Saudi Arabia initially wanted  with Israel However as  escalated between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas the SaudiIsrael deal went on ice Moreover Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a telephone call with Iran Israels opponent in the conflict to discuss the situation Simultaneously Saudi Arabia is calling both sides of the conflict to peace and is trying to find a solution In order to achieve this Saudi Arabia and the UAE met to discuss the war  Iran could be involved in the conflict This could affect the Gulf countries national security That is why they have been pressing Western allies and Israel to deescalate tensions in Gaza and lift a siege on the strip in my viewHere comes the biggest risk to the oil markets Iran  nations has shown strong support to Palestine It is highly likely to get involved in the conflict if the war intensifies Yes right now Iran is not having a war with Israel However Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein AmirAbdollahian  settlement of the situation in the Gaza Strip is becoming highly unlikely and warned Iran may take  against Israel The minister also added the country did not initially plan to engage in a military conflict with Israel if Tel Aviv did not strike Iranian territory At the same time Iran may  if Israel launches a ground operation in the Gaza Strip  the latter seems to be inevitableMoreover  with Hezbollah the military group located in Lebanon Hezbollah has vowed to escalate if Israel begins a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip which is likely and Israel said it would retaliate  The point I am making is that the situation in the Middle East might get more complicatedThe situation is not new The IsraelHamas conflict comes 50 years after the Yom Kippur War  the fourth of the ArabIsraeli wars was initiated by Egypt and Syria on 6 October 1973 on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur After that on  immediately after President Nixons request for Congress to make available 22 billion in financial help to Israel the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries OAPEC implemented an oil embargo on the US and started cutting their oil production This made the global oil prices surge nearly fourfold The prices rose from 290 a barrel before the embargo to 1165 a barrel in January 1974 In March 1974 amid disagreements within OAPEC on how long to continue the punishment the embargo was officially lifted The oil prices however still remained highI believe something similar might actually happen now Although I doubt OPEC may implement an oil embargo a potential war between Israel and Iran may lead to massive supply cuts As can be seen from the map above Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz also known as the Gulf The Gulf is used to transport oil coming from the Middle East most notably from countries like Saudi Arabia Iraq UAE and Qatar If there is a fullscale war Iran might well close the Strait of Hormuz for all ships Unfortunately there are limited options to bypass the Gulf Moreover the very fact that there is a war in one country in the Middle East can disrupt oil production in the neighboring countries Nowadays missiles are fired and infrastructure gets destroyed So there is a big risk as wellYou might be wondering why I say that such a high oil price is well possible But let us have a look at the history of oil prices in generalThe diagram below shows the oil prices adjusted for inflation If before the Yom Kippur War th,26,2023-10-24,2

129,My View Of Wall Street: A Disturbing Macro Scene,It is no secret that many of theSpeaking of a challenge the Fed has been left with a nearimpossible task They are trying to come up with a solution that measures the right amount of restraint needed to bring inflation back was once believed to be a temporary issue beginning in 2021 but the inflation rate defied those forecasts and climbed until reaching a peak in March 2022 The Fed says it is determined to get it back to the 20 mark but it does not   some four years after inflation began to move higher Weve already seen the effects Higher prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services  gasoline food shelter cars hotel room rates and restaurantsThese price increases arent going away anytime soon It would be foolish to believe we wont see this issue having an impact well into next year and perhaps well beyond that The Feds goal is 2 but getting inflation back down to the 20 mark is not good enough  to counter some of the cumulative buildup from the longlasting runup in inflation The Fed will surely stay on course higher for longer but they are once again stuck I doubt the Fed can loosen the reins even after inflation hits its target as they will have to wait until this runup in inflation is reversedInflation spares no one It erodes the consumers purchasing power Unfortunately the ones hurt the most are those at the lower end of the income scale and those relying on a fixed income They cannot easily avoid rising food and energy prices and higher rent which consume a very large portion of their takehome pay The warnings were there Excessive and as it turned out all of the added unnecessary spending to right an economy that was already right may remain a problem that can haunt the MACRO scene for a whileI do not agree with some market pundits assessments that the economy is less interest ratesensitive than it has been in the past Their claim is relatively speaking interest rates are not high when compared to history They have a point but that argument stops there Weve seen how equities  reacted to any movement in the 10year treasury note Its been the speed of these increases that kills their argument If that isnt enough after years of zero interest rates the market will t but this adjustment period will take time There is also another unknown that not many are talking about We have a large contingent of money managers and investors who have never been invested in a stock market where interest rates are moving higher How they are reacting and how they will act when rates dont come down tomorrow is yet to be determinedSo as a result I think it is premature to predict a soft nonrecessionary landing and all systems go for a rousing BULL market With multiple headwinds building on the horizon a recession is more likely How mild it is remains unanswered However if the Fed loses its patience or overstays its welcome some believe they already have the downturn could be more protracted than some of the forecasters expect Ill note that the forecasters referred to in the last statement have dwindled to a scant fewWhat drives the US economy is Consumer spending which makes up nearly 70 of the GDP With the strong labor market good wage improvements and all the pandemic stimulus they could ever want consumers have danced their way through the Feds aggressive rate hikes and higher borrowing costs However there are a few reasons why we can expect things to change For starters the labor market is softening Second excess savings from the pandemic are swindling so consumers no longer have a cushion to support their spending Third with student loan payments set to resume on October 1 likely to subtract 04 from consumer spending in 24 and gas prices rising as oil prices move higher from 68bbl to 90bbl consumers should have less discretionary income to spend going forward There is a positive they do have a job and as l,262,2023-10-14,3

137,There Is Way Too Much Misinformation On U.S. Oil Production,Thanks to the EIAs new quest of eliminating the adjustment factor people are now completely misunderstanding US oil productionIn EIAs latest weekly oil storage report it rebenchmarked US weekly oil production higher by 300k bd For those of you who areBut at the start of the year the new EIA administrator following months of scrutiny on the unexplainable elevated adjustment figure decided to embark on a study to identify why the adjustment is so high During this study period it found that transfers to crude oil and underreported US crude production were factors that contributed to elevated adjustmentFrom what weve seen so far in the monthly reports roughly 500k bd to 600k bd are attributed to transfers to crude oil while the remainder was attributed to underreported productionTaking all this into account our methodology of always using the adjustment to calculate real supply in the US was unchanged by this methodology change from the EIAYou can see this in our oil production matrixNow you will notice that bluedotted line going straight up Thats the EIA attempting to explain away the ridiculous weekly adjustment figureBut we want you to take a closer look at our production matrix If you go all the way back to May 2018 you will notice the closely fitted lines amongst all of the things we track By 2019 there was a separation between reported US oil production EIA 914 and the EIA 914  adjustment figure Thats when transfers to crude oil became a much bigger thing which in our view is likely what caused adjustment to start becoming so elevatedIn fact the adjustment became such a big issue that we started incorporating plant condensate or our version of the adjustment into our weekly US crude storage estimates And since weve started tracking this it averaged 500k bd from 2018 to 2023But this is where things get really interestingIf you look at our modified adjustment we only separate out actual imports and exports to what EIA reports But if US oil production is structurally underreported then our modified adjustment will be elevated regardless Similarly with the methodology change that the EIA has adopted our modified adjustment will become structurally lower going forward Netnet there wont be any real change to the supply side since all of this has been included from the beginningSo to summarize EIAs attempt at solving the mysteries of the adjustment factor is leading the public to believe that theres been a major surge in US oil production when in fact its the exact oppositeNow lets talk about the fun stuffIn our latest associated gas production update weve seen a meaningful drop in production You will notice that this is in stark contrast to what we are seeing on the crude production sideIn addition if we look at our highfrequency US oil production tracking we dont see it making a new high by yearendIn essence we dont expect US oil production to push higher going forward Without an uptick in associated gas production EIAs own adjustment figure is going to tip into a consistent negative which will suggest that US oil production is overstated at 132 million bdBeware of oil tourists talking about how US oil production increased 12 million bd from the end of last year to today They dont know what they are talking aboutThe reality is that US oil production is growing but because we are comparing apples to oranges yoy comparisons become irrelevant when discussing US oil production going forward You can thankblame the EIA for that oneThank you for reading this article We launched our oil trading portfolio in 2019 The oil trading portfolio is designed to take advantage of shortterm longshort oil and energy stock trades in the market For readers interested in our positioning along with realtime trades    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being giv,19,2023-10-20,5

160,Transocean: May Soar By 200% In The Next 36 Months,Transocean s stock is struggling to get past the 9 resistance line But if everything goes the way it is going now then the stock may trade well in the double digits as soon as this year In fact Here are a few quotes from the  where Jeremy Thigpen Transoceans CEO summarizes the contract awards of the past quarterIn the UK a contract was signed at a rate of 175000 per day adding approximately 175 million to the companys backlog So far Brazils day rates seem to be the best So from this release we can clearly see that the contracts were concluded at reasonably high rates and in different regions of operation But most importantly in the past quarter alone 13 billion in new backlog was added which is really substantial Soon after the earnings conference call two more contracts were announced The first one was the 222M ultradeepwater drillship contract awarded by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd for the  for work offshore India The second one was a 486M contract for the Deepwater Aquila drillship All this signals a clear improvement in Transoceans business activityIn addition to the new contracts announced the company also issued some debt Transocean Aquila Limited Transoceans wholly owned indirect subsidiary commenced a private offering of 300M of senior secured notes due 2028 In other words RIG had to borrow money to afford Aquila the new build But I do not think the debt load increase will be that significantIn order to have a better idea of Transoceans debt situation let us have a look at the companys debt history The data were obtained from Morning Stars websiteIf we have a look at Transoceans total liabilities these were substantially lower in 2Q 2023 compared to the year 2020 As concerns the companys total debt it has been falling since 2020 So the general picture seems to be improving Even if the debt load rises by 300 million nothing horrible will happen it seems Not to mention that Aquila the new asset will generate cash flows and revenuesTransocean has been criticized for having too many coldstacked rigs But it does not mean these coldstacked rigs will have to be recycled Rather the opposite is true  its coldstacked rigs by bidding them on open tenders or through direct negotiations Transocean has 10 coldstacked ultradeepwater rigs and 1 harsh environment semisubmersible Interestingly 8 of these vessels are highly demanded sixth and seventhgeneration drillships Globally there are just 12 of these coldstacked vessels and 4 stranded new builds that are now owned by anyoneThe market for offshore drilling equipment is currently far too tight whilst it takes years to construct an ultradeepwater ship and also plenty of money investments Even if we assume the budget to reactivate a deepwater or an ultradeepwater drillship is above 75125 million it will still be substantially lower compared to the amount of money used to construct say the new 7th generation drillship Deepwater Aquila So apart from the warmstacked or active rigs coldstacked drillships can still potentially be reactivated and used to generate cash flows and revenues According to one of the recent Transocean  buying and activating a stranded shipyard asset could result in an investment of 300  500 million substantially more than any reactivation of any coldstacked shipIn my recent article I wrote quite for the oil prices this coming winter The fossil fuel markets in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere in general are very tight and more is yet to come it seems I absolutely agree that offshore drillers invest for the long term Seasonal oil price fluctuations are not a very good reason to invest in costly offshore exploration of course However if the oil markets remain tight the supply stays low and green energy sources do not manage to become a perfect alternative to fossil fuels in the next several years then oil majors will keep investing in offsh,98,2023-10-03,1

167,The Bullish Case For Oil Is Still Compelling,Not since November of last year have we seen oil prices where they are today We are close by far to the highest pricing that crude has traded at all year As of this writing WTI crude for instance is at 9118 per barrel Not surprisingly Brent crude isThe last article that I published that covered the oil market generally came out in early April of this year At that time I was talking about the new OPEC production cut and how that represented a massive gift to the oil sector Normally when I talk about investing I like to identify individual companies that should rise or fall materially But when it comes to the oil patch there are many different types of companies to choose from with each one having a significantly different risk vs reward payoff compared to the others For some investors it just makes it easier to buy into an ETF that appreciates if oil prices rise or drops if they fallBack then the ETF I chose as the primary emphasis for my article was   But there are plenty of others to choose from each one with its own positives and negatives Examples include           and   To be clear investors would be wise to evaluate each of these ETFs individually to see which one best fits their own investment preferences and risk appetite But in general one thing that these all should have in common is that as oil prices rise they should appreciate This should be true at least in the short termRegardless of the vehicle that each individual investor chooses to play in the oil market a case could be made by some that prices are too high and should drop from here Theres certainly data to support that view Take data provided by the EIA for instance In its most recent ShortTerm Energy Outlook which was published earlier this month the agency calculated that for 2023 global oil supply would come in at about 10118 million barrels per day This would be about 021 million barrels per day higher than the 10097 million in consumption that would be experienced This disparity might not seem like much to some investors But it could have a major impact on global oil markets if true The total excess supply spread over a single year would be 7665 million barrelsNow its important to point out that just because inventories are rising that this shouldnt necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on oil It all depends on how much crude already is out there Generally the range that should be considered healthy for the environment would be between 55 and 60 days worth of supply of crude in OECD nations Whenever this number starts ticking above 60 we start to drift into bearish territory Based on the STEO report issued by the end of this year we should be at roughly 6057 days worth of supply for OECD nations That would translate to excess crude amongst developed nations of 26 million barrels To make matters worse the 2024 calendar year should see global demand of 10288 million barrels per day Thats 055 million barrels per day higher than the 10233 million barrels per day of consumption that has been forecasted That would translate to 20075 million barrels of additional crude throughout the year with OECD inventories climbing to 284 billion barrels or 6214 daysLooking at the most recently available weekly  we see that domestic crude inventories for the US excluding whats in the SPR Strategic Petroleum Reserve are about 127 billion barrels Thats an increase over the 123 billion barrels of crude seen one year earlier However if we include the SPR into the picture domestic inventories would have declined from 165 billion barrels to 162 billion This is because in order to combat high oil prices the US has drained a lot of the oil in the SPR taking inventories from 4226 million barrels last year to 351 million this yearSo to summarize what we have on the bearish side of the equation is the EIA forecasting continued growth in production that,1,2023-10-17,5

170,"XLE: Crude Oil Goes Boom - Protect Yourself, Buy Energy",On April 20 I wrote an  titled  In that article I made the case to buy energy stocks to be protected from what could become aHeres a part of my takeawaySince then the Energy ETF  has rallied roughly 11 beating the SP 500 by 300 basis pointsNow its time for an update Not only have I written countless articles on various energy stocks updating my bull case but weve also seen a confirmation of my thesisAfter breaking out in July crude oil futures are back at 90 Thats despite poor consumer confidence and a general downtrend in economic growthIn this article Ill discuss the drivers of this bull case and explain why I continue to believe that owning energy stocks is so importantSo lets get to itLike every other commodity oil is all about supply and demandThe supply picture is what worries me meaning it could cause high inflation for many years to come because major basins in the US are running out of steamAfter the Great Financial Crisis US shale production was the reason why global oil prices were subdued most of the time especially after 2014 In 2007 the US produced roughly 500 thousand barrels of oil per day using unconventional measures horizontal drilling Now that number is 8 million barrels per day higherThis annoyed OPEC a lot It even annoyed US producers as they were producing so much that every decline in demand caused oil prices to crashSo many smaller players went bust in the past few yearsNow things are changing US shale is running out of stream Were not seeing peak oil but a significant decline in supply growth Producers are seeing rapidly declining Tier 1 drilling reserves They focus on free cash flow generation instead of production growth and reward investors through dividends and buybacksThey have learned their lesson  especially in an environment where new climate movements want to put big oil out of businessAs the chart above shows shale production is barely higher than it was prior to the pandemic The only basin with growth left is the Permian the big oneEven that basin is expected to reach peak production in 4Q24With the US losing pricing power OPEC is witnessing a chance to become more powerfulOne of the reasons why oil is back at 90 is aggressive output cuts from OPEC mainly Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants to protect 80 Brent at all costs It also seems to be willing to defend 90 Brent given that they announced an extension of the cutsBecause of the supply squeeze were dealing with an increasing supply shortfall pushing up pricesWe can assume that OPEC is likely playing a political game here While Im obviously not a political insider who knows what for example the Saudis are up to I can imagine what they are doing hereLooking at the chart below we see that crude oil storage levels in the US are way below anything weve seen over the past five years and before thatIncluding the strategic reserves reserves are more than 200 million barrels below their longerterm average Also were going into a major election year I doubt Biden  or any Democrat  wants to buy back oil in this environmentHaving said that demand developments are also favorableAs reported by  on September 14 forecasts from leading energy analysts suggest that global crude oil consumption is on an unstoppable ascentThe International Energy Agency IEA projects a recordbreaking 1022 million barrels per day for this year with a relentless climb to 1057 mbd by 2028Exxon Mobil  also anticipates demand to surge by roughly 75 mbd until it peaks in 2040Whats interesting is that the IEA do not confuse this with the EIA isnt that bullish Its outlook includes barely any demand growth through 2028They do not expect 2018 levels to be reached before 2025 as most consumption is expected to come from natural gas liquids and biofuelsAccording to Bloombergs David Fickling we could be looking at a peak demand scenario for crude oil,91,2023-09-15,5

193,Cenovus Energy: Cash Drain Ending,  made a few acquisitions that resulted in a bunch of onetime expenditures  also began operations whileCenovus Energy has a cash flow advantage over many competitors because the thermal business often requires a relatively large cash investment first before production begins Therefore there is a depreciation component that protects cash flowCenovus management appears to have determined that some cash flow will be used to grow the company business That decision is part of the free cash flow calculation used to determine the cash available to return to shareholders Investors need to remember that Free Cash Flow is not GAAP or any other accounting standard Therefore the calculation of Free Cash Flow can and in fact does vary among companies This should be expected when there is no formal standard That means Free Cash Flow is often not comparable until the numbers are reviewed and adjusted for an apples to apples comparisonObviously the debt progress came to a grinding halt when the acquisitions were made But management remains focused enough to resume progress as shown aboveRising prices of commodities should help that forward progress But so will the transition of cashusing assets to cash generating assetsLonger term the acquired refining assets need to be optimized to maximize the profits of the combined company That means that the refining and upgrading process will need to handle more thermal oil production in the future while turning that oil into profit maximizing products Given that the market price relationships can change due to supply and demand imbalances this demands a flexible manufacturing processThe  be thought of as a starting point The same can be said for current utilization rates and other key production figures that help to determine overall profitabilityThe main goal is to avoid periods of thermal oil pricing weakness that decimated results in the past before there was more refining capacity Some products like asphalt could well reflect thermal oil pricing weakness even though they are value added because the primary source of asphalt is a discounted productOthers like gasoline can also be made from light oil and therefore are likely to have a sales price that holds up better during times of weak commodity prices during a cyclical business downturn cycleThis process will likely take years rather than happen overnight That implies a gradually widening corporate margin when compared to the past under similar conditions Given that commodity prices fluctuate all the time this is the kind of progress that shareholders find hard to see happeningThe other thing is that the acquisition of more refining capacity over the last few years means that there is a switch in suppliers to the Cenovus thermal production This can be traumatic for the refining business as well because thermal supplies can vary Sometimes the variation is so great that capital expenditures to the refinery are required Therefore using Cenovus products at the acquired facilities may take some time in addition to taking the time needed to maximize profits using this supply sourceLong term there is still a very clear need for more refining capacityAs can be seen above there is still a fair amount of production that is exposed to commodity prices because there is no downstream capability for that excess production Clearly management can make money on that production selling it at commodity pricing or they would not produce it in the first placeBut longterm enhanced profitability will likely happen through the expansion of downstream capabilities Management has noted some debottlenecking opportunities But left unsaid is that management is probably opportunistically shopping for a refinery or two that can fit the corporate organizationWhile the company has made considerable progress there is clearly still a lot of potential upside in the optimizing profits processIn addition to the previous d,62,2023-09-01,6

199,Phillips 66: Crack Spread Decline Lowers EPS Estimate By Over Two-Thirds (Rating Downgrade),Over the past year I have held a bullish view of refinery stocks specifically Phillips 66  Refineries have outperformed the energy sector due to the rise in the price of gasoline and other refined products comparedMy  the crack spread will be permanently elevated compared to pre2020 levels until gasoline is phased out of  vehicles potentially giving Phillips 66 over a decade of significant returns This longterm outlook is based onOf course potential profit margins on oil refining have declined dramatically since August Philips 66 and its peers have hardly declined in value Thus refinery stocks may be significantly overvalued on a shortterm basis To better determine that we must look more closely at the core causes of the crack spreads volatility and how it may impact Phillips 66 on a shortterm basisSince 2020 oil production and refinery capacity utilization volatility have led to immense crack spread changes The crack spread is often measured as the difference between a barrel of twothirds RBOB gasoline plus onethird Heating Oil minus one barrel of crude oil There are 42 gallons per barrel To simplify I will show both on a 11 basis however the spread between RBOB and oil is generally more critical for Phillips 66s profits than the heating oil spread See belowThe gasoline spread is back in its 10year average range falling by over 50 over the past three months Conversely the heating oil spread which as a distillate is more telling of diesel fuel is back at its high range Overall the 321 crack spread which measures both together is down by over onethird over  the initial 2022 spike Accordingly aside from hedging and other sources of income this data implies Phillip 66s EPS will soon be back near its 2021 levelsThere are multiple causes for the boom and bust in the crack spread For one refinery capacity utilization was generally low earlier this year but strengthened dramatically over the summer improving the gasoline supply The manufacturing PMI has slipped over the past two years indicating a slowdown and contraction in industrial activity Further refinery capacity utilization has also fallen pointing toward a potential decline in gasoline demand See belowNotably the US  miles traveled is still around 25 below the preCOVID peak similar to 2018 Vehicle usage has increased throughout 2023 but remains just below preCOVID levels while gasoline production and products supplied are generally at 2019 levels These data indicate a small glut may have developed in the gasoline market over the past two monthsThat said total stocks of both gasoline and distillate fuels remain below average today Total petroleum product exports are also very high though they have declined marginally over the past two months See belowWith fuel exports high and inventories low there remains the significant possibility that gasoline will fall back into a shortage The price of crude oil has also risen dramatically over the past two months due to  that market creating higher costs for Phillips 66 The shortterm outlook for the companys refining margins is bearish due to the low crack spread today However there have been no evident fundamental supply changes such as dramatically improved refining infrastructure investments or a sharp increase in inventories that would point toward a prolonged glut Most likely the current small surplus is caused by a decline in gasoline demand associated with the economic trendFrom a longerterm standpoint were also seeing a massive increase in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles Interestingly there is a relatively strong correlation between the sales of these types of cars and the price of gasoline As gasoline becomes more expensive more people buy these more efficient vehicles to save costs See belowStrong EV sales are also promoted by a marked 19  vehicle prices over the past year partly due to overproduction and growing ,18,2023-10-04,5
200,Marathon Petroleum: Elevated Crack Spreads And Share Repurchases Make This Attractive,Marathon Petroleum  was started in 1887 with the combining of several smaller oil companies in the Lima Ohio region When the company combined the new company was called the Ohio Oil Company and was foundedBy 1888 Standard Oil already controlled most of the Lima Oil Field and was the primary company that transported oil from the Lima Oil Fields to Chicago and other cities In 1889 like it did with so manyFast forward to 1911 when the Standard Oil Company was broken up thanks to the antitrust laws at the time The separation finalized in 1913 and The Ohio Oil Company was once again an independent companyIn 1930 The Ohio Oil Company acquired the Transcontinental Oil Company which had a brand name called Marathon with a slogan that stated The best in the long run The 1940s and 1950s was a very innovative time period for oil and gas companies and The Ohio Oil Company was one of the leading companies in innovation and then in 1962 the company officially changed its name to the Marathon Oil CompanyUp until 2011 the Marathon Petroleum Company operated upstream assets as well as downstream assets However in 2011 the company chose to spin off its upstream assets into a separate company called the Marathon Oil  and became named the Marathon Petroleum Company Therefore Marathon Petroleum Company only consists of downstream assets such as refineries and pipelines todayThe outlook for the refining business remains very strong through 2023 In 2022 the business experienced some of the highest crack spreads in recent history You can see below that the spreads jumped over 120 when historically they hover around 40The EIA for what it is worth  that crack spreads will normalize once again over the coming years Their forecast for after 2023 is shown after the gray dotted line Will this happen I would be skeptical if this can return to what it was prior to the pandemic but time will tellHere is what crack spreads have actually done throughout 2022 Throughout 2023 crack spreads have remained elevated in the range of 80 per gallonThe EIA forecasts that refinery utilization will remain in the 90 percent range in the future just as it has in the past In other words the industry is operating at full capacity and there isnt going to be any meaningful new refining capacity coming online any time soon In 2022 Biden approved a large export terminal for the Gulf Coast but it doesnt appear there is new refining capacity only the ability to The last large scale refinery to come online was in 1977 and was the Marathon refinery in Garyville Louisiana It came online with 200000 barrels of capacity and has around 600000 barrels per day of capacity today Since then no new refineries have opened that produce greater than 50000 barrels per day New refining capacity does not appear to be a threat to Marathons businessMarathons business remains strong I would say the industry and Marathon are wellpositioned for the future Given the regulatory environment that is engulfing the oil and gas industry it should provide large refiners like Marathon with a competitive moat for years to comeSince spinning off the Marathon Oil Company MPC has operated with anywhere between 500 to 600 million shares outstanding For the past two years the company has been aggressively buying back shares This is going to continue to be a bullish signal for Marathon In 2019 the company had about 664 million shares outstanding Today the company has reduced that by over a third down to roughly 400 million shares outstanding They were able to reduce shares since the end of 2022 from above 500 million to where it is today Yeartodate as of this writing the companys shares are up over 30 percentThis has been a good strategy for the growth of the share price However with interest rates continuing to rise I would think that capital deployed towards share repurchases becomes a much less effective use of capital an,16,2023-09-06,5
201,Exxon Mobil: Superior Asset Base And Execution To Fuel Returns Throughout The Cycle,Looking at Exxon Mobils financials and operations the company is undeniably in a better spot than it was 10 years ago Following the decline in oil prices due to US shale overproduction and especially since the onset of the Covid19 pandemic and subsequent crash in oil prices management has shifted its strategic focus away from an expansionatallcosts mode to aThis shift becomes evident when looking at the proportion of CAPEX to total cash generated by operating activities CFO Especially the years 2013 and 2014 saw a CAPEX to CFO ratio more than 3x that of 2022 and 2023 in a comparable oil price environment Another key point to highlight is the spike during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020 which is part of managements countercyclical spending approach as despite the sharp decline in cash flow it did not cut CAPEX to the extent that peers did This spending was to a large degree concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico as capital spending was redirected from supporting producing assets due to low oil prices to the buildup of new assets as countless new idle wells were drilled While presenting a risk to the companys debt position in the short run this strategy reaped huge benefits for the Exxon Mobil as those wells could be quickly setup for full operations during the subsequent recovery and spike in oil prices with CFO growing more than more than 4x from FY20 to FY22 opposed to peers average of 23xAlongside the Permian Basin XOM currently focuses its capital and exploration expenditures on developing its operations in the Starbroek Block off the coast of Guyana which together with the companys assets in the Permian yielded a combined production of c09 Mboed or 24 of total as of FY22 These key strategic growth projects which also include Exxons LNG and Brazilian operations account for c70 of total CAPEX and are initiated at 10 and 15 respective IRR hurdle rates at 35bbl Brent while capital spending on other legacy assets is largely comprised of maintenance to keep production stable with targeted divestments of highcost projects As part of its Q2 23 earnings call management stated that the companys wells in the Permian and Guyana deliver 2x of unit earnings compared to divested ones highlighting the effect this decision will have on Exxons productions costs per barrel in the long runWith managements production targets of c12 Mboed in Guyana c1 Mboed in the Permian and around 405 kboed of Liquefied Natural Gas LNG author estimated growth at 3 pa as well as an assumed decline in nonstrategic assets production of c5 CAGR over the period I estimate Exxons total output to grow at 43 CAGR to c46 Mboed by FY27 Management has also included Brazils Bacalhau field in their strategic growth projects estimating it to add c220 kboed however as Exxon has  a failure to find oil there I have excluded it from my forecasts This shift towards higherreturn and lowercost assets which I estimate to comprise more than 50 of total production by FY27 is the first pillar of managements business plan to bring down breakeven costs to an industryleading 30bbl from 37bbl as forecasted for FY23In my opinion this will not only benefit Exxon in terms of pure costs but also make the company more agile and flexible to react to changes in oil demand and price Especially in the Permian the production of these shortcyclebarrels can be brought up quickly in a favorable price environment and equally quickly be shut down in an unfavorable environment Management estimates that by FY27 28 of the companys total production base will be comprised of such assets which I view as a key advantage in times where oil cycles seem to get shorter and shorter with oil trading as low as 20bbl to as high as 120bbl in the span of less than 3 yearsAs second pillar of its plan to produce oil at 30bbl by FY27 management has also undertaken several internal initiatives t,7,2023-10-21,4
202,Petrobras: Q2 Earnings Confirm Deteriorating Outlook,In  on Petrobras   I took a neutral view of the stock due to several yellow flags surrounding the company particularly concerning the appointment of a former politician as Petrobras new CEO and stateThe flow of negative news for Petrobras especially with the company being influenced by political measures such as subsidizing the price of gasoline in Brazil has led me to maintain my cautious stance Despite the companys attractive valuation compared to private and stateowned peers the lack of clarity regarding its future direction makes me skeptical about entering into Petrobras sharesThe recent Q2 results were disappointing and the trend suggests that Q3 performance may be even worse due to the companys subsidies on fuel prices The gasoline subsidies have already resulted in nearly R 10 billion in losses with an average subsidyAlthough Petrobras has been considered a robust dividend payer I believe this positive outlook could now be in jeopardy As a result I struggle to adopt any stance other than being bearish about the companys futurePetrobras recently reported that its board of directors had approved a new  reducing the percentage of free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous 60 to 45The companys investment cash flow for the upcoming years is still uncertain Petrobras has not yet released its investment plan which is expected to be disclosed along with the strategic plan 2024 and beyond in the coming monthsOver the last five years Petrobras achieved an average operating cash generation of approximately R 160 billion annually while the average cash flow from investments was R 40 billion Half this amount was allocated to maintaining operations while the other half went to growth and new business lines approximately R 20 billion eachBased on this historical data the average free cash flow in recent years was around R120 billion suggesting that Petrobras would have distributed R54 billion under the new dividend policy This would result in an average dividend yield of 128 Consequently those who received super dividends of over 20 in the past year may not expect a similar payout this yearLooking ahead I believe that Petrobras will probably continue to maintain yields in the double digits However there remains uncertainty regarding the companys investment program for the coming yearsPetrobras has recently undertaken an extensive divestment program selling refineries to private companies to increase cash flow and promote competition However with the current Workers Party government in Brazil there are indications that this process could be reversed potentially pausing sales to expand refining capacityFurthermore increased spending and past management under the Workers Party President Lulas party have raised concerns about irregular investments as  by Operation Car Wash and the Brazilian Federal Court of AccountsI believe Petrobras Q2  left something to be desired primarily due to the companys new commercial orientation despite presenting reasonable operational impactsRegarding the companys financial performance there were notable highlights Revenues dropped by 18 YoY to R113 billion due to the fall in Brent prices lower export revenues and reduced refining margins The Exploration  Production segment also saw a decline in revenues totaling R729 billion down 325 YoY primarily influenced by the drop in oil pricesEBITDA in the second quarter amounted to R499 billion compared to R785 billion in the same quarter of the previous year Recurring consolidated EBITDA stood at R567 billion and recurring free cash flow operating cash flow minus investments reached R33 billion with R78 billion related to nonrecurring divestmentsInvestments increased to 32 billion in Q2 2023 compared to 21 billion in Q2 2022 with 802 of this amount directed towards the Exploration  Production segment aligning with the company,42,2023-08-07,5

Valero Energy: One Is A Buy, And One Is Not",In the last 60 days the refining segment has seen strong gains So much so that  have downgraded the entire group based mainly on valuation and risk ofThe viewpoints expressed at Bank of America make sense on the surface After a nice run and the continuance of historically high crack spreads the group could take a beating if margins regress to historical levels However all refiners are not created equal In fact when looking at the three biggest refiners in the US Marathon Valero and Phillips 66 you will find three different business structuresIn this article I will discuss two refiners Phillips 66  and Valero As a whole the refinery industry has gotten smaller since the pandemic Total refinery capacity has actually shrunk to 2014 levels as a result of under investment in the industry  We are now entering the hangover period from the pandemic The pandemics sudden shock to the industry has resulted in refiners closing up shop and those who stayed in business put off large maintenance projects to stay afloat This has shifted the supply and demand balance resulting in higher rates for refiners These new rates have allowed refiners to post outstanding numbers over the last 1218 monthsSince greenfield refineries arent exactly appealing in the public eye and electric vehicles are becoming more ingrained in the transportation industry the industry has shifted its investment focus The big players are now focusing growth initiatives on renewable diesel for both its environmental and economic benefitsTo that end several companies aim to start up renewable diesel projects to capture the high margins that are offered by renewable credits more on that later for producing renewable diesel Below are some of the notable renewable diesel projects in the worksAs with most things the market takes some time to respond to these incremental changes Currently the EIA projects the 321 crack spread to remain elevated for 2023 before settling back to a slightly elevated level by 2024Does all of this point toward the demise or at least regression of the refinery sector Lets dive in to VLO and PSX to find outVLO is a moderately sized company with a market cap of 46 billion just a bit smaller than PSX 50 billion VLO is also a highly visible brand with its logo on top of over 7000 gas stations nationally VLO also has 15 refineries and a renewable fuels segment The renewable fuels group consists of two renewable diesel facilities and 12 ethanol plantsWhen I look at Valeros  I see a lot of discussion points regarding their renewable diesel technology the Green Diamond Diesel brand and ethanol production These could easily be dismissed as admirable endeavors with minimal possibly negative economic value As with any renewable initiative in an investing format the measuring stick will always be how much green it can generate and how do these assets stack up against traditional refineriesBelow you will find Valeros Q2 10K report You can see that after impressive growth from 2022s numbers the renewable diesel and ethanol groups accounts for 12 of the companies operating income up from approximately 5 in 2022 While not an overwhelming number it is certainly a contributing factor to the companys bottom lineIn my opinion the VLO investor presentations do a poor job representing the renewable fuels potential To get our facts straight I like to put my engineer hat on and let the numbers speak for themselves The table below displays overall profitability for each segment Based on the above data is it very evident that the renewable fuels fetch a considerable premium compared to conventional refining although at much smaller volumes Before we jump on the renewable bandwagon we need to understand how renewables are incentivized and what risks are involvedDiamond Green Diesel is VLOs brand for renewable diesel In the 4th quarter of 2022 VLO completed its third DGD unit at Port ,41,2023-09-04,7

207,HF Sinclair Appears Fairly Valued Right Now,Just like all the refiners   has greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis Thanks to the skyhigh refining margins that have resulted from the war in Ukraine the company posted record earnings last yearJust like all the US refiners HF Sinclair incurred excessive losses in 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis which caused a collapse in the global demand for oil products However thanks to the reopening of the global economy the company recoveredEven better HF Sinclair has greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine in early 2022 the US and the European Union imposed strict sanctions on the exports of refined products from Russia As this country provided 10 of global oil output and an even greater share in the global markets of diesel and gasoline refining margins skyrocketed to unprecedented levels last year As a result HF Sinclair posted record earnings per share of 1473 last year To provide a perspective the previous record of the company was earnings per share of 644 in 2018Refining margins somewhat moderated off blowout levels in the first half of this year but they remained far above normal levels As a result HF Sinclair reported earnings per share of  in the first half of the year and is expected by analysts to achieve earnings per share of 1006 in the full year If the refiner meets the analysts consensus it will post the secondbest earnings per share in its historyIt is also important to note that HF Sinclair is one of the highestquality refiners in the country thanks to its exemplary management Some oil companies such as Exxon Mobil  curtailed their growth projects in 20182021 in order to keep offering generous dividends On the contrary HF Sinclair suspended its dividend for one year and issued some shares in order to fund two highly profitable acquisitionsIn late 2021 the company acquired the Puget Sound Refinery from Shell  for 350 million In addition in early 2022 the company acquired Sinclair Oil and thus it added two refineries a renewable diesel business and a branded marketing business to its business portfolio It is needless to say that the timing of these acquisitions was ideal as refining margins skyrocketed shortly after the deals and have remained above average since then Therefore these two deals have offered outsized returns on investment so farOn the other hand investors should not expect the exceptionally high refining margins to remain in place for years The refining industry is infamous for its dramatic cyclicality During periods of wide margins some refineries invest in the expansion of their capacity while some new refineries are built as well Consequently global refining capacity increases and thus it leads refining margins to lower levels especially if the global economy decelerates or falls into a recessionNotably the US refining margins  by approximately 30 during the last month from about 29 per barrel to 202 barrel This is their lowest level since January 2022 just before the onset of the war in Ukraine The current refining margins are somewhat higher than the average refining margins of about 18 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 but the tailwind from the Ukrainian crisis seems to have abated The steep correction is somewhat surprising given the heavy seasonal maintenance activity of refiners which normally provides support to refining margins Moreover as the sharp correction of refining margins is very recent it is hard to forecast at what level margins will stabilizeOverall the tailwind from the sanctions of western countries on Russia seems to be fading Indeed analysts expect the earnings per share of HF Sinclair to decrease by 31 next year and by another 15 in 2025 from 1006 this year to 591 in 2025HF Sinclair is offering a 33 dividend yield The stock has a payout ratio of only  and hence its dividend has a wide margin of safety despite the cycl,1,2023-10-04,2

212,Biofuel Demand Strengthens The Business Case For U.S. Agribusiness,Farmers are often both food producers and suppliers of a range of raw materials with the latter now becoming more important than everThere are a number of feedstocks that the US biofuels industry uses to produce biofuels Corn is by far the largest representing over 90 of the volume with most corn being processed into conventional ethanol The second largest feedstock for biofuels is soybean oil making up around 3 of the total feedstock used Animal fats used cooking oil UCO and vegetable oils like soybean oil are generally turned into biodiesel orUsing corn to produce ethanol initially took off following the Renewable Fuel Standards RFS in the mid2000s and Californias LowCarbon Fuel Standards LCFS Weve written about these policies in a bit more detail previously  The number of corn bushels used for ethanol has been relatively stable in the last decadeWere now seeing strong growth in the use of other feedstocks which is mainly the result of  The expansion in refining capacity has led to additional demand for animal fats and UCO but we also see more soybean and canola oil from oilseed crushers and corn oil from distillers being turned into renewable diesel Increased production of renewable diesel is mainly taking place at the expense of biodiesel and total renewable diesel production volume has overtaken biodiesel production for the first time in 2023Both animal fats and UCO are rapidly approaching their supply limits according to the International Energy Agency The US already has high UCO collection rates so its also looking abroad for additional supply  and this means that competition between the US and the EU for Asian UCO supply is heating up The future supply picture for animal fats is mixed US cattle inventory is following a downward trend limiting the growth potential for beef tallow the most important animal fat used in biofuels Larger supplies from the poultry industry can partly offset this due to the growth in the number of broilersThe biofuel market continues to evolve and we see varying demand outlooks for different feedstocks Since corn ethanol demand from the road transportation sector has likely peaked already overcoming hurdles to enter the market for sustainable aviation fuels remains a key concern Given the ongoing growth in renewable diesel capacity there is clearly more growth potential for fats and vegetable oils Ethanol producers and oilseed crushers are also busy with upgrading the protein content in their other products to tap into higher valueadded feed and food applicationsCorn is the most widely used feedstock when it comes to biofuel production in the US specifically for ethanol production The ethanol sector accounts for around 38 of total corn consumption which is up significantly from just 6 in the early 2000s Historically the view has been that there is a blending wall for the US ethanol industry with the widely accepted barrier being at 10 However its become more apparent in recent years that this blend wall does not appear to be as impenetrable as previously thought with the ethanol blending rate in the US exceeding 10 since 2016 The growing availability of E15 and the capacity for a larger share of the vehicle fleet running on it would have helped to break above 10 Any car with a model year 2001 or newer is approved to run on E15 which is basically almost 96 of the car fleetA further increase in blending rates will likely drive any growth in US ethanol demand from the road transportation sector However given efficiency gains in cars with combustion engines and the growing share of electric vehicle EV sales road fuel demand in the US is likely to decline in the coming years In turn this will reduce the amount of ethanol that will be neededIn the next decade we expect downward pressure to emerge on the demand for biofuels in road transportation  especially in the latter part of this decade Because current biofuel product,1,2023-10-23,1

217,Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),Over most of the past year I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads I  my longterm bullish take on MarathonHowever as discussed more recently  Ive downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash  in the crack spread As such it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon considering its stock remains generally high However its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopoliticalrelated production cuts Overall investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum depending on how we calculate its forward valuationFor the most part refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly My longterm view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today That said the shortterm outlook has changed as volatility mounts raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022 However oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around 87 per barrel today Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil  Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped Marathon has retained much of its value but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income The crack spread is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs crude oil has crashed particularly for the gasoline spread See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profitLuckily Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of 32barrel to 19barrel today That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above All else being equal this 12barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of 1296 annualized 324B quarterly  have only changed marginally over this period Natural gas has also hardly changed so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathons refining marginsThe company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023 However this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathons current EBITDA See belowHistorically Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around 15 depending on changes in other operating costs Today that spread is below its typical range before COVID19 indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around 15B per quarter from its Midstream segment In comparison its refining margins can vary from negative  seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage Its refining segment EBITDA was 316B in Q2 and may be as low as 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant Combined with an expected 15B from Midstream I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at 142B given limited changes in commodity prices and volumesMarathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the  I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the ,13,2023-10-09,5

223,Vertex Energy: Transition To Traditional Refiner Hasn't Been Smooth,With Vertex Energy  dealing with some hiccups with its renewable diesel project and crack spreads narrowing for its conventional refining business it might be best to wait on the sidelines with the stock for nowVTNRVTRNs Black Oil and Recovery segment meanwhile is involved in the recycling and rerefining of used motor oil and other petroleum byproducts The company buys used oil from places such as oil change stations and autoVTNR is going through the process of transforming itself from a rerefining company to a refinery company In May 2021 the company agreed to purchase the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell RDSA for 75 million At the time the company said upon the conversion of the refinerys hydrocracking unit to produce renewable diesel that the refinery could produce 3 billion in revenue and 400 million in gross profits in 2023This project was expected cost an additional 85 million to complete The project was neither on time nor on budget with renewable diesel production starting in Q2 of this year and the project costing over 110 millionShortly after the refinery acquisition in June of 2021 the company agreed to sell its 69 million gallon a year used oil refining Marrero facility in Louisiana and its 20 million gallon a year Heartland facility in Ohio to Clean Harbors  for 140 million The facilities were projected to generate more than 100 million in revenue and at least 15 million in EBITDA That valued the sale at just over 9x EBITDAHowever the deal was scrapped in January of 2022 following a review by the US Federal Trade Commission VTRN then turned around and sold its Heartland facility to GFL Environmental  for  in February of this year Given that his was the much smaller facility of the two that VTRN was originally selling for 140 million less than two years earlier this looks like a really good priceThe company continues to own the Marrero facility and some other legacy assets Well see if the company eventually looks to dispose of it or other assets I wouldnt necessarily extrapolate the value of Heartland into Marrero but there does appear to be some nice value there So there is an opportunity the company could lower debt with some additional asset salesAs of now though the companys big bet is on renewable diesel with its project now complete and starting to produce the renewable fuel However the company has backed off of earlier predictions and the economics are still up in the air at this point as the company ran into some economics on the initial feedstock it planned to use However the plant was built to support 8 different feedstocks so it is currently looking to shift feedstocksWhen asked if the company still planned to produce 8000 barrels of renewable diesel a day CCO Douglas Haugh answered the question on its  sayingAt this point there should be a lot of potential with renewable diesel especially with government credits The company also has a product supply agreement with a Californiabased subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan However given its commentary things are not going to be quite as smooth as it originally expectedOutside of renewable diesel crack spreads and dynamics for VGO will also play a big role in the companys results both on the potential upside and downside Traditional crack spreads were extremely wide last year and not surprisingly have come down this year They were still well above historical norms in the first half of the year but have come down significantly recentlyThis is a big risk for the business at this point as crack spreads are the biggest driver of a refining business In fact VTNR had to lower its guidance ahead of its Q2 report as a result of lower crack spreads and a weak capture rate as a result of volatile fuel pricesThe company also carries a fair amount of debt with net leverage of 36x at the end of Q2 For such a cyclical business coming off peak crack spreads last year this,9,2023-10-11,1

231,Why Petrobras Is A Great Alternative To Other Oil Majors,Petrobras officially known as    is a 90billion market cap Brazilian oil and gas company with operations both domestically and internationally Petrobras is involved in various aspects of the energy industry including exploration production refining transportation marketing andIt is one of the worlds  oil producers and one of the top 5 exporters of crude oil Petrobras plays a dominant role in the Brazilian energy market  of the countrys oil and gas production The firm is divided into  Exploration and Production Refining Transportation and Marketing and Gas and Power Corporate excluded Petrobras released its Q2 FY2023 financial results and theyIn addition Petrobras achieved a net profit of 58 billion and generated an FCF of 67 billion The companys distribution of dividends totaling 62 billion amid a comfortable OCF of 96 billion underscores PBRs financial strength in my viewOperationally Petrobras reported growth in production especially in the presalt region which now accounts for 78 of their overall production Key projects like the FPSO Almirante Barroso and the acquisition of new exploration blocks highlight their determination to expand production capacity In downstream activities Petrobras showcased its refinery modernization efforts including revamping projects carbon footprint reduction initiatives and technological innovationsOn October 2nd 2023 we found out that Petrobras  by Brazils top environmental agency Ibama to conduct research in the Potiguar basin part of the Equatorial Margin offshore region in Brazils Northeast This comes after months of negotiations and setbacks Petrobras now plans to begin drilling in the area next month to assess the economic viability and extent of oil discoveries made in 2013 at the Pitu well is a promising oil exploration opportunity in Brazil potentially holding reserves similar to those in Guyana where Exxon Mobil  is developing multibillionbarrel discoveries Ibama  Petrobras from drilling in the Foz do Amazonas basin due to environmental concerns leading to this alternative exploration planPetrobras now plans to drill 16 exploratory wells between 20232027 with an estimated investment of 15 billion reais 3 billion dollars in sedimentary basins such as Foz do Amazonas ParáMaranhão Barreirinhas and PotiguarIn addition PBR has other projects that will be put into operation very soonPerhaps the only thing that has kept PBR stock from impressive growth in recent months  besides the falling oil price  is geopolitics But in my opinion the fears surrounding Petrobras related to the election of Brazilian President Lula now appear to be exaggerated Petrobras  nationalized or forced to cut dividends entirely Since Lulas presidency began there has been less aggressive intervention in the companys affairs than many people thought The change in dividend policy reducing the distribution to 45 of FCF as we may see now does not significantly impact Petrobrass dividend attractiveness in my view especially when compared to other international oil and gas majorsIn late September Goldman Sachs analysts slightly improved Brazils real GDP growth expectations proprietary source for FY2023 due to a higherthanexpected Q2 2023 print with a projection of 292 Expectations for FY2024 GDP growth stand at 150 So in general the macro situation in Brazil looks good  it should create a favorable background for the future growth of the Brazilian stock market where PBR should be one of the market leadersOn the global macro front taking into account recent events in Israel another group of Goldman Sachs analysts sees two potential impacts that could affect global oil supplies over time proprietary source paraphrased by the authorThe issue of high oil prices in the world market is a major concern for inflation expectations but not for energy companies like PBR  recent events are clearly bullish for th,58,2023-10-10,1
232,Tesla Q3 Earnings Anticipation: Tracking Megapack's Progress And Pricing,  is set to report thirdquarter earnings  on October 18 2023 The companys recently disclosed Q3  figures disappointed some investors as units grew annually butDespite Tesla maintaining fullyear guidance markets seemed unimpressed as the stock barely moved on the delivery news With Teslas upcoming earnings on the horizon looking back at its historical stock performance can provide perspective on the current opportunity Though Q3 deliveries underwhelmed examining how the stock has previously reacted to results can reframe how investors evaluate Tesla heading into the printWith a market cap approaching 800 billion Teslas valuation has long sparked debate Prominent shortseller  whoLooking back reveals four key valuation leaps tied to Teslas strategic product launches 2030 billion market cap valued Tesla as a luxury automaker based on highpriced Models S and X targeting the upper market This positioned Tesla similarly to premium brands like BMW  and Mercedes  based on its focus on sleek highend electric sedans and SUVs during this period Launching the mass market Model 3 in July 2017 marked a pivotal moment fueling the first major jump in Teslas valuation By demonstrating its ability to produce an affordable midrange electric vehicle Tesla showed its potential to disrupt the broader auto market through electrification The Model 3 opened Tesla up to a much wider audience beyond just luxury buyers Introducing the midsize Model Y SUV in early 2020 expanded Teslas addressable market propelling a second steep valuation rise Adding a more affordable electric SUV enabled Tesla to compete in the hugely lucrative crossover segment the most popular vehicle type in the US market This moved Tesla beyond just cars into the leading product category The Model Y helped push Teslas valuation to around 400 billion surpassing the market cap of industry leader Toyota  which was around 200 billion The third major surge in Teslas valuation began in September 2020 as the company  its Full SelfDriving FSD beta test program and detailed plans for a robotaxi network Bullish analysts like Morgan Stanleys Adam Jonas propelled the stock higher by valuing Teslas software and services business including the potential for an autonomous ridesharing platform at nearly the same level as its automotive operations This pushed Teslas market cap from around 400 billion up to 800 billion by late 2020 The prospect of Tesla evolving into a leader in autonomous taxi services powered by AI and software led many investors to significantly expand the companys total addressable market and opportunity beyond just electric vehiclesOur analysis below revealed that despite the FSD efforts modest success they would not be able to maintain their 400 billion valuation boostTesla disclosed that  owners in the United States and Canada now have access to the FSD beta representing high penetration among existing owners given Tesla has sold over  vehicles globally With around 400000 customers in North America alone on the autonomous platform Tesla has reached material scale in its installed base of FSD users For context Uber  had a market cap of 60100 billion at the time based on its ridesharing network Teslas base of FSD beta users highlights the companys leadership in autonomous driving technology among consumer vehiclesHowever gaps remain in justifying Teslas valuation based on its total addressable markets Another surge occurred in August 2021 after the announcement of a 100000vehicle  from Hertz  But the global rental car market is only around  far below the over 1 trillion valuation Tesla reached Even combining rental cars and the  heavy truck market the combined total addressable market or TAM is dwarfed by Teslas peak 1 trillion valuationThis helps explain Teslas 50 pullback from over 1 trillion to around 400 billion as the upside from autonomous driving renta,132,2023-10-03,3
233,MAG Silver: Juanicipio Reaches Nameplate Capacity,Just over ten months ago I   noting that while it had an exciting year ahead the better course of action was waiting for a steep pullback vs chasing the rally above US1670 This isMAG Silver reported its production results from Juanicipio 44 ownership this week with Fresnillo  as the operator noting that nameplate capacity of 4000 tonnes per day was reached in Q3 a development that shareholders have been anxiously waiting for after the slower than planned tiein to the national power grid This is positive news as it has derisked operations given that MAG Silver no longer has to rely on excess capacity being available at Fresnillos Fresnillo and Saucito plants in the district However it did impact Q3 production with no material heading to these mills in August and September resulting in tonnes processed declining by over 14 to 322200 tonnes So while grades were higher sequentially at 523 grams per tonne of silver Q2 2023 498 grams per tonne of silver production slid to 478 million ounces of silver and 9400 ounces of gold translating to a 2 decline in silver and gold productionLooking at the production on an attributable basis above MAGs share of production 44 came in at 21 million ounces of silver and 4100 ounces of gold before adjustments translating to over 50 million in attributable revenue despite the lower metals prices in the period However we should see an even better year in 2024 with the benefit of lower transportation costs at Juanicipio no need to tollmill material and annual attributable production to MAG Silver of 85 million ounces of silver translating to equity income of at least 75 million in 2024 FY2022 408 million These proceeds will top up MAG Silvers already strong cash position 54 million with no debt which can be directed towards drilling at Juanicipio Deer Trail and Larder LakeSpeaking of exploration investors continue to await results from its new Larder Lake Project and Deer Trail has continued to see exploration success which I detailed briefly in my  However the most significant opportunity is in the Fresnillo District at Juanicipio even if things have been quiet with the last major updated being in Q2 2022 This is because just 5 of the entire property has been explored to date and directly beneath the Bonanza Zone thats currently being mined 102 million tonnes of resources at 550 grams per tonne of silver are multiple additional zones with the Deep Zone having significantly more tonnes and higher base metal and gold grades offset by lower silver grades as well as highgrade veins like Venadas discovered in 2019 that run opposite to the typical northwest orientations with highlight intercepts of 21 meters true width at 489 grams per tonne of silver and 094 grams per tonne of gold 14 meters at 491 grams per tonne of silver and 269 grams per tonne of gold and 25 meters at 918 grams per tonne of silver and 18 grams per tonne of goldSince the 2019 drill program that uncovered Venadas I and II and the PreAnticipada Vein MAG Silver has continued to complete infill drilling at the much larger Deep Zone with highlight intercepts in 2020 including several thick intercepts that includedAnd as of the 2022 update MAG noted that most of its intercepts are comparable to neighboring holes which confirm its expectations of grade and thickness and is now confident that Valdecanas sits on top of an upwelling zone that is contributing to this considerable mineral endowment In addition the company believes that it may have multiple upwelling zones on its property and the previous discovery of dilatant zones is certainly an exciting development This is significant because the market may be underestimating the economic potential of Juanicipio which is an asset that could ultimately remain in production past 2050 if we can continue to see exploration success Plus with MAG Silver being the minority partner of t,3,2023-10-26,5
234,Comstock Has A Strategic Advantage For Filling LNG Export Capacity,Comstock  like all natural gas EPs is facing tough comps going through 2023 I firmly expect this to be a shortterm challenge as new LNG export capacity will be coming online through the QatarEnergyExxon JV for theOne of the strongest values Comstock brings to the table is their low cost of production Their cost to operate a well sits at 114Mcfe 29 lower than their peer average This low cost of production provides Comstock with a tremendous amount of safety when compared to their competitors especially in times of low gasDespite the challenging gas market Comstock is proactive and hedges roughly 40 of their book with an average floor of 299 This provided Comstock tremendous breathing room as gas prices dipped down to 206mcf in April 2023 its lowest price since August 2020As far as operations and capital investment Comstock has been investing significantly into exploratory drilling and completion As theyre enhancing their properties in the HaynesvilleBossier region theyve invested 104mm into exploratory DC for the first 6 months of 2023 nearly 25x the investment from 2022 Unproved property acquisition more than doubled for the same time frame suggesting further development is on the horizon in the coming years This absolutely coincides with the expansion of LNG terminals in the Gulf Coast from 12MTPA to the additional 9Bcfeday of LNG export capacity to get to the 21Bcfday capacity by 2027Until new capacity comes online Im expecting Comstocks production volumes to remain relatively flat as natural gas  I think this is a strong strategy to build up their lease book now as prices are relatively low and complete new higher tier gas wells as new export capacity comes online This will allow Comstock to fully capitalize on their property development as opposed to producing just to produceOf course the one aspect Comstock will need to keep in consideration is lease expiration which could hinder their plan if pricing doesnt gravitate higherNearterm the next LNG terminal to come online is the QatarEnergyExxon   which should be coming online in late 2024 According to  Exxon will have rights to 30 of the export capacity once online This project will add an additional 32mtpa in which Exxon will have rights to 8mtpa Free capacity should come out to something like 320bcfdayComstock is navigating through 2023 with challenging comps as their realized price for natural gas dropped 74 YY for Q223 Though natural gas has the tendency to have highly volatile prices I believe Comstocks hedge book through 2024 should keep them relatively protected in the instance of a continued challenging market Revenue for natural gas sales declined by 21 on a yeartoyear basis using TTM figures One asset that should bring more stability to Comstocks operations is their 145mile pipeline service that they acquired FY22 Though this pipeline was acquired to transport their own natural gas out of the HaynesvilleBossier basin this pipeline gave Comstock the flexibility to market and transport other EPs natural gas Overall this feature accounts for 20 of the firms revenue generation EBITDA generated from gas service came out to be 44mm for Q223 on a TTM basis with an 8 marginEBITDAX margin compressed a few points to 68 for Q223 on a TTM basis down from 77 two quarters ago Given the direction of natural gas from the start of q323 to where it presently sits comps will remain challenging but look better on a sequential basis Im not expecting much excitement in the natural gas EP space until the Golden Pass export terminal comes online in 2H24 or if a severe winter were to occur this year Otherwise it will be a waiting gameOne of the values management brought to the table was the initiation of a quarterly dividend at the end of FY22 At this present price the dividend pays an annual rate of 050share for a yield of 475 Though we cannot presume an increase to the divide,5,2023-10-05,5
235,First Solar: Growing Capacity And A Growing Backlog Equals Growth,First solar  was founded in 1990 and was incorporated in 1999 In 2002 they finished their first commercial production facility in Perrysburg Ohio with the capacity to create 15 megawatts per year Today First Solar is the largest producer of solar panels inFirst Solar will be building their  for a cost of 11 billion located in Louisiana Funding for this new facility is partly due to the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in August 2022 It is expected to come online in 2026 bringing 35 more gigawatts of manufacturing capacity per year adding to its existing 115 GW Just this year alone the company has made plans to spend an additional 17 billion at a new site in Alabama and by expanding a facility in OhioAt current production levels and with no new orders the company has a backlog that will last until at least 2030 The slide below shows their backlog at different dates in the blue bars And the green demonstrates how their backlog is growing throughout 2023 In other words their order backlog is outpacing their ability to produce solar panels This is an encouraging sign for investorsThe following slide demonstrates the total opportunities that are available in the solar industry for First Solar to go out and get This demonstrates that even though they have a backlog that will last until 2030 the potential to extend that backlog is also thereCurrently the subsidies that individuals can receive for installing  are up to 30 of the cost of the panels according to some sources This is set to continue from 2023 all the way until 2032 This provides some strong visibility into the future demand for solar panelsIn addition First Solar was able to begin building a fifth plant using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act And so we can see that the solar industry is subsidized on the capital funding side as well as on the demand sideI am not going to evaluate what percentage of First Solars profit is dependent on subsidies in this article but it is important to know that a certain percentage of both First Solars demand and their capital investments are subsidizedI rarely like to invest in a business that requires subsidies from the US government or any government however many people have become fabulously wealthy by investing into government tax breaks whether that be local or federal tax breaks And so while I might shy away from companies like this others might see this as an opportunityGoing forward the question I will be interested in is what will the economics of solar panels be when the subsidies run out in 2032 Will they be able to produce panels economically enough for subsidies to not be necessary I dont know the answer but I think that based on First Solars backlog they will have plenty of opportunities to find ways to make the panels more economical and with the full force of the climatechange narrative and the government funding backing the industry I wouldnt expect First Solars backlog to experience any kind of decline So I would love nothing more than for the solar industry to be able to create energy that no longer requires subsidies Time will tellAs of this writing First Solar has a 20 billion market capitalization So is this cheap or is this expensive relative to the performance of their current business Lets measure this relative to operating cash flowHere are the cash flows from operations for the past four years With a 20 billion market cap I believe First Solar is a little overvalued relative to these cash flows I wont discuss their balance sheet in this article but First Solar also has a strong balance sheet The question is will First Solars cash flows grow dramatically over the coming years They certainly have potential growth catalysts in that they are expanding their manufacturing facilities For arguments sake lets extrapolate that in 2024 First Solar will have Cash Flows From Operations of 1 Billion Even then at todays prices,44,2023-09-01,6
236,Should You Be Worried About Medical Properties Trust's Liquidity Profile?,  is expected to have a tough liquidity position in the coming quarters plus its refinancing needs in the next three years are quite worrisomeAs Ive  I have been bearish on MPW overWhile MPW has recently cut in half its dividend I still see its dividend as unsustainable and expect a liquidity crunch in the near future if management dont take actions to improve its cash position Regarding this last issue Ive received some pushback thus in this article I analyze in moreAs Ive  I see MPWs investment case highly geared to its highdividend yield but this represents a cash burn that the company does not have capacity to sustain over the long term  its cash outflow related to dividend payments amounted to nearly 700 million and after its dividend cut its annual outflow is around 360 millionWhile this represents a lower cash burn for MPW its organic cash flow over the past six months was rather weak given that its cash flow from operations was only 212 million and capital expenditures amounted to some 180 million Therefore free cash flow was only 32 million in the first half of 2023 clearly not enough to cover its historical dividend payments 350 million in H1 2023 and outflows expected in the coming quarters some 75 million per quarterLooking at the companys cash flow statement MPW has financed its dividend in the past few quarters through asset sales and borrowings an unsustainable situation over the long term While its cash position at the end of last June enables it to pay the reduced quarterly dividend from cash on hand this situation will change dramatically next DecemberIndeed MPWs cash balance was 329 million  while its quarterly dividend payment amount to some 75 million Therefore its next quarterly dividend expected to be paid next October is not an issue but MPW has a significant cash outflow next December related to a sterling bondIts 400 million bond matures on December 5 2023 which at current exchange rate leads to an outflow of nearly 500 million While MPW does not have enough cash to pay this debt this doesnt mean it will go bankrupt next December given that it can continue to borrow from its revolving credit facility with  According to Bloomberg data this revolving credit facility has a total approved amount of 18 billion of which MPW already has used more than 12 billion Therefore MPW will need to borrow an additional amount during Q4 to pay down its sterling bond and maintain some cash on hand more likely will borrow the remaining amount of 589 million availableI think this is the most likely outcome to refinance this bond because MPWs current bonds are trading with very high credit spreads leading to current yields between 1214 depending on the maturity date Even for more shortdated bonds with maturities in 2026 and 2027 current yields are around these levels which make it practically impossible to refinance in the capital markets due to prohibitive costs and likely low appetite of credit investors for new bondsTaking into account that MPWs organic cash flow generation after dividend payments has been negative in recent quarters I expect MPWs cash position at the end of the year to be around 300 million assuming that it will use its revolving credit facility in full to refinance the upcoming bond maturityIn 2024 MPW had a significant loan reaching maturity in Australian dollars but it has reached a few months ago a deal to sell some assets enabling it to repay in full the related AUD loans Therefore during 2024 the company now only has a sterling term loan to pay amounting to some 130 millionAssuming a cash position of 300 million by end2023 this means MPW will run out of cash during 2024 if management does not take action to improve its liquidity profile Moreover while during 2024 debt maturities are not really concerning during 2025 it has more than 14 billion in loan and bond maturities being a big issue,254,2023-09-21,3

240,Kinder Morgan: A Premium Worth Paying,If you are looking for an incredibly diverse energy play with a solid dividend that is also increasing each year the KMI looks very good right now The share price has had a couple of bumpy lastThe longterm looks bullish for commodities like both oil and natural gas as the percentage of energy generated from them is still very large Even if investments increase each year into renewables I think KMI can deliver a significant ROI for investors still Despite trading at a premium to the sector based on earnings I find the premium worthwhile to pay given the quality of the dividend and the asset base KMI has This of course results in me rating KMI a buy currentlyKinder Morgan  stands as a prominent energy infrastructure giant within North America holding the distinction of being the largest energy infrastructure company in the SP 500 index The company operates within the midstream energy sector boasting a substantial network of approximately 82000 miles of pipelines 140 terminals and a significant storage capacity of 700 billion cubic feet for working natural gas This extensive infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the energy supply chain facilitating the efficient transport and storage of crucial resourcesThe company has managed to gather a massive amount of which has made them a leader and almost market mover in the natural gas space KMIs vast pipeline network transports a diverse range of essential products including natural gas refined petroleum products renewable fuels crude oil condensate CO2 and various other valuable commodities Furthermore the companys versatile terminals play a crucial role in storing and managing a wide spectrum of goods encompassing gasoline diesel fuel renewable fuel feedstocks chemicals ethanol metals and petroleum cokeThis diverse set of exposure is perhaps where some investors are discouraged but some are also encouraged What I mean by this is that KMI may not see the same immediate and rapid impact of rising commodity prices as a more pureplay natural gas company may On the other hand though KMI is more protected against downside risk in my opinion as the diversified nature of the business lends itself to some price hedgingOne of the key features of KMI is its setup with cash flows The company has an FCF margin of 887 right now which is right around where the 5year average has been as well As seen in the picture above KMI has managed to establish a predictable set of cash flows as 61 of it is made of takeorpayThe for KMI continues to be a highlight in my opinion The company has an FWD yield of 662 and that is sufficient to yield a strong ROI for investors especially when combined with general share appreciation from growing the EPS of the business The natural gas prices have come down quite a lot as we know but I think the trend forward is upwards The of Mexicos imports of natural gas is adding momentum to the price I think Even though KMI has a very high payout ratio the company still managed to improve its financial position Back in 2016 the company had a net debt position of 38 billion but this has since decreased to 31 billion insteadThe world population is continuously increasing and this is putting pressure on the energy outputs as well Natural gas and oil remain to be very viable sources of it In the coming couple of decades I think that they will remain in a dominant position in energy generation The capital necessary to switch them out to renewables is incredibly high and the material costs and amount of work are too high to make possible in a short period This means the market is still appealing to invest in as demand will be persistentLooking at hydrocarbons in applications like cement steel and fertilizer they are irreplaceable Seeing as these are materials and commodities widely used in our societies they will likely remain in high demand A rising population is also bringing a higher need for housing That s,30,2023-10-27,6
241,Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nationThis has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently however As regular readers may recall we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices although that is almost certainly a factor As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience Investors are no longer willing to wait years or decades to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios In todays highrate environment their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now Energy Transfer currently boasts an 884 yield so it certainly meets this requirement In fact this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the SP 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves however Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense todayAs stated in the introduction Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines storage facilities natural gas liquids fractionators natural gas processing plants and terminals The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant Overall its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific CoastThis is not especially surprising as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state As a result there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a resultAs mentioned earlier it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfers units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfers unit price since August 3 2023We can obviously see a correlation here as the two charts move almost in lockstep However Energy Transfers cash flows have very little to do with oil prices As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90 of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA a proxy for pretax cash flow will come from these volumebased contractsThus the companys financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers not their value As such its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the companys adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years In particular the average price of West Texas Intermediate was 3968 per barrel in 2020 6817 per barrel in 2021 and 9453 per barrel in 2022 The yeartodate average for 2023 is 7790 per barrel and Energy Transfers annualized adjusted EBITDA is 13110 billion Thus we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the companys adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believeWith that said there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do After all there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices However as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Prof,27,2023-10-20,1
242,Exxon Mobil: Artificially Inflated,As   takes on the alltime highs from earlier this year investors need to remember that oil is at far lower prices now and the world has plenty of supply The energy giant just printed aWTI crude CL1COM spent most of Q2 trading in the mid70 range When looking at the 5year chart oil is trading far above the levels prior to the Russian invasion in early 2022The Saudis have led an OPEC charge this year to raise prices by cutting oil production The country just announced plans to keep the  of 1 million barrels per dayThis cut was on top of additional cuts of 166 million barrels per day by OPEC members According to  from Platts and JP Morgan the current spare oil capacity from OPEC countries tops 4 million barrels per day and nearly matches the highest levels since at least 2000 outside of the initial Covid demand dip in 2020With Brent back to 94 our view is that oil prices have an upside to possibly 100 At a tripledigit price the Saudis are likely pressured back onto the market after publicly stating a need for only 85b in order to fund the governmentAs the above chart highlighted the world doesnt lack spare capacity Oil prices are only surging due to OPEC keeping supply artificially lowExxon Mobil reported  just over a month ago providing investors key insights to what normalized earnings look like now after the Russian invasion of Ukraine no longer impacts prices In addition the energy giant has cost cuts amounting to an estimated 9 billion since 2019The company only earned 194 per share during the June quarter The EPS missed analyst estimates by 008 and was nearly 1 per share below the prior quarters level of 283 and far below the peak profitsExxon Mobil provides this handy chart highlighting how Q2 margins were more within the norm of the 10year average margins especially for crucial crude and natural gas prices and refining margins The only segment with below historically normal margins is the Chemical segmentThe key dilemma is how to value the stock going forward Exxon Mobil has an annualized EPS below 8 per share making a 120 stock price very expensive at over 15x earnings run rateAnalysts have a 2024 EPS target at nearly 9 for a forward PE multiple of 13x This EPS target appears more in line with current market prices for oil and natural gasThe real risk to investors is that oil prices have been elevated for 18 months now The risk is for a cycle of lower oil prices similar to natural gas nowConsidering the spare capacity oil prices could fall below 70b and into at least the low 60b similar to back in 2019 Exxon Mobil would start reporting even lower earnings knowing the 2019 EPS was only 2 per shareThe company has 4 billion shares outstanding suggesting the 9 billion in cost savings would in theory add another 2 to EPS potential from the 2019 EPS level Exxon Mobil would have a 4 earning potential based on 2019 energy prices assuming all of the cost cuts werent replaced by additional spending in other categoriesThe key investor takeaway is that 120 appears the peak price for Exxon Mobil Corporation The stock is fully valued for elevated oil prices and the risk is now to the downside knowing that oil ultimately ends up at much lower prices over the next cycleInvestors should cash out at current levels and look for a better entry level when OPEC no longer has the ability to freely cut output to push oil prices higherStone Fox Capital aka Mark Holder is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance He is also Series 65 licensed and has 30 years of investing experience including 10 years as a portfolio manager  The information contained herein is for informational purposes only Nothing in this article should be taken as a solicitation to purchase or sell securities Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion or consult a financial advisor Investing includes risks including loss of,175,2023-09-15,1

244,The Costs And Investment Implications Of Reshoring,For the past three decades and in some ways stretching back up to five decades the US has been in a relative industrial declineMore specifically the share of the US economy that has been involved with manufacturingWe can see this manifested in our structural trade deficitAnd we can see it in our industrial production per capitaTo some extent this is to be expected as a country grows in wealth it tends to shift a bit more towards services and begins to rely on developing countries to supply it with physical goods However a number of countries like Switzerland Singapore Japan South Korea Taiwan and at least until their recent energy problems Germany have been successful at maintaining largeThe challenge with deindustrialization is that an economy can become hollowedout andor it can face national security issues during a cold war type of environment or during various logistical emergencies In other words its just not just about access to plastic trinkets its about access to critical things we dont think about like medical dyes military components or even just basic tools that we use for everything elseSo the themes of onshoring or reshoring or nearshoring have become a hot topic lately to some extent on the corporate level but especially on the federal level It refers to the idea of moving manufacturing facilities back to the US or to nearby countries so that supply chains in general are shorter less complex and more resilient And along these lines various stimulus efforts have gone into encouraging a boom in domestic manufacturingAnd it  showing up in the data This chart shows annualized spending on the construction of manufacturing facilitiesThe US used to run sub100 billion per year in manufacturing construction expenditure and now it has more than doubled Thats tangible even after adjusting for inflationHowever to provide context to the situation the US is currently heavily reliant on Chinas industrial base that is worth many trillions of dollars So this extra 100 billion just puts us in the first inning here if this is indeed to be the start of a reversalFor decades the United States was a larger trading partner than China for most countries However by the late 2010s China had flipped the US in this regard and it has only tilted further in Chinas favor since thenThe ability to be the worlds largest trading partner requires both making stuff and having the logistics to organize and ship that stuff Along those lines among the  seven are in China one is in Korea one is in Singapore and one is in the Netherlands To find the US on the list we have to dig down into the top 20 and top 30 container portsChina now produces more steel than the rest of the world combined and more than 12x as much as the USChina is by far the world leader in solar panels In terms of market share they are more important for the global solar market than Saudi Arabia is for the global oil marketFor rare earth elements broadly which are widely used throughout the electronics industry including the alternative energy industry China produces more than the rest of the world combined In recent years the rest of the world exUS has been regaining a minority share Rare earth elements are not particularly rare but they are found in low concentrations and thus tend to be environmentally destructive to extract and refine Most wealthy regions dont want to deal with thatJust within the past three years Chinas auto exports have hockeysticked in terms of growth Last year China surpassed Germany and this year they are  as the worlds largest auto exporter We dont see them in the United States but if you travel around the world youll see a lot more Chinese cars on the road than just a few years agoHere in 2023 China also officially put their first commercial airplane  into service The world now has the ABCs of commercial aviation Airbus  of E,161,2023-08-12,0
245,Lumen Technologies Q2 Earnings: Don't Panic,Last week Lumen Technologies   The telecommunications company is pursuing a transition away from legacy telecom assets into more modern hardware and services While the market reacted with heavy selling of the company shares aThe first look at Lumen Technologies income statement can put a good shock into investors The company recorded an operating loss of 84 billion in the second quarter on nearly 1 billion less revenue than the same quarter a year ago The entire operating loss was due to a goodwill impairment charge of 88 billion Without the impairment charge the operating loss would have been a gain of 370 million which is still 500 million lower than the same quarter a year agoPrior to panicking investors need to look at how the company is treating revenue through its transformation process Earlier this year Lumen divided its revenue into four product and service categories grow nurture harvest and other The company is committed to focusing on the growth segment of the business and despite declining 5 year over year all of the decline was due to the sale of the ILEC business segment In fact 72 of the revenue decline and 77 of the EBITDA decline was due directly to the divestiture of assetsThe companys balance sheet saw the most adverse change during the second quarter Lumens decision to write off nearly 88 billion in goodwill impairment led to a massive drop in assets and equity Despite the huge drop in shareholder equity of 82 billion year to date equity has increased by nearly 650 million this year if excluding the goodwill impairment Its important for debt investors to note that the value of the physical assets is drawing closer to the value of longterm debt in the event of a recovery situationLumens cash flow statement also showed a stark change compared to last year After posting free cash flow of 14 billion in the first six months of 2022 free cash flow was negative 940 million for the first half of this year The main driver behind the cash flow burn was the 938 million income tax payment made for divestitures last year If excluding special tax payments free cash flow is 0 year to date which is on the bottom end of the companys guidanceLumen is planning another divestiture that it hopes to close this year Late last year the company announced the sale of its EMEA business for approximately 18 billion in cash The proceeds of the EMEA deal should be enough to cover debt maturities through 2025 although the EMEA transactions tax estimates are currently unknown Its important to note that a majority of Lumens 2025 maturing debt is senior to publicly traded unsecured debt Should Lumen be forced to pay these loans off due to an inability to refinance or by choice it will actually enhance the value of the companys unsecured debtDespite big drops in revenue and EBITDA management remains steadfast in its turnaround plan For the full year 2023 Lumen management reaffirmed its guidance only dropping the expenses related to stock based compensation This makes sense when comparing the year to date financial results with the  in June during the companys Investor Day While current revenue trends are slightly below guidance EBITDA is currently projected to drop 10 this year outperforming a 13 drop from management guidanceIn addition to generating the cash needed to fund debt maturities through 2025 with the sale of the EMEA business Lumen has an additional 24 billion in liquidity that is composed of 400 million in cash and 2 billion revolver capacity that it can tap into While the company does not need to tap into the revolver at this time it could become useful if the mitigation of lead based copper becomes a real issue which Lumen acknowledged in its 10Q but stated the financial impacts if any remain largely unknownFrom an investment standpoint I think investors should look at either the 2025 bonds or the 20392042 bonds The 202,453,2023-08-07,0

247,Casey's General Stores Stock: Boring Is Beautiful,Quick name a company that rallied 14 in 2022 and is up 21 YTD 2023 Is it Apple Inc  Is it Microsoft Corp  No its actually the convenience store operator This little known convenience store operator has been able to beat market darlings like Apple and Microsoft since the end of 2021 and it shows no signs of slowing down recently soaring 11 on the release of its Q1F24  How good were these results and whats in store for Caseys in the futureFirst for those not familiar with Caseys the company is the 3rd largest operator of convenience stores in the US with more than 2500 stores in the US MidWesternA key differentiating factor in the Caseys story is that more than 50 of the companys stores are located in rural towns with 5000 people or less so in addition to selling fuel Caseys also plays the role of grocery and general merchandise stores as well as fast food restaurants This leads to Caseys having a higher share of gross profit dollars from inside sales and better gross margins than competitors For Caseys approximately 23 of gross profit dollars are generated from inside sales Figure 3Caseys also owns its own distribution centers 3 DCs provide most of Caseys inside store goods allowing the company to have better control over its valuechain and squeeze out additional operational efficiencies Figure 4This has resulted in peerleading financial performance with Caseys delivering consistent doubledigit growth in EBITDA and earnings in the past decade Figure 5I initiated on Caseys last year and readers may want to refer to that  for additional information on CaseysRecently Caseys reported its first quarter  for fiscal 2024 with revenues of 387 billion 130 YoY and dil EPS of 452 105 YoY Figure 6 Revenues for Caseys are dependent on fuel prices and can be volatile but earnings were notably strong beating consensus estimates by 119  shareOperationally Caseys earnings beat was driven by a number of factors First fuel margins were strong at 416 cents  gallon compared to managements guidance of mid30s despite a steep decline in fuel prices from 449 in the yearago period to 340 per gallon in Q1F24 Figure 7 Caseys also sold 36 YoY more fuel this quarterInside sales were also strong with a 54 YoY increase and a 121 2yr stacked growth rate with a 406 gross margins Figure 8 The introduction of new prepared food items was called out by management for contributing to inside sales growthFurthermore Caseys gross margins benefited from private label goods which offer customers a good value proposition while being margin accretive for the company Figure 9In my initiation article I noted that tight supplydemand dynamics have been the main driver for higher fuel margins as refining capacity had been taken offline in the US due to environmental concerns in the last few years This has helped push fuel margins up from the 20 cent  gallon level to mid 30 cents range since 2020 and recently to the 40 cent range Figure 10Furthermore the decline of tobacco sales and limited inside sale categories have pressured the profitability of mom and pop convenience stores forcing them to raise fuel prices to compensate Figure 11 This has indirectly benefited large chains like Caseys that have large format stores with attractive inside sales marginsFor fiscal 2024 Casey is guiding to fuel margins in the mid30 cents but recent results suggest they may stay elevated above that level In fact fuel margins have stayed above 346 cents for a record 9 straight quarters for Caseys significantly contributing to the companys strong profitability Figure 12While management has been coy about the sustainability of 40 cents fuel margins there does not appear to be any nearterm impetus for margins to return to historical sub35 cent levelsAnother reason Caseys jumped following the quarter was because Caseys updated m,2,2023-09-13,0
248,Refined Products: Middle Distillate Tightness To Persist, Refined product markets witnessed significant strength over the Northern Hemisphere summer which helped to drive refinery margins to their highest levels since last year StrengthMore recently however margins have started to give back a lot of these gains Weakness has been largely driven by gasoline as we come to the end of the summer driving season Middle distillates have also come under some renewed pressure more recently The latest release of Chinese export quotas would likely have put some pressure on cracksLonger term refined product markets remain vulnerable Inventories are mostly tight and global refining capacity has remained largely unchanged since 2019 with new capacity offset byA delay in the release of the third batch of refined product export quota from the Chinese government initially provided some support to refined product markets Uncertainty over when we would finally see this released and the volume of the third tranche were supportive Recently the government finally issued the third batch which amounted to 12 million tonnes more than the 10 million tonnes the market was expecting This also means that export quotas released to date total 3999 million tonnes above the 3725 million issued over the whole of 2022 The increase in refinery run rates this year has allowed for a higher quota allocationHowever what is not clear is whether the government will release a fourth batch of export quotas Much will likely depend on how domestic demand evolves over the remainder of the year Even if we see further releases it does not guarantee that further quotas will have to be used before the end of the year As we saw last year the government may allow some of these to be rolled over into early next yearHigher export quotas have obviously translated into higher export volumes of refined products Over the first seven months of the year refined product exports totalled 3662 million tonnes up 46 yearonyear Diesel exports have seen the largest increase with 84 million tonnes exported compared to just 24 million over the same period last yearLike last year the middle distillate market has led the strength amongst refined products The ICE gasoil crack has traded as high as 45bbl recently with the NYMEX heating oil crack hitting highs of more than 50bbl while Singapore gasoil cracks briefly traded a little over 35bbl in AugustDeclining middle distillate inventories have helped to push the market higher with stocks well below the fiveyear average in most regions including the US ARA in Europe and Singapore The concern is that inventories have been falling and are already low as we head into the Northern Hemisphere winter a period where you would expect to see stronger demand This suggests that middle distillate cracks are likely to be fairly wellsupportedIn Europe a key issue has been the ability of buyers to replace Russian products Prior to the EU ban on Russian refined products Russian gasoil flows to the EU were about 450Mbblsd In the leadup to the ban there was some frontloading evident in the buildup of inventory over the latter part of 2022 and into early 2023 Since the ban the EU has turned to other origins however it would appear that this is not enough to fully make up for the loss of Russian supply As a result we have seen ARA gasoil inventories steadily declining since late FebruaryRecovering air travel has also played an important role in the renewed strength seen in middle distillates This is evident in the widening of jet fuels premium to gasoil in Northwest Europe whilst the Asian regrade discount continues to narrow This shouldnt be too surprising given that air traffic continues to move towards more normal levels The latest data from the International Air Transport Association show that air passenger traffic revenue passenger kilometres in July was 44 below the same period in 2019 In fact in North America and Latin America pass,1,2023-09-07,0

251,Lockheed Martin Q3 Earnings Preview: A Tricky Situation,  stock has drawn increasing attention from investors recently for two reasons  first the fairly rapid selloff from over 450 to under 400 in a little over a month and more recently the Hamas attackI first covered the company in a detailed report in So lets dive right inFigure 1 shows the volatility of LMT stock since the beginning of 2022  Russias invasion of Ukraine and peak pessimism during the 2022 bear market are clearly visible The recent spike on October 9 due to the Hamas attack on Israel is also clear but also look at the increase since early September There are several reasons for the recent rise in volatilityAs I explained in my first article on the company I own this defense pure play as a noncyclical or even countercyclical investment that gives me exposure to the industrial sector However it should be kept in mind that the performance of defense contractors correlates with current government defense spending and its expected growth With a national debt well over  austerity measures should not be ruled out in theory but of course with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine recent events in Israel and political tensions between China and Taiwan it is unrealistic to expect defense spending to remain flat or even decline in the future The fiscal 2024 budget request of 842 billion for the Department of Defense is  than the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 requests respectively However I do not expect defense spending to grow in the high single digits or even low double digits in the future Instead given the  in defense spending between 2017 and 2021 55 average annual growth rate I believe continued moderate growth is the most likely outcome in this environmentIn addition to the in my view unfounded fears of a cap on defense spending amid alltime high national debt it was the news of a possible  that made investors nervous After all payments to defense contractors could be delayed and new contracts could be postponed or not awarded at all While this is a risk to consider before investing in the defense sector I maintain that a government shutdown will eventually resolve itself Therefore I consider these occasional events to be more or less irrelevant to defense stock valuations but of course such news does lead to increased stock volatilityGiven the war in Ukraine and the recent attacks on Israel it seems only logical that Lockheed would be one of the immediate beneficiaries  so its understandable that LMT stock jumped in response to the headlines at least in theoryGranted Lockheed is very well positioned with its F35 fighter jet franchise reliable cash flows for decades and the close combat precision fires and strike systems it offers through its Missiles and Fire Control segment However given the companys significant reliance on longterm procured projects an immediate jump in sales and profits is an unrealistic expectation In this context the positive reaction to RTX stock is much more understandable given the  installed in IsraelThat said I believe LMT will benefit in the long run The 2022 invasion of Ukraine exposed the inadequate defense capabilities of several European countries and the company subsequently saw significant orders for F35s eg   In my view the reality revealed once again of how quickly hot wars can emerge is a stark reminder to governments around the world to maintain an adequate defense infrastructure  despite the need for austerity measures in the face of record levels of national debtHowever I think there is more to consider than government debt and a possible shutdown In my view it was the flattening of the yield curve that contributed to the selloff Longterm government bond yields have been gradually rising rather quickly since early September and the 20Year Treasury for example even exceeded a yield of 51 in early October With  similarly high the market is finally pricing in a higher for longer int,25,2023-10-11,0
252,"MPLX LP: A Worthy Prospect, But Not The Best Out There",In my opinion some of the best prospects in this market today are those companies that operate midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets Examples of these assets include pipelines storage facilities terminals for handling commodities and finished products created from commodities and more EvenEven though I am active in analyzing companies in the midstream space I have not dug in too much into MPLX LP since  back in May of 2019 At that time the company had agreed to acquire Andeavor Logistics at an equity value of 867 billion Since those days management has succeeded in further growing the company But before we get into the fundamental data it might be helpful to discuss some of its assetsThe best way to do this I believe is to break the firm up into its  The first of these is known as the LS or Logistics and Storage segment Through this unit the company focuses on gathering transporting storing and distributing crude oil refined products renewable energy sources and more The segment also is involved in refining logistics the operation of terminals the oversight of rail facilities the operation of storage caverns and other similar activities As of the end of the firms 2022 fiscal year this segment included 15105 miles of holy and jointly owned pipelines and associated storage assets It also controlled refining logistics assets for 13 refineries 89 terminals and a variety of other propertiesNext in line we have the GP segment also known as the Gathering and Processing segment This unit unsurprisingly is involved in activities such as the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas However it also provides similar activities including also fractionation and storage for NGLs These assets at the end of the 2022 fiscal year boasted 104 Bcf per day of gathering capacity as well as 12 Bcf per day of natural gas processing capacity On top of this the company also had fractionation and deethanization capacity that totaled 829 thousand barrels per dayOne of the things that makes MPLX LP most interesting and unique is its ownership structure Approximately 65 of the companys outstanding shares are owned by   That company also has a noneconomic ownership over the general partner of MPLX LP The remaining 35 of outstanding stock as well as all of the 295 million preferred units of the company are owned by the public In addition to having control over MPLX LP Marathon also is responsible for about 47 of the companys revenue making it by far its largest customerIn terms of overall financial performance MPLX LP has been a really great enterprise In the chart above you can see that all of the companys most important financial metrics have improved over the three years ending in 2022 Revenue jumped from 757 billion to 1161 billion But even more important than that would be the earnings and cash flow results of the company The firm went from a net loss of 842 million in 2020 to a net profit of 382 billion last year Operating cash flow grew from 452 billion to 502 billion If we adjust for changes in working capital we get an increase from 472 billion to 514 billion DCF also known as distributable cash flow grew from 420 billion to 485 billion while EBITDA increased from 521 billion to 578 billion Another metric I like to look at in this space is what I refer to as true free cash flow This is derived from taking adjusted operating cash flow and only stripping out maintenance capital expenditures from it This prevents the company in question from being punished for its growthoriented capital expenditures Over the past three years this metric expanded from 458 billion to 498 billionAs you can see in the chart above financial performance for the  is also looking up compared to the same time one year earlier Yes revenue is lower year over year However profits and cash flows continue to grow This ,97,2023-09-04,0

261,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time,1306,2023-08-14,0

263,Phillips 66 Benefiting From Historically High Distillate Yields,While Phillips 66  has been heavily investing in its Midstream and Chemicals segments in order to diversify the company from the cyclical refining business in the near term the companys Refining segment continues to be the dominant factor whenAs most of you know PSX has been executing on a multiyear plan to diversify away from refining by heavily investing in its chemicals and midstream segments If you follow me you know that I have not been impressed by the companys massive investments in newThe much better news is that PSX in June  the purchase of all DCP Midstreams LP units that it did not already own As a result the upcoming Q3 report will be the first fullquarter that will include all of DCPs LP results Note that Enbridge  still owns a 132 economic interest in DCP via the General Partnership As I have opined on Seeking Alpha its likely just a matter of time before PSX buys out ENBs remaining economic interests in DCPRegardless and with DCP now firmly under the PSX umbrella the company expects to deliver strong growth in Midstream EBITDA from its integrated wellheadtomarket strategy Indeed the Midstream segment is expected to be the biggest single contributor of the 3 billion in expected midcycle EBITDA growth from the period 20222025 This is shown in the slide below from PSXs However and considering the moribund Chemicals Segment nearterm performance will likely continue to be dominated by the performance of the companys Refining Segment which has been a laggard for years when compared to its primary competitors Valero  and Marathon Petroleum  This underperformance is clearly shown in the relative fiveyear total returns performance of the three companiesYet there is some good news in PSXs Refining Segment The company has finally started to make some significant headway in improving its Refining Segments market capture and expects to achieve an incremental increase of 400 million annually via refining margin expansionMeantime PSX  which is the largest importer of Canadian Oil Sands WCS crude  is benefiting from its higher distillate yield as diesel margins remain strong as we head into the winter heating season see graphic below This is good news for PSX shareholders because as you know distillate demand is seasonal with increased consumption during the winter monthsAs you can see from the diagram above while below blowout 2022 pricing the 2023 distillate crack spread green dots has remained significantly above average and jumped higher toward the end of Q3 with the average August crack spread coming in at 110gallon That was  than the RBOB gasoline crack spread in August 080gallon As a result PSX continues to optimize its refineries for diesel Indeed on the  Brian Mandell  head of PSXs Marketing  Commercial Operations  reported that PSXs exports were up nearly 50000 bpd yoy during the quarterMeantime the recent increase in BrentWTI oil prices should mean higher margins for PSXs NGLs fractionation capacity as well as better pricing for PSXs LPG exportsAs a result and according to  consensus earnings estimates for Q3 have risen sharply from 382share 90days ago to the current estimate of 476For the year the consensus estimate is for 1571share of earnings which I believe may be on the low side given projections of only 297share in Q4 which I believe is overly pessimistic given current market conditions and the recent increase in WTI Also the EPS estimates for next year appear to be on the low side as well given PSXs strategy to reduce costs while increasing efficiencies and refining margin expansion However PSX has been talking about increasing refining margin capture for many years and it could be that the market is simply in show me modeRegardless and given PSXs current stock price of 11591 at pixel time the 1571share EPS estimates equates to a PE74x and a forward PE85x The current 420 ,6,2023-10-19,0
264,"J.B. Hunt Transport: Capacity Gains, Consumer Demand Recovery, And Share Gains Drive Growth",Following  of JB Hunt Transport Services  I recommended a buy rating due to my expectation that the business can generate aboveaverage secular growth from intermodal I believed that there was room to exceedJBHT reported 3Q23 total revenue of 316 billion 03 growth of which 155 billion was from intermodal which grew by 35 vs 3Q22 However due to faster growth in operating expenses operating income saw a decline of 101 to 241 million However on the EBITDA level EBITDA saw growth of 96 to 4294Expanding further on the subject of intermodal performance which constitutes a crucial aspect of my optimistic stance it is worth noting that although revenue experienced growth the decrease in EBIT by 117 was somewhat underwhelming The primary factors contributing to the decline were elevated equipment expenses diminished utilization rates and weakened pricing conditions However I derived positive outcomes from the results despite the fact that intermodal profits were lower This was due to the encouraging progress observed in terms of volume and box turnover which are fundamental aspects An essential piece of data for understanding volume growth is box turn performance by JBHT and its rail partners A strong box turn performance directly impacts utilization and volume growth In my opinion stronger box turns a possible return in consumer demand and capacity expansion will all contribute to sustained volume growth Regarding the latter point namely the expansion of capacity it is noteworthy that the management exhibited a positive trend by increasing the number of containers added during the third quarter of 2023 Specifically they added 1000 containers during this period albeit this figure still fell short of the average number of containers added in 2022 which stood at 4600 That said I maintain a positive outlook regarding the continuity of capacity expansion as management has reaffirmed their objective of reaching a container count of 150000 within the next 35 years as initially stated in their 1Q22 announcement Furthermore management remained confident that the necessary capacity will be available once freight activity resumes within the network With respect to the aspect of demand it is my belief that we are currently approaching the trough of the cycle as indicated by segment margins declining below 10 a range that has historically spanned from 10 to 14 Management observations regarding the destocking trend also indicate that it is probable that the conclusion of this trend is imminent Once the destocking situation concludes it is highly advantageous for JBHT as retailers are compelled to replenish their inventory sellin thereby providing JBHT with a significant temporary surge in volume Retailers are compelled to replenish their inventory in due course as there is an increase in consumer demandLooking ahead I feel optimistic about the upcoming growth prospects First and foremost I think that the increased intermodal service capability will act as a catalyst to allow trucks to gain a larger share of the market even though truck contract rates  The fact is Intermodal still offers a  over longdistance transportation Moreover I anticipate that JBHT will experience a resurgence in volume as the company intends to enhance its service and expand its capacity This will be achieved through their strategic objective of incorporating an additional 40000 containers within the next 35 years resulting in a total container count of 150000 currently 117387 Although there are concerns regarding excessive capacity it is worth mentioning that JBHT has the ability to adjust container allocation within its network in order to sustain capacity and fulfill market demands This was acknowledged by management when they mentioned the retrieval of equipment from storage in the third quarter of 2023 The numerical data also supports this claim as management has ,1,2023-10-19,0
265,Exxon Mobil: Big Market Changes,Exxon Mobil  has long been a leader in accommodating market changes Some changes are obvious like the increase in the price of oil that should lead to a very good third quarter report as well asThe decrease in the  and light oil prices is currently happening because OPEC primarily Saudi Arabia when it comes to heavy oil is cutting back on production as are otherThis movement of oil prices threatens a longstanding US refining industry profit making strategy For a very long time the United States has mostly exported the light crude produced by the unconventional wells while importing the heavy oil even heavy oil with sulfur The industry then made an extra profit by upgrading the heavy oil into the same products that were made with light oil while capturing the extra revenue of the discount to the finished productBut when that discount no longer exists then the industry does not make an extra profit that justifies the assets needed for the extra refining processes If this was a temporary phenomenon then investors could put it down to just the usual volatility in pricing that will soon fix itselfBut the Canadian completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline Threatens to change this relationship permanently This longdelayed project is now over  Even with an expected reroute in some places the pipeline should be in operation within the next couple of years no guarantees of courseThis will allow a significant amount of Canadian production that was available to the United States with the usual heavy oil discount to be exported The volume carried through the pipeline will likely be significant enough to enable the discount between heavy oil and light oil to narrow It may narrow to the point that the profit the United States has long made on importing heavy oil while exporting light oil will decrease or maybe even disappearShould that prove to be the case the refining industry will be in for at least a period of lower profits during cyclical high pointsExxon Mobil normally integrates where it has a decent upstream business As a general rule the company builds the upstream business first and then adds other divisions as a valueadded way to grow for that particular upstream businessIn the case of the Permian the company may have inadvertently begun a refining trend expansion is actually the size of most middlesized refineries standalone So while many talk about the lack of new refineries the industry is working around that by expanding existing refineries to make up for the lack of new refineries It gets the industry to the same point as building new refineriesWhats even more interesting is that this refinery will handle the light crude that the company produces in the Permian This is a variance from the industry strategy noted above of exporting the light crude while importing the heavy crude to make a profit on that spread It could mean that the spread will not be worth the effort in the future What we will have to see is how many more expansion projects happen with the idea of handling light crudeThe third quarter itself is going to benefit from some of the best oil pricing so far in the current fiscal year Most investors remember that prices peaked roughly in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and it was downhill after that This year began with a fair amount of pessimism about oil prices despite the fact that the industry by and large made decent profits at those pricesI have been reporting for some time that well breakeven points have been dropping That should of course lead to lower corporate breakeven points and a more profitable industry at various oil pricesExxon Mobil not only benefits from higher prices but it also benefits from a drive to lower costs This project has been aided by previously mentioned sales of highcost production replaced by lowcost Permian production that the new refinery expansion project will serve in the next slide that Guyana and the Permian ,56,2023-09-27,0

279,PepsiCo Q3 Earnings Preview: Time To Question The Dividend Motif,No doubt about it    is a wonderful company to own It meets a variety of criteria that qualify it as an excellent investment To name a few The company has great brand strength a welldiversified portfolio operatesHowever PepsiCo stock has been quite a weak performer lately Hence and considering the company will release its  on Tuesday Oct 10 and hold a conference call at 815 am EDT its a good time to reassess In this update I discuss the reasons forThere are several aspects that I believe are responsible for the fairly poor performance of PEP stock recently aside from the fact that the stock was definitely quite richly valued with a PE ratio in the high 20s and a free cash flow yield of just over 2For one consumers continue to be squeezed by inflation leading investors to fear that PepsiCo which owns mostly premium brands could lose market share to discount or whitelabel brands That fear is certainly justified to a certain extent given that PepsiCo saw a volume decline of 3 in its Convenient Foods segment and 1 in its Beverages segment in the second quarter For the Convenient Foods segment this is the fourth quarter that PepsiCo has reported a volume decline Figure 1However I dont think the recent decline in volumes should be overinterpreted After all isnt it the small everyday treats that can brighten up a bad day I firmly believe that people living on increasingly tight budgets are more likely to cut back on other things than to forgo the easytoobtain and cheap in absolute dollar amounts goodies that promise and deliver instant gratification So I view PepsiCos recent performance as temporary also from the perspective that yearoveryear comparisons are difficult as consumers were still much less pricesensitive in late 2021 and early 2022 Nonetheless its certainly a good idea to keep an eye on PepsiCos performance in terms of volumes while its pricing power is undeniable if you look at its performance over the past few quartersSecond its the rotation to highergrowth stocks with exciting stories AI weightloss drugs  to name just two and the fact that longterm government bonds have finally become an alternative again While dividendpaying bluechip stocks have long been referred to as a bond substitute which is itself a fallacy due to the discretionary nature of the dividend a dividend yield of less than 3 is certainly no longer that enticing And even if PEP stock is down 14 from its 52week high and now has a dividend yield of 30 its hard to argue away the attractiveness of longterm government bonds Even if PepsiCo can continue to grow its dividend at  the fiveyear CAGR it would take eight years to match the  that the 20Year Treasury currently offers  or thirteen years if PepsiCo dividend growth declines to 40 per year Figure 2 I can certainly understand why incomeoriented investors are increasingly interested in longterm bonds but since I invest for the very long term I stick with stocks because they carry no reinvestment riskFinally I think  is one aspect that makes riskaverse investors somewhat cautious against the backdrop of sharply higher interest rates As of the end of the second quarter of 2023 PepsiCo had 37 billion in net debt  roughly six times its longterm average annual free cash flow While I concede that a consumer staples company with a reasonably recessionproof business model can manage aboveaverage debt it is still worth taking note of PepsiCos pretty high debt load However investors who fear that the snack and beverage giant could suffer significantly in a higher for longer scenario should first of all keep in mind that PepsiCo currently pays a weightedaverage interest rate of only about 27 on its debtHowever a look at the maturity profile of PepsiCos bonds in Figure 3 shows that the shortterm maturities 23 of PEPs debt matures by the end of 2025 have very low average interest rat,39,2023-10-05,0

311,Energy Transfer: 9% Yield Is Too Good To Pass,Energy Transfer LP  has arguably become one of the better dividend income opportunities in the energy sector as a whole but certainly when looking at the industry for oil and gas storageThe company is at an attractive price point with a valuation in line with the rest of the sector With a yield over 9 as well I think ET displays a strong buy case right for the dividendoriented investors that want exposureET is a prominent  with a market capitalization of approximately 41 billion The company boasts an expansive and strategically significant pipeline network that stretches across an impressive 41 US states Within the energy sector Energy Transfer is a pivotal player responsible for facilitating the transportation of crucial resourcesOne of the most critical roles that ET fulfills is its substantial involvement in the movement of energy resources Specifically the company plays a central role in transporting approximately 30 of the United States natural gas supply demonstrating its indispensable contribution to the nations energy infrastructure Additionally ET is responsible for the transportation of around 35 of the nations crude oil emphasizing its role as a key player in the energy sectorThe company operates through five distinct segments each contributing to its diverse portfolio of energyrelated activities These segments encompass a wide range of functions within the energy sector providing a comprehensive and wellrounded approach to its operations One of the key segments within the company focuses on compression services In this capacity the company plays a vital role in maintaining and optimizing the transportation of energy resources By offering compression services they ensure that energy resources such as natural gas can be efficiently transported through pipelines facilitating their journey from production sites to endusersOne of the leading  from ET has to be the fact they are acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners LP  for a deal valued at 71 billion taking into account the 33 billion of debt the company hasThe deal is a major step in the progress that ET is making to solidify a growing dividend yield with further additions of FCF to the business The deal is expected to fully close in the fourth quarter of 2023 so we are still some time off from seeing the true impact of the deal in the results of ET However I am optimistic about the prospects of a steadily growing FCF yield for ET over the next decade because of itOver the years ET has had a slight volatility to the yield which I think can be largely attributed to the pandemic and the uncertainty about energy usage during that period ET cut the dividend which I think was a good idea given they have a lot of debt on hand that they also need to attend to But I think it has since become obvious that natural gas is not going to go away and even though there can be disruptions ET remains in a strong position to benefit from major market trends over the long term I would expect in 2024 that we see an increase in the dividend and reach levels closer to 035 which will be driven by EPS expansion for the business EPS growth can come from closing significant deals like acquiring CrestwoodThe most recent report from the company displayed strength in my opinion as the net income managed to reach 911 million in totalWhat ET has managed to do very well in my opinion is maintain a strong set of diversification as from where they generate their revenues and earnings The company is not heavily reliant on one source The largest one is NGL  Refined Products at 27 in total The cured oil segment for example is benefiting from the connectivity that it has to major basins of operations and the access to the US market which right now is a strong demand on domestic oil productionIn addition to the potential impact of interestrate fluctuations the ability of ET to consistently meet its debt obligations is a critical factor i,120,2023-09-07,0

315,Medical Properties Trust: Capturing Value Or Catching A Falling Knife?,Since early 2022 there has been an increased chatter around Medical Properties Trust  and its prospects to deliver solid returns for REIT investors It is a combination of many unpleasant factors that have contributedYet the overarching driver of why MPW has been so an interesting case is its defensive fundamentals ie business model on the one hand and on the other the idiosyncratic struggles which impose significant downward pressure on the MPWs market cap levelInterestingly starting from 2022 there has not been a meaningful period in which the Stock assumed an upward momentum or even traded sideways Instead it has gone from one decline to another decline providing value investors with a reason to consider opening a positionInvestors who previously thoughtA while ago I  on MPW stating that the talks around potential dividend cut overshadow the underlying value Since then the dividend cut took place and the market cap continued to plummetMy thesis points revolved around the underlying resiliency of MPWs operations For example almost full occupancy positive NOI and successful transactions on the asset monetization frontI also argued that the leverage while relatively high from the capital structure perspective looking at the ICR level the debt coverage remained very solid In other words my firm opinion was that MPW will eventually manage to reduce its leverage and successfully roll over the nearterm maturitiesThis in combination with depressed multiples rendered the overall investment case interestingYet at the same time I pinpointed the potential downside risks stemming from continued uncertainty on the operator front Unfortunately this has materialized and sent the stock price 30 below the level when my article was circulatedHowever now that MPW is down 65 since the first struggles began ie tenant default risks value investors including me are left with no choice but to revisit the thesis once againI am fully aware that the same logic was prevalent in earlier periods as well but on a 3month basis the price decline is just too steep to ignoreOn top of that since the publication of my article we have received a couple of positive updates on the Steward and Prospect tenant situation as well as new data points associated with asset divestituresAt the same time MPW has approached a deep value territory with even the forwardlooking PFFO trading at 32xNo matter which valuation metric you look at MPW is cheap both on absolute and relative termsYet the devil lies in the details and prudent value investors have to be very careful to avoid making a long decision where the odds are stacked against normalization in the underlying cash flow generation or fundamentalsIn my opinion one of the main reasons why the multiples are so depressed across the board is that the market has not yet fully calibrated the longterm path of MPWs cash flows In other words there is a significant risk premium attached to MPW because of the inherent uncertainty about its tenants refinancings and the effects of the higher for longer scenarioFor me it is clear that MPW will not become the next Arated REIT that is associated with stability and dividend predictability for longterm investorsHowever I am interested in getting compensated for the elevated risk premium and reallocating once the situation normalizes ie risk premium contracts and multiples have bounced back to a more reasonable levelsIn my view for this to happen MPW has to deliver on two aspectsOne of the main drivers behind the massive decline in MPWs stock price is the uncertainty around MPWs ability to pay off its debt burden which going into the new era of higher for longer scenario was not that optimal especially if compared to the sector peersAs of now MPW has a net debt to adjusted EBITDAre of 68x These days everything that is above 5x could be deemed suboptimal implying an elevated exposure ,190,2023-10-17,0

329,FTAIP: A Probable 18% Yield To First Call Seems Worth The Risk,FTAI Aviation  is the result of a spinoff between it and FTAI Infrastructure  which occurred in August 2022 Post spin it is a Cayman Islands exempted company which  is one of a number of preferred issues of FTAI including FTAIO  and  It is an  issue currently tradingMore importantly FTAIP is likely to be called The preferred will switch to floating at 3month Libor  688 in September 2024 At about 125 for current Libor this is a very unattractive rate for the firm relative to other preferred and debt Rather than letting that occur the firm is likely to call FTAIP which would produce a 18 return to first call for current investors We believe this is an attractive return verse the risk investors are taking onIf FTAIP were allowed to switch to floating at 3month Libor  688 the firm would have to pay approximately a 125 yield at current rates However FTAI has been able to recently issue new preferred at 95 fixed FTAIM potentially saving FTAI 3 in interest by refinancing FTAIP into new preferred Alternately FTAI debt is currently rated BB by Fitch While not investment grade borrowing for other similar BB debt is currently available at about 8 This implies FTAI would save 4 by refinancing this preferred into debt instead of letting it switch to floating Finally management has been using excess cash flow to buy back discounted debt in the recent past 200 million worth of discounted 2025 debt was bought in 2022 Hence there is a lot of incentive for management to refinance this preferred rather than to let it float and a number of potential different alternatives for them to do soAs stated similar debt to FTAIs BB has been refinanced at 8 recently Also the firm itself was able to issue new preferred FTAIM at 9 Both imply the debt and preferred market remain open to the firm Furthermore the firm has been producing a decent amount of cash flow from both ongoing operations and asset sales Finally FTAIPs debt schedule is reasonably spaced and its coverage is goodFitch likely rates FTAI below investment grade BB due primarily to its high debt load a whopping 83 of FTAIs book assets CFM56 plane engines and airframes However these assets are of high quality in high demand and very likely undervalued As most will be aware airlines have been doing very well post Covid Their problem is not having enough usable airframes and crews not too many Furthermore FTAI leases exclusively CFM56 engines and airframes to these airlines These engines are not only the most popular aircraft engine in the world but they are also Sales of these used assets further support the notion they are more valuable than what is reported under GAAP accounting rules In 2022 FTAIs aviation leasing segment showed a substantial net profit from asset sales They received 208 million in asset sales revenue but the cost of these assets on the books was only 159 million This is more than a 30 premium to book value strongly suggesting GAAP reporting undervalues FTAIs assets Fitch cant give a firm credit for this implied value but we can I estimate true debt to assets is approximately 58 much lower than the 83 implied by standard GAAP required balance sheet depreciation This occurs because GAAP depreciation on these assets tends toward 1525 years thanks to bonus depreciation and MACRS despite the average CFM56 engine having more than a 30year useful life Were GAAP to record FTAIs net debt  assets as being 58 they would undoubtedly receive a higher rating than BB from FitchFTAIs Debt  EBITDA is also a pretty solid 35x and expected to continue to stay within the 34x range by management This too implies a rating much better than BBUnfortunately Fitch cant consider implied asset values above book It must use GAAP accounting figures Hence the discrepancy which knowledgeable investors can take advantage ofWe would be remiss if we didnt also note FTAIs stock can ,35,2023-10-21,0
330,Bunge: The Top Pick For Dividend Growth In Agriculture,The agriculture sector is a minefield for investors looking for consistent dividendcapital growthThats because agriculture is a highly volatile business at the very top of a number of supply chains including food obviously and energy After all a lot of cropsHence the industry tends to come with low margins and a very cyclical nature which makes it hard to find companies that are able to deliver consistent returnsFor longterm investments I prefer two industries in this sectorIn the second group I like two stocks ArcherDanielsMidland  and  the giant that announced a somewhat groundbreaking merger this yearAs I havent  BG since May its time for another deep dive as I believe that BG is one of the best dividend stocks in this sector The company is doing tremendously well in a challenging environment It is investing in growth the Viterra merger significantly expands its moat and its valuation is highly attractiveSo lets get to the detailsBunge Limited is a large global agribusiness and food company with vertically integrated operations spanning from farmers to consumersThe company operates through four main segments Agribusiness Refined and Specialty Oils Milling and Sugar and BioenergyThese segments cover a wide range of activities and are further categorized into Core and Noncore operations that help farmers sell their goods allow food producers to acquire important input products and allow for global agriculture trade to move smoothlyNow the company is taking things to the next levelIn June the company announced the merger with Viterra the agriculture division of mining giant Glencore The deal adds new capabilities allows to capture a bigger part of global agriculture demand and increases earnings capabilitiesFor example whereas Bunge has a major footprint in processing and downstream operations Viterra is a giant in merchandising and handlingViterra has more than 270 global storage facilities the ability to market more than 134 million metric tons of grains 29 port terminals and both grain and sugar millsIt also has 15 crushing plants and seven biodiesel plantsThanks to this deal BG also acquired a bigger trade footprint in the US Canada the EU and Australia Prior to the merger it was mainly focused on grain origination in BrazilThe headquarters of the merged company will be in St Louis MissouriBG shareholders will own 70 of the combined company and assume 98 billion of Viterra debt which is associated with 90 billion in readily marketable inventories RMIAlso as we can see below while Viterra has more in annual revenues it has a lower net income and EBITDA suggesting much lower margins related to a different footprint in the industryThe combined company will have 172 billion in net debt and a net leverage ratio of 16x I believe the combined company will have an investmentgrade credit rating as both Bunge and Viterra are investmentgrade companiesThis brings me to the Bunge dividendBG is no highyield company It currently pays a 06625 per share per quarter dividend As investors have to pay 10670 to buy one share this translates to a yield of 25If we take a closer look at the overview below we see that this dividend is protected by a sub20 payout ratio The company also has very satisfying grades on its Seeking Alpha dividend scorecard which means it is scoring favorably compared to its consumer staple peersOver the past five years the dividend has been hiked by 62 per year  on averageThe company has a track record of two consecutive years of dividend growth If it werent for the pandemic the company would have had an uninterrupted streak of dividend growth since the early 2000s when it started paying a dividendBG is a play on dividend safety not dividend growthI also believe that BG is a great combination with other peers For example when combining BG with a stock like PepsiCo  meaning to own both,14,2023-10-03,0
331,Delta Air Lines Is Still Head And Shoulders Above The Rest,Airline stocks have seen a very turbulent 2023 After low fuel prices early in the year and the promise of a strong summer macroeconomic fears which includedUnited Airlines  CEO Scott Kirby grabbed the headlines when he stated in that companys 3rd quarter earnings call that the lowcost carrier model was broken and unsustainable and that the majority of US airline industry revenue and profit growth would come from Delta and United Scott Kirbys style has long included comparisons of UALs performance to other airlines when he took the helm at UAL seven years ago he said his goal was to deliver performance comparable to DAL which has been regarded for years as the industrys financial leader Not only did Kirby take a swipe at the lowcost carrier segment but also at American Airlines  where Kirby was employed before heading from N Texas to Chicago to lead UnitedUniteds strategies over the past year have been very similar to those which Delta implemented over the past 15 years increase premium revenue improve operational reliability improve the customer experience and onboard product reduce the reliance on regional jets while growing the mainline large jet fleet and increase aircraft gauge or the average number of seats per flight United has its own distinctives including a historically larger percentage of revenue from large coastal markets than Delta and a larger percentage of revenue from international markets but the two posted not only the closest revenue and profits the two have recorded in years but also similar bottom line results The following data highlights the revenue performance between the two megacarriers from  and s 3rd quarter earnings releasesWhile Delta and United notched similar impressive results competitor American didnt fare so well while smaller Alaska  also a legacy pre1978 interstate airline had a decent 3rd quarter The lowcost carriers including Southwest  have yet to report but are not expected to come close to the strength which Delta and United showed The factors which have helped Delta and United outperform in the current environment include being able to grow revenue and profits in an aviation system that is heavily constrained due to new aircraft delivery delays esp from Boeing  as well as Air Traffic Control staffing shortages which have cut the capacity which a number of US airports can handle Add in soaring labor costs and growing shortages of skilled aviation labor and the ability of the lowcost carrier model to effectively compete against legacy carriers has never been more challenging   and s guidance and full year 2023 earnings highlight some of the distinctives between the two companies It is clear that while United had a strong summer season they underperformed Delta earlier in the year and are expected to do so in the winter as they usually do United has one of the smallest positions in Florida among US airlines and has a smaller Caribbean operation than American or Delta In addition Delta earns far more revenue in the other category than any other US airline and likely any other airline in the world Well get into what is in that other category but it is clear that a big part of Deltas financial difference with United even as well as United is operating right now is due to a much greater level of revenue diversification which is a key driver behind Deltas higher profitsWith an understanding of current industry dynamics lets look at Deltas distinctives and how they position that company to remain financially at the top of the industry The underlying principle that underlies Deltas financial success is that it has spent decades esp the two decades since 911 reshaping itself and thinking much further out strategically than any other airline It has also intentionally articulated its goals and strategies to investors and has executed them to a level of consistently that has been rare in the airline industry While ,44,2023-10-24,0

350,Do Not Buy NextEra Energy Partners: High Interest Rates Broke The Growth Story,NextEra Energy Partners  once a highflying dividend stock has seen its stock price languish amidst higher interest rates With the stock yielding nearly 7 dividend investors may be wondering if it is time to back the truck up so to speak Investors mayHeading into 2022 NEP was one of the biggest winners in the dividend space offeringI see that my colleagues have a very bullish view of the stockWith the stock offering its most attractive valuation ever in terms of dividend yield I searched hard for reasons to join the bandwagon  but unfortunately came to the conclusion that downside or at least underperformance appeared more likely hereI dont intend to rehash the business story here  my colleagues have written  But here is a quick refresher on the company and recent financial results NEP is an energy company mainly focused on renewable energy generation The company does have some pipeline exposure but it is working on selling off those assets to become a pureplay renewable energy investmentThe idea is that its customers sign longterm contracts agreeing to pay for a base amount of energy generation at a certain price NEP typically acquires these assets from its parent company NextEra Energy  In some sense NEP can be thought of as being quite similar to net lease REITs NNN REITs due to the longterm contracts and similarity to sale and leaseback transactions NEPs counterparties have an average BBB credit rating and the company has increased its customer roster rapidly over the past several yearsIn its most recent quarter NEP saw both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution CAFD decline YOY as growth from new projects was unable to offset declines at existing projectsManagement expects growth to pick up in the second half of the year with up to 860 million in projected CAFD for the full year Management has reiterated expectations for 12 to 15 average distribution growth through 2026 but on the  noted that it may be more at the low end of that rangeI suspect that the commitment to the distribution growth guidance is whats helping many investors maintain their conviction in spite of the growing warning signs from the macro environmentAt first glance NEP looks like an outright steal trading at its highest distribution yield ever at around 7 while management is guiding for at least 12 forward growthBut that is not the right way to look at it Instead investors should be asking how believable the guidance is Consider that essentially all the cash flow growth in 2022 came from new projects With NEP seeing declines at existing projects this year it is clear that we should not be expecting growth if at all from existing projects at least not on a consistently recurring basis This is one way in which NEP differs from NNN REITs which typically have annual lease escalators and thus can post some growth even without external acquisitionsThe stock currently yields just shy of 7 Based on the high end of CAFD guidance NEP will generate around 452 in CAFD per share in 2023 for those checking the math I note that the market cap commonly reported is not including the units owned by NEE The stock is trading at a roughly 9 CAFD yield Property plant and equipment increased by  implying around an 85 yield on new acquisitions The acquisition yield is even lower if we compare 2022 results with those from 2019 at around 68That calculation suggests that funding new acquisitions through retained cash flow will not create excess shareholder value Another way to put it if NEP only used retained cash flow to fund new acquisitions then the best that shareholders could hope for is around 2 growth Issuing stock to fund acquisitions may be dilutive or only mildly accretive at bestBut with management still committing to their 12 distribution growth guidance that implies that they may be looking to issue debt to fund acquisitions I note that NEP has 63 ,106,2023-08-30,0
351,Why I'm Convinced Energy Transfer Is The Best 9%-Yielder On The Market,I decided to go with a very catchy title While I obviously like some attention for my articles Im not using clickbait I honestly believe that  is the best 9yielding stockOn June 20 I wrote an  titled Since then the stock has returned 11 lowering the dividend yield to 9 for new investorsHence I considered going with the title  However that would have been a bit too much It would also suggest that the stock might go up without any correctionsI cannot promise thatWhat I can say is that Energy Transfer has become a highyielding gem After having issues in the past causing the companyAmong midstream companies with a market cap of more than 5 billion Energy Transfer has the highest yield 9Given its improved fundamentals dividend safety and strong business I honestly believe that ET is the best place for investors seeking a 9 yield Not just in the energy industryNow before we continue I need to mention that Energy Transfer is a Master Limited Partnership MLP which means that the company is not a traditional CCorp These companies are taxexempt if 90 of their income comes from qualifying resources  its a bit like REITs Hence MLPs issue K1 formsFor some investors this has tremendous benefits However it also means that some foreign investors may not be able to buy ETET shares are called units and their dividends are called distributions To avoid confusion both terms may be used in this article So please forgive me if its not entirely correctWhats great about capitalism is that we can choose how to invest our moneyFor example when dealing with the energy sector there are three main ways to get the job doneIn this case I left one segment out midstreamHeres an overview of how contracts are often structuredLast year Goldman Sachs  came out with a  making the case for midstream companiesAlthough I usually dont use comments that old it needs to be said that everything Goldman mentioned is still validFor example midstream fundamentals are the healthiest on recordHigher energy prices have supported faster earnings growth and healthier clients Also to add my own comment shifting global geopolitics has caused North America to become an even more important export nationBefore the pandemic most midstream companies were still aggressively expanding their networks Most are still expanding but were now at a point where most companies are selffunding operations as past investments have resulted in strong free cash flow Hence the chances of dividend cuts are also much lowerIn general midstream companies are in much better shape compared to a few years agoAlso because midstream companies are not directly dependent on oil and gas prices they have a subdued correlation to crude oilUsing Goldman Sachs data we see that midstream has the highest correlation with global infrastructure stocks and value equitiesThis brings me to Energy TransferWith a market cap of more than 40 billion Energy Transfer is a giantFounded in 1996 and headquartered in Dallas Texas the company is a highly diversified midstream player operating a number of key segments including equity investments in companies like Sunoco LP  which is engaged in motor fuel distribution to dealers and customers operating a number retail storesFor example in its biggest segment the companys operations cover pipeline and trucking transportation operating terminals and acquisition and marketing services ET operates approximately 11315 miles of crude oil pipelines and has equity interests in various pipeline systems Revenue generation is through tariffs and crude oil acquisition and marketing activitiesEnergy Transfer also manages around 11600 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines and owns storage facilities in Texas and OklahomaTheir services involve transporting natural gas from production sources to endusers and storage facilities Revenue is generated through capacity reservat,68,2023-09-21,0

356,BDC Weekly Review: How A Rising Term Premium Will Impact BDCs,Welcome to another installment of our BDC Market Weekly Review where we discuss market activity in the Business Development Company BDC sector from both the bottomup  highlighting individual news and events  as well as the topdown  providing an overview of the broader marketWe also try to add some historical context as well as relevant themes that look to be driving the market or that investors ought to be mindful of This update covers the period through the second week of OctoberBDCs were marginally up this week as markets whipsawed on geopolitical concerns and higherthanexpected inflation readings Despite a positive week the sector remains down around 25 on the monthValuations have recovered slightly from the recent slide but stand around 5 below the recent peakManyWe can see this rise in the term premium a couple of different ways One academic definition of the term premium shows that its moved into positive territory and is not far off the top of the rangePerhaps a more intuitive definition of the term premium is simply the difference between 10Y and 2Y Treasury yields as shown below This has risen as well but remains well below its longerterm rangeWhat drives the term premium A common answer is the debt load  the higher the debt the higher the term premium investors require and viceversa US debt outstanding has been rising sharply over the past couple of years which has now been followed by a rising term premiumHowever todays dynamic is unusual as historically the term premium behaved in the opposite way than we would expect  higher debt loads coincided with a falling term premium and viceversa This is likely because higher debt loads have been associated with recessions and during recessions inflation falls giving investors more confidence in buying longerdated bonds while at the same time investors also seek safety in higherquality assets boosting demand for TreasuriesRather the historically downtrending term premium appeared to be driven by a stronger level of inflation anchoring due to increased Fed credibility and transparency A subdued level of inflation volatility until recently has also helped as well as strong buying of US Treasuries by foreigners particularly foreign central banks given an increase in global FX reservesForeign holdings as a share of Americas national debt have now been on the decline falling to around 27 while commercial banks have been sellers as well BTFP has mitigated this somewhat and the Fed itself is allowing Treasuries to roll off its balance sheetInflation volatility has jumped sharply though it appears to be slowing down once again Feds credibility has been dinged however longterm inflation expectations remain low suggesting that inflation remains well anchored across markets and the sharp hawkish turn by the Fed has helped shore up its inflationfighting credentialsOverall the term premium will likely remain elevated and higher than what we saw in the decade preceding COVID however two of the three pillars remain mostly in place which suggests that the term premium is unlikely to move back to the top of its multidecade rangeThe most direct impact of an elevated term premium on BDCs is through their cost of debt Many BDCs were able to refinance their fixedrate bonds in 2021 at what now look like incredibly low levels This was because both Treasury yields and credit spreads were both very low in 2021For example BXSL issued 5 bonds in just over 14 months starting in July 2020 at coupons that are miles below todays Treasury yields locking in an amazing net interest margin for yearsOne of these bonds already rolled off in July and others will follow in subsequent years Unless rates collapse from here this means that many BDCs will be refinancing bonds with coupons of 23 to bonds with coupons of 65 in effect more than doubling their cost of funding on each issueSome BDCs like BXSL have longerterm debt ,30,2023-10-20,0

361,Enterprise Products Partners: One Of The Better Dividend Payers In The Space,If you are looking for a dividenddistributing company that has perhaps some of the most solid margins in the energy sector then a top pick of mine is Enterprise Products Partners LP  right now TheEPD serves as a vital player in the midstream energy sector providing essential solutions to producers and consumers in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids segments Moreover the company extends its reach into other critical sectors such as crude oil petrochemicals and refined products This diverse operational scope is structured into four distinct segments NGL Pipelines  Services Crude Oil Pipelines  Services Natural Gas Pipelines  Services and Petrochemical  Refined Products ServicesThe last for the company showcased strength as the DCF remained high at 17 billion There were fewer favorable commodity prices in the last quarter as compared to Q2 FY2022 But that hasnt stopped EPD from still being a strong dividend distributorThe company has managed to accelerate the total asset growth of the business and over the last decade it has averaged a  If this can be maintained as a result of acquiring more companies and yield pipeline expansion then I think EPD looks very attractive as an investment But it wont be just expansion that will result in higher valued assets The fact that they already have the assets and the necessity for natural gas and crude oil growth each year is sufficient enough to result in it growing tooAs for how EPD has been able to leverage this into stronger earnings I think that they have done a great job as commodity prices of both oil and gas have appreciated in the last couple of years Both seem to be trending upwards as well and production cuts are resulting in higher pricesEven though there is a general sentiment that renewables are going to make up a larger portion of energy generation EPD is still investing quite heavily in  related to oil and gas pipelines Approved and underdevelopment projects have a total value of 41 billion so far Looking ahead several projects are expected to be in service as of 2024 and 2025 which supports the prospects of growing distributable cash flows as EPD expands the asset baseEven as the company has been growing its FCF over the years the relation between it and the price has been declining EPD still posts a premium in pfcf in comparison to the sector of about 5213 on a FWD basis I dont think that should construed as the buy case here though EPD is still a very appealing company to be in given the reliable dividend it has maintained through the years that is what investors and the market are valuing On a pe basis it looks a little more realistic as it trades more or less in line with the broader sector median right now EPD still equals a buy in my book primarily because of the dividend yield of over 7 and the fact there are still several ongoing projects in the pipeline that further solidify the position of the company in the marketsI think that for EPD the dividend remains incredibly stable as we will see below the FCF of the business has been incredibly stable throughout the commodity cycle of oil for example With the last quarter having 17 billion in distributable cash flows it more than covers the TTM dividends paid of 41 billion on an annualized basisVolume elves remain stable for the company and I think this underscores the capability the company inhabits to possibly post even stronger earnings in the coming quarters If commodity prices keep ticking upwards going into the colder months of the year I think EPD is ripe to post higher distributable cash flows then the previous 17 billion Over the last 24 years the dividend has been raised and this would add more support to that practice and let EPD perhaps continue doing it for another 24 years as long as they maintain this fortress of assets they have accumulatedEPDs unitholders are exposed to a significant risk factor that arises from the company,38,2023-10-29,0

367,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,19,2023-10-17,0

384,Spirit AeroSystems: Another 737 Max Production Issue,Recent findings by  highlight significant production concerns for Boeings  737 Max specifically related to the aft pressure bulkheads incorrectly drilled holes Spirit AeroSystems  manufactures most of these bulkheads BoeingSpirit released a  claiming they have changed its manufacturing process to address the issue suggesting its close to delivering the fixed bulkheads Management believes there will not be a material impact on its delivery guidance for the year related to this issue and there is no immediate safety of flight concern associated with this issue for the 737 fleet and that the inservice fleet may continue to operateSpiritThe Air Current report does not tell us what portion of these have Spiritmanufactured aft pressure bulkheads but my gut tells me that all the 737s will require inspection and potential rework The duration of these fixes could take weeks or months depending on the manufacturing process and the FAAs response timeThe aftermath of this disclosure resulted in Spirits stock plummeting by 25 marking a 35 decrease yeartodateSpirit is a key supplier for Boeing and there is no formidable alternative for what it does if the OEMs want to avoid taking on the work themselves Despite Spirits indispensable role as a supplier to Boeing it has encountered rising costs and accumulating losses aggravated by unfavorable contract conditions and evident missteps in executionSpirits position in the supply chain means it will trade at a significant discount relative to its peers But Spirits customers rely on them to be an effective supplier And while this is a problematic execution environment Spirit has stumbled more than its peers However I believe there is a gap between Spirits critical role in the industry and the value it generatesThe present issue mirrors the earlier  in April 2023 related to the vertical fin attachment on the 737s which provides precedence to a path forward The blueprint from the vertical fin recall led to a momentary halt in deliveries for the inspection and adjustments Boeings proactive examination and potential rectifications on existing 737s and no disruptions for aircraft currently in service Overall this rework took about three months to resolveFinancially the direct fallout from the vertical fin issue was approximately 30m of which 17 million was reflected in the first quarter 2023 financial results The costs stemming from the current bulkhead problem might be in the same ballpark but Spirits continual cash outflows could compound these losses For Spirit to salvage its margins and cash flow it must refine its execution strategy Moreover given the upcoming debt refinancing in 1H24 12b bond due in 2025 Spirit could benefit from renegotiating contract terms contingent on improved executionBefore the aft pressure bulkhead issue Spirit was on track to deliver 380390 737 shipsets to Boeing for the full year 2023 during its Q2 earnings call management anticipated 211 deliveries in the second half of 2023 or 35 per month which is reasonable given they have the capacity to produce 42 per month However the current issue will lead to at least some nearterm delivery delays so I do not expect Spirit to meet its delivery guidanceFor Spirit this is more than a financial hiccup it underscores persistent operational challenges which if not addressed can erode customer and investor confidence making Spirits recovery even more complicatedThe challenges Spirit is facing are undeniably daunting Their track record of operational challenges and guidance reductions has rightfully made investors distrustful Nonetheless Spirit is needed in the supply chain for now and its focus should be streamlining operations If Spirit can quickly resolve this issue and demonstrate better execution they stand a chance to rebound from this setback Drawing parallels with the vertical fin issue no drastic measures are anticipated with the,0,2023-10-26,0

386,Paramount: An Immensely Misunderstood Linear Networks Business,Please Not Another Article About Streaming Dont worry this wont be yet another article mainly about whether streaming will work or not and yet I wont come around to say a few words about itIThe asset falls under the linear TV is dying category on Wall Street and is in my opinion a very misunderstood asset which is far more attractive than it appears To begin with here is a brief overview of the performance over the last few yearsIt is unfortunately very difficult to get an accurate picture of CBS because 1 Paramount has had a significant negative impact on OIBDA over the entire period please note that in 2018 the results of each division are skewed by the inclusion of Paramount at the time called CBS All Access 2 the profitability of each division is difficult to figure out and 3 CBS has been integrated into the results of the other Linear Networks since 2022 which means there is no accurate data available for the last yearHowever lets get into the three segments Advertising Affiliate and Licensing The revenue mix consists mainly of advertising during sports programs prime time nonsports programming and news as well as political advertising As can be seen historically revenue in this area can fluctuate greatly due on the one hand to the cyclical nature of the business tied to the economy but also due to the rotating broadcasting rights of the Superbowl and NCAA Championship Games as well as the political cycleTo better understand the value of the advertising business it makes sense to break down the revenue into its components According to media  CBS generated around 1 billion in NFL advertising revenue in the 2122 season That year CBS did not have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl It is important to note that the Super Bowl alone has an  of around 550600 million on the overall result By my own estimate the remaining advertising revenue from sports primarily PGA Tour NCAA and UEFA CL accounts for another 700 million I assume here that these content rights like the NFL will also be amortized over the entire business and advertising revenue will therefore only account for around 75 of the future license fees which will be sub 850 million as will become more clear below This means that in an off year without the Superbowl around 17 billion in advertising revenues are generated with sports and in a year with the Superbowl around 23 billion excluding the other smaller sports rights or about 3050 of the overall advertising business On top of that there is political advertising Here too the actual revenue is very difficult to estimate Political ads are generally very high margin according to our own estimates well above 50 which has the very simple reason that politicians do not think in terms of return on investment in the economic sense but in electoral votes which means that the financial incentives will always be to use the raised capital as extensively as possible According to my own analysis based on business reports from the big four broadcasters CBS Fox ABC and NBC as well as owners of tv stations such as Gray Television I estimate the bottomline impact to be around 350450 million so political ads revenue should be conservatively somewhere around 800 million in political yearsThe remaining revenue is divided between news and other programming I estimate that in 2022 advertising revenue was around 485 billion due to the lack of revenue from several sporting events offset by political adsThis means that on an adjusted basis 50 of Advertising revenue comes from revenue sources that a are very acyclical and b historically show an upward trend in Advertising spending Only 50 of the Advertising business is thus affected strongly by secular decline And CBS as the broadcaster with the largest reach and the highest rated content should be even less affected than its peers as will become clearer later Th,120,2023-09-22,0
387,Devon Energy: Ignored Oil Play,The potential      should make   even more appealing The independent energy company trades at yearlyDevon Energy was oddly left out of the recent rally in oil The stock now trades at multiyear lows even despite the big potential merger in the energy space and oil prices that spiked to 90bblExxon Mobil is potentially bidding for Pioneer Natural Resources in a move to boost oil production from the Permian Basin Exxon Mobil actually hit an alltime high right prior to news ofWhile the details of a potential 60 billion merger are unknown and might not even happen the interesting aspect is the valuation disconnect between Devon and Pioneer here Devon trades at only 66x forward EPS estimates while Pioneer trades at 99x EPS targets and Exxon Mobil is rumored as willing to pay another 10 premium for Pioneer on top of the rally on FridayEven Exxon Mobil now trades at 120x forward EPS targets The stock market is oddly favoring the energy giant over the independent producers hence one reason the company is probably targeting Pioneer The deal could be very accretive with the use of cash though shareholders are unlikely to want Exxon Mobil to pile on a bunch of debt againDevon Energy continues to boost oil production with guidance for Q3 production reaching 322K bd to 330K bd up from 323K bd back in Q2 Oil production growth reached 8 YoY and total production hit 662K boedThe odd part here is that Pioneer Resources only produced 369K bd of oil during Q2 with total production at 710K boed The independent energy company had oil production at 52 of total production slightly above the 49 oil production levels at DevonOne has to really question the valuation discrepancy between Pioneer with a potential offer for 60 billion and Devon Energy trading with a current market cap of only 28 billion The issue really isnt the valuation for Pioneer at 60 billion with forecasts for annual free cash flow topping 5 billion annually with WTI prices at 80bblDevon now offers investors a massive dividend opportunity The energy company pays a fixed 020 quarterly dividend amounting to a 18 dividend yield while the variable amount hit 029 during Q2 and the higher oil prices are likely to help boost this amountBased on a consistent 049 quarterly dividend Devon would pay a 196 annual dividend offering a 45 dividend yield On top of these dividend payouts the company repurchased 38 million shares for 200 million during Q2 and the current stock weakness along with oil prices rallying to 90 provides an ideal opportunity to buy very cheap sharesThe key investor takeaway is that Devon Energy just appears an ignored energy stock despite strong profits and capital returns Exxon Mobil might be chasing Pioneer due to Permian Basis resources and a CEO looking to retire making a deal more possible but Devon Energy is the much cheaper play hereInvestors in Pioneer Natural Resources should use any offer from Exxon Mobil to flip the investment into Devon Energy One can sell Pioneer at alltime highs and flip that investment into Devon at multiyear lowsStone Fox Capital aka Mark Holder is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance He is also Series 65 licensed and has 30 years of investing experience including 10 years as a portfolio manager  The information contained herein is for informational purposes only Nothing in this article should be taken as a solicitation to purchase or sell securities Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion or consult a financial advisor Investing includes risks including loss of principal Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investmen,72,2023-10-08,0

390,Rivian: Buy The Panic (Rating Upgrade),Rivian Automotive  saw its share price decline by onefifth on Thursday after the electric vehicle company announced that it would raise more debt in order to finance the production ramp of the R1T and R1S In aI rated Rivian  due to the companys narrowing losses and raised guidance in terms of productionAccording to the companys thirdquarter  which was released at the beginning of the week Rivian produced 16304 electric vehicles at its manufacturing plant in Illinois in Q323 showing 17 quarter over quarter growth The company also delivered 15564 vehicles which was an improvement of 23 compared to the previous quarterIn the first nine months of the year Rivian produced 39691 electric vehicles showing 177 year over year growth The electric vehicle company has guided for 52 thousand electric vehicles to be produced in Illinois this year meaning the company would have to produce another 12309 electric vehicles in the fourthquarter which should be easily achievable Based on Rivians thirdquarter accomplishments the EV firm would only have to achieve 75 of its Q323 production volume to meet guidance a target that I believe will be easily surpassedThe Q323 production update demonstrates that Rivian has made significant progress in terms of growing its production and I now believe that the EV company will be able to fly past its recently raised production goal of 52 thousand EV unitsAssuming a stable production volume quarter over quarter in Q423 no growth Rivian would be on track to produce approximately 56 thousand electric vehicles in FY 2023 If Rivian were to grow fourthquarter production at the average sequential production rate achieved between Q123 and Q323 317 then Rivian would report 21478 EVs produced in Q423Rivian has said in a  filing that it seeks to raise 15B in convertible senior notes due 2030  an option for another 225M in a private offering which of course poses a dilution risk to investors However considering how much progress Rivian has made in terms of growing its production and how solid the balance sheet already is I believe investors are overreacting to the debt raiseRivian is burning through a lot of cash and a debt raise at some point was expected Rivian burned through approximately 23B in cash in the first six months of the year or about 115B per quarter The debt raise is not an existential issue for the EV company however as it carried 102B in cash on its balance including short term investments enough by current cash burn rates to last at least until the end of FY 2024 Rivian also carries very little debt on its balance sheet and can easily handle additional debtRivian is commanding a decent valuation multiplier factor although the EV company is not yet profitable However Rivian is still significantly cheaper than Lucid Group  and Rivian has pulled way ahead of the company in terms of productiondelivery volume as wellTesla  is still by far the most highlyvalued electric vehicle company  with a PS ratio of 64X  as it is the leader in the industry has a global production and distribution network in place and is already profitableRivian is expected to achieve revenues of 685B in FY 2024 which implies a year over year top line growth rate of 59 With a pricetorevenue ratio of 25X Rivian is no longer as outrageously valued as it was in FY 2022 and the 20 drop on Thursday implies a much more favorable risk profileI believe Rivians risk profile has quite considerably decreased following Thursdays 20 decline in my opinion This is because the EV company reported material progress in terms of growing its production at the beginning of the week and investors are panicking over the debt offering which makes no sense to me Rivian has a very solid balance sheet a mountain of cash and very little debt With delivery growth also soaring Rivian doesnt seem to have a demand problem eitherI have stayed on the side,68,2023-10-07,0
391,Comstock Resources: Swing Producer,Comstock Resources  has often noted the low production costs in presentations to shareholders But this is only part of the picture Antero Resources  for example has noted that the Haynesville is the swing production area that usuallyThis company has some of the best operating costs in the industryAn excellent margin is certainly an accomplishment However there also has to be sufficient production volume to provide a relatively fast payback Otherwise competitors with lower margins but more volume orAlso competitors with a higher value production may have a lower margin percentage but could still be more profitable because the absolute margin combined with the well production level could prove attractiveYet the Haynesville has long been known to be the swing production areaThe Haynesville despite those low operating costs is the region where the rig count usually declines significantly At least some of this is due to the fact that the Haynesville is a dry gas area Antero Resources operates in an area that has rich gas parts as well as dry gas So even if the dry gas production has to stop drilling oftentimes the rich gas still provides a decent return to justify activity Antero Resources itself has been drilling rich gas for some time to take advantage of the extra value that liquids add to the production stream Comstock Resources does not have that optionIt turns out that the breakeven costs of dry gas producers in the Haynesville Area are relatively high are relatively low then obviously the drilling and completion costs have to be relatively expensive for the production volume in the Haynesville It is the only thing left that raises the costs to the comparison shown above that makes the Haynesville the swing productionThis comparison actually comes from an older presentation But based upon recent activity the comparison still appears to be validThe other big deal is that Antero Resources has positioned itself to get superior pricing as shown on the left part of the slide Antero Resources actually has two pricing boosts One of those comes from the liquids adding value to the revenue stream The other is the ability to send product to strong pricing markets as shown above to get a premium price compared to many competitors Many others end up with a discount Comstock is kind of locked into lower prices natural gas prices because management hedged The actual price received was considerably below what Antero Resources Received Combine that with the fact that Comstock Resources does not produce enough of the value added products to raise its average selling prices and it quickly becomes apparent why this company is located in the swing producer basin This company closely follows the fortunes of natural gas That is not true as much for Antero Resources which produces a lot of products besides just natural gasNow this situation could easily change as more natural gas export ability comes online in the near future But for the time being Comstock Resources appears to have a competitive disadvantage by focusing on dry gas production in the HaynesvilleThe higher costs also show as negative Free Cash FlowWhen you have higher costs at least compared to the average selling price then raising production during a period of low prices even if wise often results in negative free cash flowNow Antero Resources sold a fair amount of hedges as management noted because they believe that natural gas prices will strengthen in the future This is based upon the lower rig activity among dry gas producers Here you have a company reporting higher production that will be there when those anticipated stronger natural gas prices arrive This is two different ways to have exposure to higher natural gas pricesLow production costs and leading margins mentioned by Comstock Resources play a key part in profitability But they are not the only determinants of that profitability Other important varia,11,2023-10-15,0

393,Boeing: Look Beyond Temporary Issues Towards Overall Trajectory,The Boeing Company  is having trouble recovering to its past glory The combination of problems revolving around 737 MAX and supply chain disruption due to the pandemic has created serious challenges for the company Throughout the past fewBoeing is going through a temporary problem Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems  found a  in the production of some Boeing 737 MAX planes There were improperly drilled fastener holes in the aft pressure bulkhead According to CFO Brian West during the  the current problem will impact 75 of the 220 planes in inventory which is 165 planesThe problem certainly exists and one may argue that these problems are hindrances to Boeings future goals However I argue investors to look beyond what is likely a temporary hiccup in my opinionDuring the 2023 Industrial Conference Boeings CFO Mr Brian West gave investors significant insight into the companys views for 2023 and beyondStarting with 2023 despite the ongoing problems with Spirit AeroSystems Mr West has said that Boeing has a range of 400 to 450 for the 737 deliveries goal in 2023 and the company is not changing that range although it is likely for the delivery numbers to be in the lower range of this goal due to the ongoing problem Further the company continued to reiterate 3  5 billion in free cash flow for 2023Thus I believe this show of confidence could be interpreted as the ongoing problems surrounding Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are a nearterm risk that will likely not have a major impact on Boeings 2023 goals let alone the companys longerterm visionFurther despite the ongoing problems with 737 productions the company has reiterated its plans to increase 787 production from 3 per month to 4 per month by the end of 2023 during the Industrial ConferenceOverall I believe the recent drop in Boeing stock is unwarranted It is true that problems surrounding Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are significant and should have never happened But I believe the current problem is temporary and it is unfair for Mr Market to punish Boeing for something that could be overcome in the coming few quartersThe current problem may be temporary but for Boeing to see future growth in both topline and bottomline the company must drastically increase its delivery numbers To address this  737 MAX production from 3138 per month to 50 per month 787 production from 4 to 5 per month to 10 per month and 777 production from 3 per month to 4 per month These goals are expected to take place by 20252026 which is called the master schedule by the companyThe successful execution of the master schedule is critical to Boeing and my bullish thesis as the companys recovery and growth in the top and bottom line depends on this plan Higher production volume impacting revenue is fairly obvious so I will focus on the expected margins as these plans unfoldBoeing is eyeing recovery in 737 and 787 margins to 2018 levels in the coming years Mr West acknowledged that the margins on 737 and 787 today are lower than in 2018 driven by production rates being lower now than they were in 2018 Also the company has two dual factories that weve had to stand up to support the inventoried airplanes on both the 87 and the 37 which were impacting margins However going forward as inventories continue to trickle down and production rates increase these problems could be behind Boeing More concretely Mr West guided for a 737 margin rate in line with 2018 and a 787 margin rate higher than 2018 due to favorable model 10 mixesI believe this argument to be reasonable If no inventories are dragging the company while higher production volume creates lower unit costs it is natural for the companys margins to improve But is it realisticIn my opinion the answer is yes Although there were numerous bumps in progress the company has been consistently showing progress and delivery number increases since 737 MAX rece,38,2023-10-17,0

409,"Microvast: The Management Is Selling, And So Should You",Continuing in my analysis of companies involved in the lithium battery world I have chosen to study Microvast Holdings  this time around This is a small company headquartered in Colorado specializing in designing and producingSince its debut on NASDAQ Microvast shares have lost over 80 of their value In this analysis I aim to answer a question Is this a golden opportunity to buy at a very low valuation or is the downtrend set to continue over the coming yearsIn my opinion its not a good company to invest in as it lacks at least one of the two critical factors to succeed in the long term in the EV battery sector it neither has revolutionary technology nor is it aContrary to what I suggested  where I even proposed a short sell in this case Ill limit myself to saying that there are better companies for our capital For instance I recently revisited  and believe it to be a much more intriguing smallcap within the same sector with huge potential for an asymmetric betAll of Microvasts batteries are designed in Colorado Production takes place in centers located in China Huzhou Europe Berlin and the United States Operations in the USA are split between ESS system assembly in Windsor Colorado and battery production in Clarksville Tennessee The Clarksville center is not yet ready but it is expected to start limited production in Q4 and then become fully operational by 2024Over time Microvast began producing various batteries with its first successful models emerging in 2020 Currently however 80 of the backlog concerns the latest 535 amp model Quoting from the recent In addition to producing battery cells Microvast can also assemble battery modules and packs The battery packs can be customized according to needs in the US they are primarily required for battery storage operations while in Europe demand mainly comes from heavy vehicle manufacturersBelow are the main figures related to Microvasts income statement over the past few years data in  million source Seeking AlphaAs one can see revenues and margins have been on a roller coaster for the past 5 years Depending on market conditions a battery was more or less in demand and a facility could benefit from tax incentives or not 2023 has been another year of very moderate growth so far but a new boom is expected next year as of June 30 2023 Microvasts backlog was 600 higher than that of June 30 2022 standing at 675 million dollarsThe volatility in revenue and margins comes precisely from the product mix At this particular historical moment the 535amp battery has enjoyed great commercial success and Microvast manages to sell it with good margins Almost all of the backlog depends on this single product which like every other battery in the market will face increasing competition in the coming monthsLets now turn to the data on financial solidityAs can be seen the company has essentially used the proceeds from its stock market listing to finance its capital expenditure Most of the funds were used to expand the production facility in Colorado so as to assemble the ESS units there and take advantage of the tax incentives of section 45x of the IRA and to build the new plant in TennesseeHere is a table showing the most relevant valuation multiples for Microvast compared to other battery producers Most of the competitors are in one of two situations they are either smallmicrocap companies in a prerevenue stage or big consolidated manufacturers Since it would be of little value to compare the multiples of prerevenue companies for my comparison I opted for the big manufacturersI could not use the PE ratio since Microvast is still unprofitable Judging by the data I would much rather on Samsung SDI than Microvast Also we should not forget that gross margins for Microvast have been very volatile in the past while Samsung have kept theirs very steady in a 1721 rangeThe EV battery market sha,20,2023-10-18,0
410,First Majestic Silver: A Disappointing Q3,The Q3 Earnings Season for the Silver Miners Index  is just around the corner and one of the first companies to release its preliminary results is First Majestic Silver  And whileFirst Majestic Silver First Majestic released its Q3 production results this week reporting quarterly production of 629 million SEOs made up of 246 million ounces of silver and 46700 ounces of gold This translated to a significant decline from the yearago period with SEO production down 28 yearoveryear In fairness the bulk of the decline was because of lapping production from Jerritt Canyon in the yearago period which has since moved into care  maintenance However while the company can get a pass from a comparison standpoint it wasnt forced to make the Jerritt Canyon acquisition and its certainly put a severe dent in its per share metrics given the dilution related to the deal 267 million sharesDigging into the results a little closer much of this decline came from the companys lower cost San Dimas Mine which doesnt paint a splendid picture for Q3 margins especially when combined with the Mexican Peso which continued to trend higher for most of Q3 vs the US Dollar  and averaged its lowest price in years at 171 MXNUSD vs 177 in Q2 2023 The lower production at San Dimas resulted from much lower grades with silver and gold grades slipping to 237 grams per tonne of silver and 271 grams per tonne of gold respectively down from 289 grams per tonne and 41 grams per tonne in the yearago period And while increased throughput offset this 213700 tonnes I would expect much higher costs yearoveryear at San Dimas with the asset up against tough comps relying on higher tonnes to maintain the 30 million ounce production level Q2 2022 378 million SEOs and higher labor costsFortunately the companys 2 Santa Elena Mine had a solid quarter benefiting from increased grades and throughput plus a boost to gold recoveries which improved from 92 Q3 2022 and 94 Q2 2023 to 95 with the commissioning of its dualcircuit plant a 300 basis point improvement The result of the higher gold grades was that the mine saw a 13 increase in silver production and 6 increase in gold production despite being up against difficult comps in the yearago period from the start of production at Ermitano That said while the mine will benefit from slightly higher production I would still expect this to be a relatively highcost quarter given the sticky inflationary pressuresFinally at the companys smallest La Encantada Mine there wasnt much to write home about here either This is because the mine saw a 27 decline in silver production to 566000 ounces down from 779000 ounces in the yearago period First Majestic noted that the lower production was related to the collapse of one well which affected water availability and that production would normalize once construction of the replacement well is complete which began in September On a positive note First Majestic is still on track to meet downward revised guidance despite the weaker Q3 results yearoveryear tracking at 75 of its guidance midpoint of 262 to 278 million SEOSAs for recent developments the weakness in the silver price certainly doesnt help the outlook for Q4 especially when the companys costs are likely to remain elevated yearoveryear despite turning off its highestcost operation Jerritt Canyon This is because while the Mexican Peso has finally given up some ground vs the US Dollar after a near parabolic rally from December 2022 through August 2023 its still sitting at 10 higher levels yearoveryear Meanwhile the outlook for profitsharing and wages has arguably worsened with Newmont  caving in to an 8 raise for the National Union of Mine Metal and Allied Workers of the Mexican Republic earlier this month And while this doesnt mean that wages must go up for other mines it certainly isnt an ideal,10,2023-10-13,0

417,EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc  is a closedend fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations master limited partnerships and other energy infrastructure companies This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most incomefocused investorsAs regular readers will likely recall we last discussed this fund in midSeptember although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17 2023 That was well before energy prices started to tick up in midJuly so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests We can actually see this by looking at the funds performance which has been substantially better than the broader SP 500 Index  since that article was publishedThe difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the SP 500 Index which provides a boost to its overall investment return When we consider this distribution investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 1226 over the past five months compared to 360 for investors in the SP 500 Index That is a pretty significant difference in results Fortunately there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward although perhaps not quite that strongThere have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article Most importantly the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss Therefore let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an incomefocused portfolio todayAccording to the funds  the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return This makes sense because this is a common equity fund which is immediately apparent in the fact that 9806 of the funds assets are invested in common equityAs I have pointed out in numerous previous articles common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle After all investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of timeIn the case of midstream companies and partnerships a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index  which primarily tracks midstream partnerships Here are the comparison figures for the past yearAs we can see the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 1193 but investors in the fund actually realized a 2131 gain on their investment This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments In many years the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this As such we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciationAs regular readers are no doubt well aware I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site As such most re,5,2023-10-10,0
418,Vital Farms: This Stock Is Cooking (Rating Upgrade),Almost exactly 11 months ago I found myself analyzing a rather interesting company in the food space Generally speaking I dont like to play much in this market because it is highly competitive and margins can beWhile this may not seem like a strong growth area the company has achievedRecent financial performance achieved by Vital Farms has been truly impressive Take revenue during the  During that time revenue totaled 2256 million Thats 411 higher than the 1599 million the company generated the same time one year earlier Higher volume contributed 252 million to the companys growth during that time with both new and existing customers proving to be beneficial for the company It is worth noting however that most of the growth about 405 million can be attributed to If this seems outrageous keep in mind that as shown in the chart above the US did experience a rather significant surge in the price of eggs with those prices peaking earlier this year Weak production levels were driven by not only supply chain issues but also more importantly the avian flu In January of 2019 for instance there were an  3418 million egg laying hens across the nation That number declined over the next three years and by January of 2022 the size of the flock had dropped to 326 million It is interesting to note that a shift in consumer focus toward promoting cage free hens over caged ones did result in an increase in the number of cage free layers during this window of timeWhile revenue for the company increased nicely profits followed suit The firm went from generating a net loss of 13 million in the first half of 2022 to generating a net profit of 138 million the same time of 2023 Other profitability metrics increased as well Operating cash flow for instance went from negative 3 million to 189 million Adjusted operating cash flow which adjusts for changes in working capital jumped from 31 million to 25 million And finally EBITDA for the company expanded from 42 million to 252 millionFor the current fiscal year management is quite optimistic This may seem peculiar to some given that egg prices have fallen significantly since peaking Driven by higher volume that management chalked up to continued investments in its physical footprint the firm came out with guidance when it reported second quarter results indicating that revenue this year should be in excess of 465 million Thats significantly above the 3621 million generated in 2022 Meanwhile EBITDA for the company should be greater than 35 million Thats more than double the 162 million generated one year earlier A rough estimate from that would indicate adjusted operating cash flow for the year of roughly 348 millionGiven these figures I was able to value the company as shown in the chart above On a forward basis the firm is trading at a price to adjusted operating cash flow multiple of 13 This is down nicely from the 281 reading that we get using data from 2022 Over the same window of time the EV to EBITDA multiple looks to be dropping from 226 to 105 This takes the company from very expensive to very affordable very quicklyI can understand why some investors might be hesitant This is especially true after seeing egg prices drop like they have But managements not banking on egg prices remaining elevated Rather they are putting all of their eggs in the growth basket You see by the end of 2027 the company  to be generating annualized revenue in excess of 1 billion Thats approximately triple what was generated last year A lot of this growth will come from the companys existing Egg Central Station At full capacity its capable of producing 6 million eggs per day which should based on managements estimates result in over 700 million of net revenue each year Other investments will make up the rest of that gap And because the company has virtually no debt and it enjoys cash and cash equiva,8,2023-10-28,0

425,Evolution Petroleum Is Going Conventional,  is a small company that has been very conservatively managed for as long as I can remember A no debt  has been a priority until a spate of acquisitions disappointed the market But the company listed weatherrelated and maintenancerelated issues that are part of the business Nothing listed in the earnings report accounts for the market reactionInstead the market should have concentrated on the rather generous dividend that is supported by an extremely strong balance sheet That 12 per share  provides a yield that most investors report on average for a full year return on investmentsEven in a disappointing quarter like the current one cash flow more than supports the dividend Note that accounts payable changes soaked up a lot of cash flow That is a timing issue rather than a permanent cash flow decline It does not as a rule represent a lessening ability to support that dividendBut this little operator has 11 million of cash and basically no longterm debt Not only does the dividend support the stock price longterm but the debt free balance sheet gives management considerable flexibility in the future to go after bargains as it has in the pastThe paydown of liabilities used about 7 million of cash flow in the current quarter That kind of thing will happen with small companies Even with that event which is likely a timing issue the company still reported a decent cash balanceFurthermore the cash flow reported for the fiscal year was a generous approximately 50 million This shows that the diversification program begun a few years ago is successful in lessening the dependence on the Denbury  joint venture Investors have to keep in mind that a small company like this will have lumpy cash flow because expenditures can be rather large for the small company going to be acquired by Exxon Mobil  the immediate future is filled with far more reliability than the Denbury bankruptcy was Exxon Mobil is a renowned operator with a far better reputation than Denbury ever had as a small operator let alone a small one that went bankrupt As management has noted several times Denbury was clearly cash constrained That will not be the case for Exxon MobilProbably the main danger of the Exxon Mobil acquisition is that this joint venture is considered a highcost secondary recovery operation Exxon Mobil is likely to review it for cost improvements and if none are available Exxon Mobil management has a long history of selling interests in highcost operators and reinvesting the cash in lowcost operations So this main source of a decent amount of cash flow may be facing a period of uncertaintyMuch of the conventional assumption is that Exxon Mobil wants the carbon dioxide business of Denbury Therefore that same thought process assumes the secondary recovery business will be sold at some point due to the high costs of the businessEvolution management announced a joint venture with Pedevco This is a conventional opportunity similar to the business run by Ring Energy  This will take the Evolution Petroleum management further into more traditional upstream business while continuing to diversify away from higher cost secondary recovery businessPedevco is a conservatively run company that was hurt badly by the events of fiscal year 2020 The reason was that the company had not finished transitioning to an operating mode from a concept company that was acquiring leases with the idea of developing them This is similar to the Ring Energy story I have covered many times except Ring Energy had more production going into fiscal year 2020That still did not stop fiscal year 2020 from setting a lot of companies back The market changed overnight from relatively friendly to demanding return of capital while becoming very hostile to production growth Since both companies Pedevco and Evolution are financially strong the change in the debt market requirements did not affect either that muchOn the other,63,2023-09-14,0
426,MP Materials: Approaching My Buy Zone,MP Materials  is a company that has gathered a lot of attention as being perhaps the best way to get exposure to rare earth minerals mining in North America Its a marketThe share price for MP has been a wild ride as it reached the top back in April of 2022 reaching almost above 60 It has since come down a fair bit as the market realized the prospects of earnings were perhaps overstated in the previous valuation Production volumes for MP haveMP is a leading producer of rare earth materials within the Western Hemisphere and certainly in North America The company operates in and management of the Mountain Pass Rare Earth mine and its stateoftheart processing facility both strategically situated in North America Additionally MP possesses exclusive mineral rights extending not only to the Mountain Pass mine but also encompassing the vast surrounding regions This comprehensive control over rare earth resources underscores the companys pivotal role in supplying these critical materials to various industriesOne of the driving factors of growth has been significant EV production rampups in the last few years A lot of the required materials and minerals used in the making of those vehicles are things that MP mines and supplies This has created a unique environment where MP is viewed as a strong opportunity for securing rare earth deposit supplies in North America and taking some global market share from ChinaThe US is a significant  for EV cars but so is China and getting rid of some of the reliance on that region is a key priority for them and MP can help do so I think that MP will continue to see strong demand in the coming years but perhaps from an investment point of view MP doesnt look as appealing yet as the pe remains to be quite high I think We have to keep in mind that mining companies often get a lower multiple given the volatility and uncertainty about the material sales prices they can receive With MP trading at an FWD pe of over 60 I think we can rule out a buy right nowLooking beyond that though it looks more appealing if the  can come true If MP can execute its growth initiatives and the prices improve over the next few years then perhaps an EPS of 278 in 2026 is possible If the price remains the same the pe would be under 8 and to me indicate an upside potential of 51 given a 12x earnings multiple That is a potential realized return of 127 in that time For me I think I would want to look for some more improvements in the market conditions before going in or a better potential return as well somewhere closer to an annual return of 15 That might sound high but I think there are some inherent risks associated with commoditydriven companies that need to be baked into the valuationFrom the last  I think it has become clear the MP can consistently ramp up the production levels but perhaps not as able to raise the EPS as fast MP is still at the mercy of the market and the demand for rare earth minerals that it mines for As we can see above the realized prices for MP have been in a steady decline since last year I think this comes as the war in Ukraine shocked a lot of the commodity markets and caused some prices to skyrocket including the material that MP sells I think that we will likely enter a period where prices stabilize somewhat though and MP could start seeing a further uptrend in the coming yearsLooking at the financial  of the company I think its fair to say that MP has had a tough time given the softer pricing environment For the coming quarters I think we need to see an improvement in the pricing environment before a potential buy could be issuedA significant concern I have regarding MP Materials is the persistently negative cash flows This ongoing cash flow issue has resulted in share dilution over time which has compounded the challenges for investors especially considering the stocks decline from its previous highs of nearly 60 per share Its re,43,2023-09-20,0
427,CVR Partners: Likely A Yield Trap,Over the last two years Ive seen a lot of companies that look cheap due to higher commodity prices and higher prices on correlated services such as shipping but end up being value traps as the supply chain issues present in 2022I think the opportunity with CVR Partners is that the yield is substantially reduced when fertilizer prices go down which causes purely distributionfocused investors to sell out This could longer term lead to a deepvalue investing opportunity for investors who arent just buying as a pure yield playThe biggest impact on CVR Partners is the macro environment and more specifically nitrogen fertilizer prices Nitrogen fertilizer prices went up in 2021 due to high inflation higher energy prices higher demand and years of underinvestment in the commodity complex Then in 2022 prices skyrocketed even further due to the Ukraine War In the process the unit price for CVR Partners went up 22x from its 2020 lows Over the last year fertilizer prices have retreated and this showed up in the most recent quarterly earnings when operating income was down 40 over the prior quarter While this is very bearish and the price is down due to this weak earnings report I dont think the market has priced in how low fertilizer prices could truly get and how much that would impact CVR Partners Below are fertilizer pricesUrea is what primarily impacts the revenues of CVR Partners so that is where most of the emphasis should be put when doing analysis in my view Its down from its high but is still nowhere close to where it was in 2021 When it comes to forecasting future fertilizer prices the trouble is that the fertilizer market doesnt have many liquid futures markets and unlike wellfollowed commodities like agricultural commodities there are few institutional analysts covering this space So directly looking at inventories and demand for fertilizers is tough Instead I like to look at the main input into producing fertilizers which are natural gas and the energy complex as energy prices go up it cost more to produce fertilizers so supply goes down and vice versa Below is a chart of fertilizer prices and their correlation to both corn and natural gas pricesAs can be seen ammonia fertilizer prices are highly correlated to both natural gas and corn prices This is because natural gas is a cost input and the agricultural industry creates demand for fertilizers I want to start by looking at natural gas prices and where they are headed The biggest trade in the natural gas markets since the Ukraine War was the arbitrage trade between European natural gas and American natural gas American natural gas stayed cheap as the US producers are producing all the natural gas that the US economy needs while natural gas in Europe went up due to the sanctioning of Russian imports Below is the price of natural gas on Dutch frontmonth Natgas FuturesBelow is the spot price for natural gas with the Henry Hub settlementWhile both Americansettled natural gas and Europeansettled natural gas contracts went up in 2021 and 2022 American natural gas didnt go up anywhere close to the amount that European natural gas did This created an arbitrage opportunity where natural gas in the US could be sent to Europe and the spread could be pocketed Unlike oil natural gas is very hard to transport the only way to get natural gas from the US to Europe is by turning it into LNG and then transporting it from an LNG terminal In this process there were also many hiccups such as the Freeport LNG terminal one of the largest in the world being shut down for two months due to a fireBecause this process is difficult the spread between American and European natural gas has taken a long time to get closer to converging But now European natural gas prices have started to get to the point where it wont be as economical to import natural gas there from the US Once this happens then the demand for American natural gas will ,89,2023-08-04,0

432,USO: The Next Oil Bull Market May Have Begun,The oil market has been stuck in a relatively tight range over the past ten months The range began when I last covered the crude oil futures ETF  with a bullish longterm outlook due to the impending Since the end of June oil prices have risen sharply from 70 to over 80 per barrel causing a 20 rally for USO The rally slowed over the past three weeks as oil returned to its resistance level of 83 That said if oil breaks its pattern of falling back to 70 it would indicateIndeed that may be a reasonable outlook as oils fundamentals have turned potentially bullish If it were not for negative economic perspectives oil may be much more expensive since storage levels are low and are generally still falling However oil prices are depressed because many expect economic demand for gasoline and other oil products to decline over the next twelve months Even if the recession concerns prove correct which I believe I suspect the market is  due to recession concerns Further the oil prices are low due to depressed demand outlooks many oil producers are rapidly reducing drilling levels since oil is near or below the breakeven cost for drilling new wells in certain regionsThus oil production may fall faster than demand A potentially significant oil rally may occur due to another shortage Given much lower storage and specifically SPR inventories there is almost nothing the US government could do to stop a shortage if it returns Given  and US producers will likely cut production should the oil ever fall below 70 USO may be a great opportunity today due to its downside protection and potentially significant upsideUS oil production levels are currently the highest since COVID19 first struck the market Total US continental production spiked significantly over recent weeks likely due to efforts by companies to push products out before hurricane season ramps up and inevitably creates supply issues Thus realistically oil production remains stagnant today as it has throughout 2023 given the recent spike has come before seasonal disruptions begin However future production levels are likely to start to decline as indicated by the falling US and global rig count levels See belowSince most oil wells experience significant production declines during their first year or two a constant stream of new wells must be drilled to maintain continuous production In most circumstances there is some lag of around six months between changes in the rig count and changes to production besides extreme events such as those in 2020 where wells were forcibly shut down The US and global rig count peaked around the beginning of the year and have been falling at an accelerating pace at least in the US due to lower prices indicating US production levels should begin to wane more significantly over the coming months inventories DUCS are also very low after extremely high 2021 These wells have allowed oil producers to rapidly increase production after COVID lockdowns ended without spending significantly on new capital investments Looking forward because the supply of DUCS is lower a higher rig count should be needed to maintain constant production Of course despite a falling rig count and low drilled but uncompleted well levels the EIA believes oil production will rise in 2023 and  In my opinion the EIA may be biased because it seeks to encourage drilling to aid the governments objective of keeping gas prices low That said the EIA suspects production will continue to rise despite lower rig counts due to increases in perwell output efficiency More due to the ongoing rig count decline Crucially demand for oil services i are less interested in paying for capital upgrades to improve efficiencyAlthough the oil production outlook is essential the broader context of low inventories may be more critical I believe it is most likely that US oil production levels wane over the coming six months and potentially ,13,2023-08-28,0
433,ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,Energy MLP stocks were a bright spot in a challenging third quarter for equity markets with the Alerian MLP Index returning 989 as the SP 500 Index   declined 327 Supply cuts from OPEC combined with lower US inventories pushed oil prices higher fueling further inflation and interest rate concerns  a headwind for broad equities but a positive for energy stocksThe dynamics affecting the MLP market remain unchanged Global economies continue to face multiple headwinds led by a combination of stubbornly high though recently moderating inflation elevated geopolitical uncertainty and lingering supply chain and policy impacts from the COVID19 pandemic In the US we have begun to see the dampening effects on the economy of tighter monetary conditions During 2022 equity markets began pricing in a reasonable chance of recession both in the US and abroad Thus far in 2023 global equity markets have recovered most of the losses incurred during 2022 and expectations are increasing that developed economies might avert a severe recessionCrude oil prices fell from more than 120 per barrel in June 2022 to 70 per barrel to end June 2023 Recession fears left oil market traders fearful of global demand downdrafts for crude oil in 2023 much like those witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis GC A stronger US dollar and largescale releases of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR further pressured oil prices On the other hand demand fear was partially offset by some optimism for a rebound in China consumption with the lifting of COVID19 restrictions The surprise OPEC supply cut of 11 million barrels per day at the end of March also likely puts a floor on oil prices over the near term With better visibility on global demand impacts from rising interest rates oil prices steadied and rose in July August and SeptemberEssentially all of this oil demand growth is expected in developing nations rather than OECD nations We would argue that oil prices of roughly 70 per barrel at the end of June discounted that oil demand growth will not approach levels expected by oil economists in 2023 and 2024 Said differently oil traders seem to expect a material contraction in global oil demand growth rates compared to oil economists A final twist to oil demand analysis remains the timing of the US refilling its vastly depleted SPR After drawing down the SPR by roughly 275 million barrels or 45 in the previous 18 months the US government announced in June initial plans to begin refilling the SPR beginning in September Thus what has been a meaningful source of supply in the crude oil markets will become a source of demand looking forwardIf global oil demand growth does approach roughly 2 million barrels per day in 2023 and another 1015 million barrels per day in 2024 we see upside in oil prices over the balance of 2023 and into 2024 The supply side of the global oil market will meaningfully struggle to meet that kind of demand growth We would also argue that the incremental barrel of oil supply in such a scenario will almost have to be a barrel of US oil  continuing to drive visibility in US oil production growth to the benefit of US midstream companiesLooking at natural gas the shortterm outlook is decidedly negative while the intermediate to longterm outlook remains robust An almost complete lack of typical weather last winter left natural gas storage levels 32 higher at the end of March 2023 than a year before Higher storage levels entering the spring and summer also equates to lower natural gas demand to refill storage levels As a result US natural gas prices fell from above 5 per mmbtu at the end of March 2022 to 2 per mmbtu at the end of March 2023 In our view pricing for US natural gas will not meaningfully recover until the beginning of winter with an effective reset on storage levelsWith continued organic domestic demand growth and inc,2,2023-10-22,0

435,First Solar: Growing Capacity And A Growing Backlog Equals Growth,First solar  was founded in 1990 and was incorporated in 1999 In 2002 they finished their first commercial production facility in Perrysburg Ohio with the capacity to create 15 megawatts per year Today First Solar is the largest producer of solar panels inFirst Solar will be building their  for a cost of 11 billion located in Louisiana Funding for this new facility is partly due to the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in August 2022 It is expected to come online in 2026 bringing 35 more gigawatts of manufacturing capacity per year adding to its existing 115 GW Just this year alone the company has made plans to spend an additional 17 billion at a new site in Alabama and by expanding a facility in OhioAt current production levels and with no new orders the company has a backlog that will last until at least 2030 The slide below shows their backlog at different dates in the blue bars And the green demonstrates how their backlog is growing throughout 2023 In other words their order backlog is outpacing their ability to produce solar panels This is an encouraging sign for investorsThe following slide demonstrates the total opportunities that are available in the solar industry for First Solar to go out and get This demonstrates that even though they have a backlog that will last until 2030 the potential to extend that backlog is also thereCurrently the subsidies that individuals can receive for installing  are up to 30 of the cost of the panels according to some sources This is set to continue from 2023 all the way until 2032 This provides some strong visibility into the future demand for solar panelsIn addition First Solar was able to begin building a fifth plant using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act And so we can see that the solar industry is subsidized on the capital funding side as well as on the demand sideI am not going to evaluate what percentage of First Solars profit is dependent on subsidies in this article but it is important to know that a certain percentage of both First Solars demand and their capital investments are subsidizedI rarely like to invest in a business that requires subsidies from the US government or any government however many people have become fabulously wealthy by investing into government tax breaks whether that be local or federal tax breaks And so while I might shy away from companies like this others might see this as an opportunityGoing forward the question I will be interested in is what will the economics of solar panels be when the subsidies run out in 2032 Will they be able to produce panels economically enough for subsidies to not be necessary I dont know the answer but I think that based on First Solars backlog they will have plenty of opportunities to find ways to make the panels more economical and with the full force of the climatechange narrative and the government funding backing the industry I wouldnt expect First Solars backlog to experience any kind of decline So I would love nothing more than for the solar industry to be able to create energy that no longer requires subsidies Time will tellAs of this writing First Solar has a 20 billion market capitalization So is this cheap or is this expensive relative to the performance of their current business Lets measure this relative to operating cash flowHere are the cash flows from operations for the past four years With a 20 billion market cap I believe First Solar is a little overvalued relative to these cash flows I wont discuss their balance sheet in this article but First Solar also has a strong balance sheet The question is will First Solars cash flows grow dramatically over the coming years They certainly have potential growth catalysts in that they are expanding their manufacturing facilities For arguments sake lets extrapolate that in 2024 First Solar will have Cash Flows From Operations of 1 Billion Even then at todays prices,44,2023-09-01,0
436,Amplify Energy: A Long-Term Winner On Valuation And Quality Assets,Investing into oil and gas might not be exactly what has been hyped over the last few years as many renewable and solar companies saw their valuations skyrocket But when the prices for those increased and ultimatelyThe company is included in the oil and gas exploration and production industry where it primarily focuses on engaging in both acquisitions and developments of oil and natural gas in the United States The need for these resources is unlikely to diminish anytime soon and I think there isOne of the major benefits of AMPY right now is the solid asset base they have consisting of solid and lowdecline projects across the USThe are diversified and span across Texas and some parts of California too The assets are longlasting reserves and are likely to continue yielding AMPY solid returns over the coming several decadesOne of the major benefits of having such assets is the consistent cash flows they can generate from them The 5year  of FCF margins for AMPY is a very strong 25 which is far above the sector average of 623 I think this should equate to a higher premium for the company and a pFCF of around 6  7 should be applied for sure With sector beating margins a premium is valid and the proven stability of it as well further adds to that argument That would put a price target of around 14  16 for the company indicating a significant upside from current pricesWhile its a common perspective to view the future of oil and gas through a negative lens due to the ascendance of renewables the narrative is more nuanced than a simple relegation of traditional energy sources The landscape of energy generation is indeed transforming with renewables gaining prominence and advocating for a cleaner and more sustainable futureEven as ambitious emission targets are set for  the practicality of completely eradicating oil and gas from the energy mix is complex These resources continue to offer a reliable and accessible energy source particularly in regions where alternative options are still developing Furthermore the extensive investment in oil and gas infrastructure including refineries pipelines and distribution networks underscores their role as integral components of our energy ecosystem Despite the above having data until 2021 I think it quite clearly showcases the dependence the US has on both oil and gas to generate energy to support the massive grid they have This is unlikely to shift in the short term and makes investments into AMPY still very appealingLooking at the from the last quarter we can see that AMPY had some decent results actually as production levels were up around 9 on a YoY basis Net cash generated during the quarter was 49 million and EPS came in at 024 a massive beat from the expected 013 for the quarter This hasnt translated into a higher share price as AMPY posted strong results Instead the share price has remained in the same range and that leaves us with a solid opportunity still to capitalize and invest accordinglyOn a QoQ basis the FCF was down a fair bit to 61 million but AMPY still has performed quite well maintaining solid margins The company also reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 and the CEO briefly mentioned that some of the challenges placed on the company in the last 2 years are residing and more positive times seem to lie ahead I think for upcoming quarters the most important factor to look out for will be an increase in the production levels of the company this would indicate a more positive and demand market condition for AMPY which with solid operation performances will raise margins and the share price as wellWhile the company has subtly alluded to the possibility of divestitures its intriguing to consider the alternative scenario where they veer in the opposite direction Given the companys existing low leverage a strategic shift towards initiating acquisitions could potentially trigger a downward trajectory in the stocks trading per,16,2023-08-23,0

441,Newmont: Sitting At Trough Multiple Ahead Of Margin Recovery,The Q2 Earnings Season wasnt nearly as strong as expected for the gold sector and Newmonts  headline results were among the weakest sectorwide with lower production higher costs and a significant decline in free cash flow However this isIn this update well look at Newcrests annual results and why this deal will be transformative for Newmont especially when combined with the improving free cash flow generation for its legacy businessNewcrest released its FY2023 June 2022 to June 2023 results last month reporting annual production of 211 million ounces of gold and 133100 tonnes of copper an increase from 196 million ounces of gold and 120700 tonnes of copper in the yearago period The higher production was related to a stronger year at Cadia and a full year of gold production from Brucejack offset by lower production at Telfer Lihir and Red Chris And despite minimal help from gold and copper prices flat and down respectively Newcrest had a solid year financially reporting revenue of 451 billion operating cash flow of 161 billion and industryleading allin sustaining costs of 1093oz up 5 yearoveryear which was a much smaller rate of change than its peer groupDigging into the results a little closer Cadia was the standout with 596900 ounces of gold produced at allin sustaining costs AISC of 45oz making this one of the lowestcost mines sectorwide next to Ernest Henry This solid cost performance was despite higher sustaining capital in the period related to TSF construction and it was despite a lower average realized copper price of 376lb resulting in lower byproduct credits Newcrest noted that the improved production was related to recovery improvements following the commissioning of the twostage plant expansion project and the company also approved the Cadia PC12 Feasibility Study with first ore expected in FY2026 While costly at 12 billion the project has a 23 IRR at 1950oz gold and extends the mine life well into the 2050s making this one of the longestlife gold assets sectorwideUnfortunately the solid results at Cadia were overshadowed by a tough year the companys largest Lihir Mine in Papua New Guinea which produced just 670000 ounces last year down from 687000 ounces in FY2022 The lower production was related to lower feed grades with a higher proportion of lowgrade expit material processed in H2 due to the impact of extreme rainfall which impeded pit access and affected material handling at the crushers This softer H2 production was on top of an already tough H1 performance where mill throughput was impacted by drought conditions which limited water supply in addition to lower mill availability due to unplanned downtime Fortunately 2024 will be a better year with highgrade ore from the recently approved Phase 14A cutback and this will help to displace lowergrade stockpiles previously planned for feed during the transitional zone between the Lienits and Kapit Pit from FY2023 to FY2027The result is a more consistent production profile with higher output overall with a steady trend higher in gold production going forward until FY2030 And like Cadia returns are robust with a 64 IRR even at a conservative 1800oz gold price assumptionFinally in British Columbia production was lower at the companys new Brucejack Mine but costs still came in well below the industry average Looking at the annual results Brucejack produced 286000 ounces of gold at allin sustaining costs of 1157oz despite a 60 increase in sustaining capital in the period Meanwhile the mine generated 115 million in free cash flow despite lower production than planned Unfortunately Red Chris results were weaker with lower gold and copper production a lower copper price and similar sustaining capital contributing to costs well above the industry average 3733oz vs 1349oz Newcrest noted that recoveries were impacted by a s,81,2023-09-12,0
442,Harley-Davidson Appears To Be A Value Trap,Shares of HarleyDavidson  have been a poor performer over the past year losing 16 of their value continuing what has been a long period of poor performance Shares have lost over half of their value in theOver the past  Harleys revenue has fallen by about 2 while operating income is about 18 lower than a decade ago As prices have risen over the past decade volumes have been steadily declining and given rising wagesIf we begin by looking at the companys  results it earned 122 down 16 from last year as total revenue fell by 2 to 145 billion Motorcycle revenue fell by 4 partially offset by a rise in financing revenue Motorcycle operating income fell by 8 to 194 million as margins contracted 60bp to 162In Q2 volumes were down 10 and prices up 4 which was not enough to offset rising labor costs Notably gross margins for bikes rose by 390bp to 348 as commodity input cost pressures have abated but this was offset by higher operating expensesIt is important to note that HOG generates revenue by making and selling motorcycles to sell to its dealers When the dealer buys the product HOG books the revenue not when the dealer goes on to sell it to a customer During the quarter Harley had unplanned production outages which is a major reason its volumes declined  this is the second year in a row the company faced production issues which does open questions about quality control of its operationsWhile this outage led to the drop in deliveries to dealer blamed for the revenue decline I am not certain HOG really underdelivered relative to end customer demand Now retail sales were up 3 in Q2  seven percentage points better than Harleys revenue This sales growth and retail outperformance is a good thing to see unquestionably That said inventories at Harleys dealers have been rising and are probably now at an appropriate level even after this retail sales outperformance Harley dealers are currently carrying 52000 unitsThis is up dramatically from 2022 inventory of 27000 Now like automobiles motorcycle supply chains were significantly stressed during COVID leading to production problems and product shortages That 27k level was too low I am not certain 52k is though Admittedly dealers were carrying 73000 units in 2019 Looking at that metric Harley could further increase deliveries to dealers providing further revenue opportunitiesHowever when there is too much inventory for demand pricing concessions can become necessary in order to move products to create space for newer models This was a challenge HOG faced during the 2010s as sales were falling Pricing is the best way to measure inventory levels relative to demand if prices are rising substantially inventories are likely too low Well prices rose just 4 over the past year broadly in line with  That does not appear to point to a lack of inventory aims for its bikes to sell within 2 of MSRP manufacturers suggested retail price when dealers are selling above MSRP that points to them holding too little inventory but when prices fall below MSRP that can cheapen the brand make customers trained to wait for promotions and points to too much inventory Last quarter HOG was seeing transactions occurring in this 2 band This makes me skeptical that HOG will be able to meaningfully catch up on revenue and volumes lost during its shortage because its dealers appear not to really need that much more inventory than they currently carry Higher rates and inflation have also caused affordability and demand challenges according to management so this is unlikely to change in coming quarters This means deliveries should largely be consistent with consumer demand trendsPost COVID Harley has been able to regain some margin by reversing its history of overstocking dealers with inventory It will be important for them to retain their discipline Particularly as the company has struggled to grow beyond its existi,4,2023-10-17,0
443,Hess Midstream: An 8.3% Dividend Yield Is A Gift For Value Investors,Hess Midstream  has demonstrated stellar financial performance over the past decade with revenue compounding doubledigits and profitability metrics expanding notably A stellar free cash flow margin lets the company prioritize shareholder returns with a solid dividend payoutHess Midstream is an energy infrastructure company that owns operates develops and acquires diverse midstream assets and provides feebased services to Hess Corporation  and thirdparty customersThe companys fiscal year ends on December 31 HESM conducts business through three operating segments Gathering Processing  Storage PS and Terminaling  Export TE According to the The companys financial performance has been solid over the past decade with revenue compounding at about 19 per annum Profitability metrics are also expanding with the operating margin at a stellar 62 in the latest fiscal year The company has generated a massive free cash flow FCF margin in the last two fiscal yearsHaving strong profitability metrics enables the company to sustain a shareholderfriendly capital allocation approach with consistent dividend payouts and share buybacks On the other hand I cannot say that the balance sheet is strong Financial leverage is substantial and liquidity metrics are lower than one the level which is considered to indicate a solid liquidity positionThe latest quarters earnings were released on July 26 when the company topped consensus estimates on revenue and EPS Revenue grew 34 YoY and the adjusted EPS was flat at 050 Despite revenue growth profitability metrics shrank slightly During the  the management expressed their confidence in the companys nearterm prospects and upgraded fullyear guidanceThe upcoming quarters earnings release is scheduled for October 27 Quarterly revenue is expected by consensus at 345 million indicating slightly below 3 YoY growth The adjusted EPS is expected to be flat at 053I like the dynamic of HESMs financial performance The business demonstrates solid revenue growth and stellar profitability metrics Dividend increases and substantial share buybacks are also suitable for investors I consider the companys approach to financial leverage as risky but the company has a strong track record of success and business expansion with substantial indebtedness in recent years According to the companys latest 10K report HESM has longterm agreements with its affiliate HES with clauses including minimum volume commitments inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms I think all these agreements terms are favorable for HESM and will provide the company with cash flow stability growth and downside risk protection Since HESM is a related party to HES the company does not face competition for the volumes from its sole customer That said to understand HESMs future growth prospects we need to look at what consensus estimates forecasts for the customers revenue for the next decadeAs we see above consensus estimates forecast HESs revenue to double over the next decade I think this assumption is fair given the area where HES operates North Dakota is the USs thirdlargest oil production state after Texas and New Mexico The state also has almost  of US natural gas resources which is massive It is important to emphasize that HES and HESM operate in the relatively young and promising Bakken formation in the Williston Basin As we see from the latest EIAs Bakken region drilling productivity  we see that perrig production volumes continue to grow and there is still room for improvement to prepandemic levels That said I expect volumes for HESM to continue growth in the next several years Given the nature of HESMs favorable terms with HES related to inflation and fee upward adjustments maintaining HESMs productivity capacity becomes the cornerstone for the companys future success As the oil formation itself is still young and expandi,33,2023-08-26,0

445,Black Stone Minerals: Preferred Unit Distribution May Be Adjusted Above 10%,Black Stone Minerals  primarily produces natural gas and is also partially hedged for 2024 but it should still benefit a bit from improved oil prices I now project Black Stones 2024 distributable cash flow at 181 per unit that Black Stone can maintain its current common unit distribution which is 0475 per quarter or 190 per year However its preferred units may now see their distribution rate adjusted to 10 in November 2023 potentially leading Black Stone to work on at least a partial redemption of those units in late 2025 to early 2026 This is something to keep an eye on in the futureBlack Stone has 14711219 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units outstanding with a par value of 300 million These  have a 7 distribution rate currently resulting in 21 million per year in preferred distributions However the preferred units will see their  on November 28 2023 to the greater of its current distribution rate and the 10year Treasury Rate  55The potential challenge for Black Stone is that the 10year Treasury Rate is currently the highest it has been since 2007 This would result in the preferred units at the current 461 10year Treasury Rate ending up with a 1011 distribution rate leading to 3033 million per year in preferred distributionsWhile the distribution rate gets redetermined every two years the formula calls for the new distribution rate to be the greater of the current distribution rate and the 10year Treasury Rate  55 Thus if the distribution rate changes to 1011 in November 2023 that becomes the new floor for the distribution rate going forwardThe Series B preferred units may be converted by holders into common units on a oneforone basis which results in an effective price of 203926 per unit Black Stones common units are trading around 14 below that price currentlyBlack Stone also has the ability to redeem the Series B units at 105 of par value during a 90day period beginning November 28 2023 It may later redeem the Series B units at 100 of par during a 90day period beginning November 28 2025The interest rate for Black Stones credit facility appears to be around 78 to 88 currently depending on borrowing base utilization Thus it appears to make more sense financially for Black Stone to wait until November 2025 to potentially redeem at least some of its Series B units at par rather than pay a 5 premium in a couple of monthsOil prices have improved a decent amount since I last looked at Black Stone with the 2024 WTI oil strip up approximately 550 to 8250 per barrel This adds approximately 215 million to Black Stones unhedged revenues for 2024The 2024 Henry Hub strip has gone down slightly by 010 per Mcf over that same time frame reducing Black Stones unhedged revenues by approximately 6 millionBlack Stone has around 46 of its 2024 oil production hedged and the value of its 2024 oil hedges has decreased by another 10 million Around 67 of Black Stones 2024 natural gas production has been hedged and those hedges have gained around 4 million in valueI now project Black Stones distributable cash flow at 181 per unit for 2024 resulting in 095x distribution coverage at its current 0475 per unit quarterly distributionThis assumes the production of 38300 BOEPD 72 natural gas in 2024 for Black StoneLooking forward to 2025 it appears that Black Stones distributable cash flow could improve due to higher natural gas prices and a lack of belowmarket value hedgesThe current strip for 2025 is approximately 76 WTI oil and 395 Henry Hub natural gas Black Stone currently does not have any 2025 hedges If Black Stones production remains at 2024 levels the improved natural gas prices in 2025 more than offsets the impact of weaker oil pricesThus at current 2025 strip and flat production growth Black Stone is projected to generate 194 per unit in distributable cash flow in 2025 resulting in 102x distrib,15,2023-09-28,0
446,Sandstorm Gold Royalties: Recent Developments Upgrade Investment Thesis,Just over a month ago    noting that the company continued to be one of the most attractively valued names sectorwide Since then the stock has struggled to make upside progress but has significantly outperformedIn my view this outperformance is akin to a beachball being held underwater with the weight of the sector weighing on the stock with multiple positive developments over the past several months that should have already catapulted the stock back above US600 per share In this update well take a quick look at the recent Q2 results and recent developments which have upgraded the investment thesisSandstorm Gold reported  earlier this month with record revenue of 498 million attributable goldequivalent ounces GEOs of 24500 and 380 million in operating cash flow with exceptional margins of 1744oz The company has reiterated that debt paydown remains its focus though it took advantage of weakness in the quarter to repurchase 28 million shares for approximately 507 per share This solid performance was driven by a large and more diversified portfolio following the acquisition of Nomad and Basecore last year with new contributions from Antamina 1800 GEOs Caserones 1600 GEOs Blyvoor 700 GEOs Bonikro 1500 GEOs We also saw higher production yearoveryear from legacy assets like Fruta del Norte and Aurizona offseting dips in production at assets like Cerro Moro and Chapada which were up against tougher yearoveryear comparisonsIn addition to the larger portfolio and increased diversification shown in the above chart from these new assets that have begun contributing Sandstorm benefited from a record average realized gold price helping to offset a pullback in copper prices and zinc vs the yearago period However while the quarterly results are important and its nice to see margins and revenue trending in the right direction the more important figure to watch for royaltystreaming companies is developments across the portfolio which will ultimately contribute to future production and growth and sustain a royaltystreaming companys portfolio for the next decade or two Fortunately in Sandstorms case its weighted average mine life is much higher with exposure to several largescale assets Antamina Caserones Chapada and its development portfolio offers similar longlife quality with key assets in Robertson Greenstone Platreef and Hod Maden in addition to further out opportunities like MARA Hugo North Extension and potentially LoboMarteLets take a closer look at some recent developments belowBeginning with positive developments there have been several over the past quarter with Equinox  continuing to make progress at Greenstone where Sandstorm holds a gold stream which will pour first  within 12 months Notably the project remains on budget and schedule thanks to help from an allstar team in G Mining Services Elsewhere Blackwater 021 NSR held by Sandstorm on portion of pit has reiterated an H22024 gold pour despite a minor delay due to wildfires as well a positive development if its expected to be a smaller contributor And of course we cant forget SSR Minings option to take a majority stake in Hod Maden which derisked this asset and put it on course for 2027 production with a wellfinanced operator with Turkiye experience set to take over the reins However arguably the biggest news was Glencores  decision to take full ownership of MARA in a 475 million deal in addition to a royalty increasing its ownership from 25 three years when the JV was established to 100The unsung beneficiary of this deal is Sandstorm Gold which has an option from several years ago to convert its 025 NSR royalty at  into a 20 gold stream at ongoing payments equal to 30 of the spot price of gold And with Glencore taking full ownership of  with Newmont  and Pan American  selling out and a 4year construction period this is an asset that now lo,77,2023-08-17,0

452,Marathon Oil Corporation: I Like This Company Very Much,Marathon Oil Corporation  has grown significantly over the last several years and now boasts a market cap of over 16 billion The companys share price is very much tied to the price of both oil andWhat I think sets MRO apart right now is the impressive amount of shareholder value they are trying to pass on In the last quarter alone MRO returned 434 million in total to shareholders This was an increase of 10 from the returns in the first quarter to 2023 I think this underscores very well what you are getting right now with MRO a company that is aiming toMRO is primarily engaged in the production of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas within the United States and the African nation of Equatorial Guinea In a significant move the company acquired Ensign Natural Resources a privately held company with a focus on natural gas operations The deal resulted in MRO taking on a larger amount of debt to fund the deal which right now is at 57 billion The debt maturities are far out though so MRO is staying true to its focus on returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividendsMROs primary operations within the United States are concentrated in the Bakken region of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford region in South Texas Additionally the company has smallerscale operations in the New Mexico section of the Permian Basin and Oklahoma This diversified geographic presence allows Marathon Oil to tap into various energy resources across the country Looking at the guidance for the year MRO sees improvements in the production levels in the US with results expected to reach at or above the annual guidance provided This I think is quite bullish as it tells me MRO is seeing the market as very positive right now and that higher earnings are possible Its important to note as well that oil prices have appreciated quite a lot in value recently and if they remain above 90 I would expect even stronger shareholder returns in Q1 and Q2 FY2024The results from the last I think are very strong MRO has proven itself very capable of growing the top and bottom lines efficiently The adjusted FCF for example was up by 70 sequentially We have gone over before that MRO is a business that aims to maximize shareholder returns Right now the company has an annualized distribution yield of 11 which is incredibly appealing to get a piece of enough that a buy rating is suitable I thinkWhile this may not necessarily be categorized as a risk I would express hope for MRO that they place a higher priority on bolstering their current cash position As it currently stands their cash reserves fall short of the 200 million mark which can be attributed in part to the significant 3 billion of Eagle Ford assets from Ensign Natural Resources Considering that the company has upwards of 2 billion in levered free cash flows over the past year it appears prudent to rebuild this cash cushion Doing so would not only provide a safeguard for times when oil prices might face suppression and margins are lower but would also serve the interests of investors as it could potentially facilitate the distribution of dividendsIt should be said that MRO is quite exposed to the price of oil and natural gas As we have seen oil prices rally in the last few months and reach above  so has the share price for MRO A drop in oil prices will likely result in a drop in the share price for MRO If this is a volatility level that some investors arent comfortable with then perhaps MRO isnt the right choiceLooking at the assets though despite the Eagle Fords significant size and productivity its reserves are comparatively smaller with a greater inclination towards natural gas There exists a possibility that MRO may not fully actualize the expected synergies stemming from its acquisition of Ensign or may have paid a premium for this acquisitionComparing MRO to a similarsized business like EQT Corporation  which al,19,2023-09-22,0
