0,Legendary Investor Says Buy Commodities: Our Top Picks,Legendary investor Jim Rogers  sounded the alarm bells for investors on the dollar and advocated investing in commodities In this article we will explore the key points raised by Jim Rogers share our own thoughts and also share a few of ourJim Rogers based part of his bullish outlook on commodities on the dire state of the United States financial health stating that the nation has become the largest debtor nation in the history of the world The alarming level of US debt has raised questions about the nations economic stability moving forward and Rogers emphasized that no nation in history has amassed such debt without negative consequencesHe pointed to historical cycles noting that no currency hasStill with the US government saddled with debt it is inevitable that eventually the dollar will have to be devalued and ultimately face its demise as the worlds reserve currency This paints a bullish picture for real assets like commodities which tend to hold their value over long periods of time particularly relative to fiat currenciesIn addition to the inevitable demise of the dollar there are other macroeconomic reasons to be bullish on commodities For example Mr Rogers pointed out that many asset classes globally appear to be overvalued Stock markets worldwide are hovering near record highs bond markets are only now just beginning to unwind their massive bubble that formed due to historically low interest rates and real estate markets in numerous countries are showing signs of being in a bubble phase as well Amidst this backdrop of inflated assets commodities  particularly precious metals  stand out as undervalued assets right now As a result Rogers stated that commodities are currently the cheapest asset class he knows with silver and sugar in particular remaining significantly below their historical peak pricesAnother reason to be bullish on commodities ranging from agricultural products to silver to copper to energy is that the demands for these products is expected to soar in the coming years for a variety of reasons yet production of these assets has been  inWhen combined with the rapid economic development taking place globally with the relentless advance of technology and the overall growth of the global population the demand for commodities has never been greater even as its production appears to be laggingBeyond the macroeconomic factors there are also geopolitical catalysts for commodities In times of economic turmoil and geopolitical unrest precious metals like gold and silver tend to outperform traditional stocks With the possibility rising of a significant global conflict involving the worlds largest economies the United States China and Japan as well as possibly other major economies like South Korea Great Britain France and Germany and major commodity suppliers like Russia Iran Saudi Arabia Canada andor Australia the appeal of these safehaven assets could intensify in the coming yearsSuch a conflict  especially if it involved the semiconductor production capital of the world Taiwan  could have farreaching economic implications with estimates suggesting immediate damages of 26 trillion and potential global depression In such a scenario the confidence in the US dollar might erode rendering gold and silver even more attractive as safehaven assetsAdditionally commodity supply chains could be significantly disrupted causing the prices of commodities like food energy and even copper and other industrial metals to soarWith so many potential tailwinds for commodities right now and their valuations in general not appearing to be in any way at bubble levels the riskreward profile for the sector is generally quite attractive With that said how should investors consider gaining exposure to the sectorOne popular approach is through exchangetraded funds or ETFs Some of the most popular ones includeWhile there are a plethora of other commodities ETFs this list should give you a rough idea of what is available for investors who want to take a more passive andor diversified approach to investing in the sectorWhile ETFs can be a good approach and we ourselves invest in some ourselves we prefer investing in individual stocks that pay out attractive dividends whenever possible For this reason we have significant exposure to energy through high yield investment grade midstream infrastructure  stocks like Energy Transfer  and Enterprise Products Partners  among othersWe also have significant exposure to precious metals copper and other base metals by investing in a variety of miners  at various times depending on the current state of markets Some miners we either hold at present or have held in the past include Rio Tinto  Southern Copper Corp  Barrick Gold  and Newmont Corp Finally a great way to gain access to agricultural commodities is through buying either farmland REITs   or through buying shares of major fertilizer companies such as Nutrien By investing in these companies investors can gain attractive leverage to commodities prices since these commodities businesses often see their profits rise and fall at multiples of the change in price of their underlying commodities Moreover they generate cash flow that they return to shareholders resulting in the benefits of steady passive income along with potentially outsized longterm returns as commodity prices possibly soar higher in the years to come  Samuel Smith is Vice President of Leonberg Capital he has a diverse background that includes being

6,Intercontinental Exchange: Better Valuation When Considering Its Data Edge,With aboveaverage profitability growth revision and momentum  Intercontinental Exchange Inc  is also heavily overvalued as shown below in redHowever much of the data used in valuation comes from accounting books as I will elaborate uponICE basically runs exchanges and marketplaces for commodities and financial products by providing the required infrastructure and technology solutions while not forgetting the data that goes with it For this purpose it is structured into three business  Exchanges Fixed Income and DataThe first two as pictured below recorded revenue growth of 9 and 6 respectively during the second quarter of 2023 Q2 financial results while Mortgage Technology regressed by 16 Despite this counterperformance overall revenues of 19 billion constituted an 8 YoY progression while EPS outperformed Q22022 by 14 According to the management this resulted in the  Q2 in the companys historyLooking for the underlying reasons transaction revenues were up by 12 for the Exchanges segment mostly driven by energyrelated sales more specifically in natural gas Additionally rapid progress was made in crude oil  like Brent and WTI with ADV average daily volumes going up by 26 YoY in Q2 Now traders generally follow the price of oil through the WTI or Brent Crude oil futures contracts but  these there is ICE In addition to energy it is also one of the largest operators of derivatives markets where future contracts for all types of underlying assets like currencies and precious metals are tradedFurthermore the company possibly owns the largest networks of exchanges and clearing houses for financial and commodity markets in the US Europe and some other parts of the world and had it not been for weakness in the listing business due to lower MA activity this year by results would have been strongerMoving to Fixed Income and Data Services this segment also includes a basket of facilitation tools for ease of issuance and redemption of bond ETFs Interestingly these include a chat offering ICE Chat that makes use of large language models LLMs but which are proprietary to ICE and are available to selected clients unlike  ChatGPT which is widely available through the public cloud Moreover the ICE Chat platform has benefited from higher demand after the popularization of Generative AI by ChatGPT and this has translated into a  increase in the volume of energyrelated transactionsThe Data Services business also makes use of  in order to offer products like endofday evaluated pricing and liquidity indicators used by bond ETF issuers in order to make realtime decisions ICE makes this feasible by integrating data from hundreds of sourcesTherefore this is a company that has attained a high level of product differentiation not only through networking with different stakeholders in the financial world but also by the way it processes and provisions data Looking across the industry it competes with the Nasdaq and local exchanges in other parts of the world As for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  it focuses more on trading financial instruments  to commodities futures and options including agricultural products for ICE whose leading market indices are used across multiple asset classes covering derivatives credit and OTC securitiesTherefore the Atlantabased company faces competition and operating margins staying in the 495 to 515 range during the last five years show the company has to spend considerably on operations both to make sure that it has the best talents across the financial space and the technology to support its data platforms As a result it is able to rapidly leverage data in all aspects of operations and should be valued accordinglyNow ICE is richly valued based on metrics that originate from the financial statements income balance sheet and cash flow and to factor in the data assets I will use the stock price and book value per share as per the charts belowFirst looking at the stock price it dropped from around 136 to less than 95 in the first half of 2022 during a downside that is even more pronounced than during the Covid market crash This is partly explained by the high level of debt in May 2022 contracted for the  acquisition in a deal valued at over 13 billion given at that time that ICE only had around 638 million in cash and was already highly indebted at above  Even the company divesting its 985 stake in Euroclear a European company providing posttrade securities settlement and custody management services did little to calm the marketNow this acquisition which has recently obtained the goahead of the  represents a milestone for ICE as it not only reinforces its position in the data analytics business but also extends its integrated software capabilities for the mortgage industry However this seems to be ignored by the market as the book value per share in the orange chart above now trends higher than the share price after the May 2022 reversalAt the end of Q2 the ratio of the share price to book value per share was about 27 as per the table below This ratio was 246 at the end of 2022 but above 3 for the period beforeDetailing further the book value is based on accounting data from a companys balance sheet and provides the difference between assets and liabilities at a specific point in time As such it is a more historical measurement of value than the share price which is related to the actual market cap Now a ratio of less than 3 is illogical as the value of the data assets analytics LLMs exchange data are not priced inTo address this discrepancy based on a historical ratio of 3 I have a target share price of 12762 obtained by multiplying the book value per share of 4254 by three This is 1745 above the current share price of 11017 and is below Wall Streets average price target of  but this still constitutes a fair target as it also takes into consideration macroeconomic uncertaintiesThese uncertainties have adversely impacted the Mortgage Technology business whose revenue regressed as mentioned earlier In this case the company has suffered from the unprecedented pace at which interest rates have been hiked by the Federal Reserve since March of 2022 This has in turn propelled borrowing costs higher with the US average 30year fixed rate mortgage now above  resulting in fewer people contracting new loans for purchasing new homesTalking figures the industry has suffered from a 40 fall in origination volumes and this could continue given that during the last FOMC meeting the tone was hawkish or to maintain  rates for longer Therefore in the event that the Federal Reserve raises rates the stock could experience a high degree of volatility given that ICE will now have higher exposure to the mortgage business with the Black Knight acquisitionStill the fact that the  business declined by 16 instead of 40 as for the industry shows some resiliency which the management attributes to recurring revenues making for nearly  of segmental sales and strength in the Encompass loan origination software system with analytical data usage growing at double digits on a yearonyear basisThis again validates the data asset rationale especially for Mortgage Technology which has been able to partially mitigate the adverse impacts of higher rates better than competitors which is helping to win outsourcing business from top banks as they reduce legacy costs by migrating to the ICE Mortgage Technology platformThinking aloud market positioning in the mortgage industry could be enhanced by additional market share gained through the Black Knight acquisition with 125 million of revenue synergies expected by year five of the closing of the deal or 2028 More is expected in terms of cost synergies or 200 million Noteworthily these synergies remain intact despite Black Knights Optimal Blue business being acquired by Constellation for 700 million as part of a regulatory requirementIn conclusion this thesis has shown that ICE is taking advantage of data not only through analytics to be more knowledgeable about its customer base and target them with more appropriate product offerings but also by improving customer interaction through ChatGPTstyle communication tools In addition it is also in the business of selling processed dataThis way of leveraging data deserves higher valuations and I have a target of 127128 but investors should be aware that the markets could be volatile in the coming weeks as there are  of a government shutdown in case funding is not obtained in time while investors are still digesting the higher for longer narrative Thus with its role as a service provider both for lenders and investors in the homeownership space ICEs stock could be impacted  This is an investment thesis and is intended for informational purposes Investors are kindly requested to do additional research before

the equivalent of 110 MMBoe with respect to the Trusts net profits interest MVO Q2 23 10QThe revenues that MVO receives from oil production generally lag production by  1 month 2022 was a big year for MVO with Net Profit Interests NPIs jumping by 125 which in turn resulted in Distributable IncomeUnit also rising by 125 as the unit count remained stable at 1150M unitsThe average price received for

110 MMBoe as of 63023 vs the equivalent of 115 MMBoe received listed as a trigger for terminating the Trust It appears that MVO is much closer to its limit for Net Profit Interests NPIsHowever the curious statement that was listed in its 2022 10K was that the Trust intended to spend 13M in Capex in 20232026MV Partners expects total capital expenditures for the underlying properties during the

supporting a drillbabydrill and frackbabyfrack policy with the administration supporting staying the current course Moderate Republicans like former Governor Haley will continue acknowledging climate

26,"XLE: Crude Oil Goes Boom - Protect Yourself, Buy Energy",On April 20 I wrote an  titled  In that article I made the case to buy energy stocks to be protected from what could become aHeres a part of my takeawaySince then the Energy ETF  has rallied roughly 11 beating the SP 500 by 300 basis pointsNow its time for an update Not only have I written countless articles on various energy stocks updating my bull case but weve also seen a confirmation of my thesisAfter breaking out in July crude oil futures are back at 90 Thats despite poor consumer confidence and a general downtrend in economic growthIn this article Ill discuss the drivers of this bull case and explain why I continue to believe that owning energy stocks is so importantSo lets get to itLike every other commodity oil is all about supply and demandThe supply picture is what worries me meaning it could cause high inflation for many years to come because major basins in the US are running out of steamAfter the Great Financial Crisis US shale production was the reason why global oil prices were subdued most of the time especially after 2014 In 2007 the US produced roughly 500 thousand barrels of oil per day using unconventional measures horizontal drilling Now that number is 8 million barrels per day higherThis annoyed OPEC a lot It even annoyed US producers as they were producing so much that every decline in demand caused oil prices to crashSo many smaller players went bust in the past few yearsNow things are changing US shale is running out of stream Were not seeing peak oil but a significant decline in supply growth Producers are seeing rapidly declining Tier 1 drilling reserves They focus on free cash flow generation instead of production growth and reward investors through dividends and buybacksThey have learned their lesson  especially in an environment where new climate movements want to put big oil out of businessAs the chart above shows shale production is barely higher than it was prior to the pandemic The only basin with growth left is the Permian the big oneEven that basin is expected to reach peak production in 4Q24With the US losing pricing power OPEC is witnessing a chance to become more powerfulOne of the reasons why oil is back at 90 is aggressive output cuts from OPEC mainly Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants to protect 80 Brent at all costs It also seems to be willing to defend 90 Brent given that they announced an extension of the cutsBecause of the supply squeeze were dealing with an increasing supply shortfall pushing up pricesWe can assume that OPEC is likely playing a political game here While Im obviously not a political insider who knows what for example the Saudis are up to I can imagine what they are doing hereLooking at the chart below we see that crude oil storage levels in the US are way below anything weve seen over the past five years and before thatIncluding the strategic reserves reserves are more than 200 million barrels below their longerterm average Also were going into a major election year I doubt Biden  or any Democrat  wants to buy back oil in this environmentHaving said that demand developments are also favorableAs reported by  on September 14 forecasts from leading energy analysts suggest that global crude oil consumption is on an unstoppable ascentThe International Energy Agency IEA projects a recordbreaking 1022 million barrels per day for this year with a relentless climb to 1057 mbd by 2028Exxon Mobil  also anticipates demand to surge by roughly 75 mbd until it peaks in 2040Whats interesting is that the IEA do not confuse this with the EIA isnt that bullish Its outlook includes barely any demand growth through 2028They do not expect 2018 levels to be reached before 2025 as most consumption is expected to come from natural gas liquids and biofuelsAccording to Bloombergs David Fickling we could be looking at a peak demand scenario for crude oil  despite the overall positive demand picture of fossil fuelsHaving said that I agree with the outlook that fossil fuel demand isnt peaking I do not believe that were anywhere close to a peak as were at the start of massive growth in the middleclass population of India and various African nationsWhile India will make sure to build a future with less dependency on foreign energy learning from Chinas mistakes I do not see a scenario where oil demand turns into a headwind  ignoring cyclical recessions that happen occasionally Im talking about the bigger pictureOPEC also issued a  on September 14 reacting to the IEAs outlook and commentsAllow me to share a few quotes from OPECs letter I will add emphasis and my own view on thingsOPEC is 100 right here While suggesting that we could peak demand may very well be a wrong thesis actively pushing for fewer investments in oil and gas is a serious issue Were currently finding out what happens when rising demand meets slower supply growth The middle class and everyone below gets squeezedI often make the case that I am not rooting for high energy inflation Although I have close to 20 energy exposure my main concern is the protection of my portfolio as elevated inflation is generally bad for the stock marketThats also why Im writing this articleLastly I agree with OPEC when it comes to alternativesIve been a number of times on Dubaibased Asharq TV where I discussed energy policies My point has always been to use the proceeds from fossil fuels to build alternatives We should NOT cut reliable sources before we have good alternativesThats the biggest mistake were currently makingPutting all things together Im bullish on oil While I do not rule out potential recession risks that could push oil down 20 to 70 Im a buyer on major weakness protecting my portfolio against what I believe will be a longterm uptrend in crude oil I believe that tripledigit dollar prices are likely which could come with a second wave of inflation  especially if the Fed is forced to cut rates at some pointWhile I do not own XLE I believe that XLE is a great way to hedge against energy inflation without having to take on elevated risksIncepted in 1998 XLE is one of the oldest ETFs on the market It has a 010 expense ratio and a quarterly dividend The current yield is 36 which is mainly driven by Exxon Mobil and Chevron  who account for roughly 40 of this ETFFurthermore as the overview above shows investors get access to refiners as well The ETF also includes providers of energy equipment and servicesThis provides some diversificationDespite not having the benefit of owning tech stocks XLE has outperformed the SP 500 by roughly 450 basis points over the past 12 months This includes dividendsAlthough XLE could be a bumpy ride if we enter a recession I expect XLE to keep outperforming the SP 500 for many more yearsThe energy sector is experiencing a remarkable transformation and the signs point towards a sustained bull market in oil Recent developments such as declining US shale production growth and OPECs strategic output cuts have set the stage for higher oil pricesThe supplydemand dynamics are shifting in favor of oil with supply shortages pushing prices

33,Why Petrobras Is A Great Alternative To Other Oil Majors,Petrobras officially known as    is a 90billion market cap Brazilian oil and gas company with operations both domestically and internationally Petrobras is involved in various aspects of the energy industry including exploration production refining transportation marketing andIt is one of the worlds  oil producers and one of the top 5 exporters of crude oil Petrobras plays a dominant role in the Brazilian energy market  of the countrys oil and gas production The firm is divided into  Exploration and Production Refining Transportation and Marketing and Gas and Power Corporate excluded Petrobras released its Q2 FY2023 financial results and theyIn addition Petrobras achieved a net profit of 58 billion and generated an FCF of 67 billion The companys distribution of dividends totaling 62 billion amid a comfortable OCF of 96 billion underscores PBRs financial strength in my viewOperationally Petrobras reported growth in production especially in the presalt region which now accounts for 78 of their overall production Key projects like the FPSO Almirante Barroso and the acquisition of new exploration blocks highlight their determination to expand production capacity In downstream activities Petrobras showcased its refinery modernization efforts including revamping projects carbon footprint reduction initiatives and technological innovationsOn October 2nd 2023 we found out that Petrobras  by Brazils top environmental agency Ibama to conduct research in the Potiguar basin part of the Equatorial Margin offshore region in Brazils Northeast This comes after months of negotiations and setbacks Petrobras now plans to begin drilling in the area next month to assess the economic viability and extent of oil discoveries made in 2013 at the Pitu well is a promising oil exploration opportunity in Brazil potentially holding reserves similar to those in Guyana where Exxon Mobil  is developing multibillionbarrel discoveries Ibama  Petrobras from drilling in the Foz do Amazonas basin due to environmental concerns leading to this alternative exploration planPetrobras now plans to drill 16 exploratory wells between 20232027 with an estimated investment of 15 billion reais 3 billion dollars in sedimentary basins such as Foz do Amazonas ParáMaranhão Barreirinhas and PotiguarIn addition PBR has other projects that will be put into operation very soonPerhaps the only thing that has kept PBR stock from impressive growth in recent months  besides the falling oil price  is geopolitics But in my opinion the fears surrounding Petrobras related to the election of Brazilian President Lula now appear to be exaggerated Petrobras  nationalized or forced to cut dividends entirely Since Lulas presidency began there has been less aggressive intervention in the companys affairs than many people thought The change in dividend policy reducing the distribution to 45 of FCF as we may see now does not significantly impact Petrobrass dividend attractiveness in my view especially when compared to other international oil and gas majorsIn late September Goldman Sachs analysts slightly improved Brazils real GDP growth expectations proprietary source for FY2023 due to a higherthanexpected Q2 2023 print with a projection of 292 Expectations for FY2024 GDP growth stand at 150 So in general the macro situation in Brazil looks good  it should create a favorable background for the future growth of the Brazilian stock market where PBR should be one of the market leadersOn the global macro front taking into account recent events in Israel another group of Goldman Sachs analysts sees two potential impacts that could affect global oil supplies over time proprietary source paraphrased by the authorThe issue of high oil prices in the world market is a major concern for inflation expectations but not for energy companies like PBR  recent events are clearly bullish for the companyThanks to the still current rumors of a possible nationalization of the company as well as a number of other risks related to the region in which it operates Petrobras is in my opinion one of the most favorable alternatives to Western oil and gas companies such as Exxon or Chevron  PBR currently trades at 22 times next years EVEBITDA 43 less than the peer group averageMoreover Petrobras return on capital employed ROCE and EBITDA margin TTM are significantly better than those of the peer groupOf course my thesis is full of different risks that I may underestimate but you shouldnt Many investors have concerns including neglected cost management unclear pricing policies and potentially unprofitable investments recall the most recent news of more drillings anticipated for the next few years Petrobras is considering offshore wind which is fraught with regulatory and financial uncertainties and critics  that the company should focus on its core activities The new dividend policy could also lead to dividend cuts which are currently priced in and explain the companys cheap valuation levelsHowever taking into account recent events both geopolitical and microeconomic I believe that the PBR stock today has more upside potential than downside risks Of course anything can happen  no one is immune to equity market risk certainly not especially so in an emerging market But when an asset is trading so cheaply and its valuation is based in part on years of fears that still havent been borne out thats food for thought for me personally And unlike Chinese stocks the Brazilian stock market oddly enough seems more understandable to meThats why I rate PBR stock as a Buy this time aroundNow you can get access to the latest and highestquality analysis of recent Wall Street

36,What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,First and foremost the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination This article is not about politics and it will not focus on whats right or wrong Instead we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent as of this writing are up 3 with WTI  trading above 85 and Brent above 87 Initially at the close of Friday WSJ published a report noting that the US is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high Soon after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel If you want to thoroughly review the events Some of you may wonder what does this have to do with oil Historically speaking geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions In this case Israel is not a major oil producer so whats the catch The catch in our view has to do with Irans potential involvement in this whole ordeal WSJ published a piece noting that Irans senior officials helped plan this attack months agoWhile the US has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on IranFor starters we need context to what we are writing In June  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market Since then IEA has confirmed via its figures that Irans oil production is close to 31 million bd Our supply  demand model assumes 33 million bd and official Iranian figures support that production is around 33 million bdPutting all of this together Iran is exporting close to 2 million bd Visible tanker exports account for 15 to 16 million bd while shadow exports account for 400k bdSince H2 2022 the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports As we wrote earlier in the year this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storageWith floating storage gone and crude exports back to 2 million bd 500 to 800k bd below the previous peak whats the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward Perhaps the US does nothing and leaves Iran as is but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view while the risk of a major loss is low we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months We think the average would fall from 2 million bd to 16 million bd In terms of visible tankers this means Irans crude exports would drop closer to 12 million bdWhile it wont be much of a decline it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into yearend and possibly well into H1 2024Looking at our latest supply  demand update we made a few important assumption changesIn essence global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by monthend And if the US starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports then our balance could surprise to the upside But with a deficit of 22 million bd the lack of production decline from Iran wont make that much of a difference eitherOn the other hand with no mega deal on the horizon between Israel and Saudi the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis wont be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least 110bbl With Brent trading at 87 we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a realityIn conclusion global oil inventories should accelerate downward But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession Fund flows will ebb and flow so oil prices wont skyrocket anytime soon Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception Until then we see prices grinding higher with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levelsFor readers looking to add energy stocks Q4 will provide ample opportunities We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil Consolidation and MA are heating up so you will see more and more mergers announced But more importantly always remember that with these oil prices the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist Please be patient fundamentals are on your sideFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are

38,Oil Could Hit $300 A Barrel,It has been a trope that oil is going to become an orphan asset and that its use would end and it would become an obsolete energy source This is because of the gigantic efforts to halt climate change caused by human CO2 emissions TheThe end of oil is not going to happen and the implications are hugeAccording to the IEA the International Energy AgencyChina India and Southeast Asian countries together are expected to account for three out of every four tonnes of coal consumed worldwide in 2023From  Global coal demand set to remain at record levels in 2023The IEA is not some payplay NGO it is a This implication is obvious developing countries are not going to crucify themselves on a cross of sustainability After all these years of accords dramatic predictions plans and  in the developed world  giant shifts in policy developing countries have embraced cheap energy with both hands as a guarantee of their ascendancyIts hard not to slip from being dispassionate about this situation but the magnitude of the facts speak for themselvesAs oil is a less worse source of CO2 than dirty and sometimes very dirty coal oil has no chance of becoming an orphan source of energy As developing countries grow as they will at a dramatic pace so will their thirst for energy With these countries GDP per head only a fraction of their potential their energy needs are also only a fraction of what they will be and these needs will grow in parallel with their economies Fortunately for them  and unfortunately for plans for Net Zero  there is no shortage of coal and likely never will be with enough already found for half a millenniumThis means at the very least business as usual for oil and that likely means 300 a barrelThis idea has proved rather emotive because the thought of oil at these levels brings a realisation of how much gasoline is going to cost at the pump and it sounds like a wild prediction we so often seen on the webTake a look at this chart of historic oil over the last decade or soThe simplest way to look at this chart is to see that for a period of six years 20082014 on a fouryear average oil was at or above 100 a barrelWhen you inflation adjust this for recent years you get thisThe 300 a barrel number comes from taking the 2008 high and adding on the average US energy inflation of the last 60 years You could also add the rolling inflation of the next two or three years on top for good measure but lets not worry about the exact number The time frame is threetofive yearsOnce you have decided fossil fuel consumption is not going down then all you need do is write in the inflation already baked into the world economy to have oil trade much higher than todayInvestors therefore have a simple call to make write oil off or factor into the price the impact of inflation as must be done for any commodity in the long term and then position accordingly For me it is the latter the fact this is not generally understood underlines the potential for investors Futures traders will have no problems trading this with all the fun and games available with highly leveraged contracts but for the more conservative of us sitting on Exxon  or Chevron  or the less highlypriced overseas listed Shell  BP  and Total   all of which I own  is not a difficult theme to buy in on without playing with the risks connected to companies bellow giant statusOnce upon a time the market was trusted to solve problems and when the price of hydrocarbon energy rises above the falling cost of sustainable power then coal and oil will become niche commoditiesI am happy to point out the former and work on the latter and invest accordingly  I own Shell BP and Total Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,868,2023-09-18,6

48,The Saudis Are Dead Serious On Pushing Oil Prices Higher,In the years Ive followed the oil market I have never seen the Saudis this determined to push oil prices up This includes the whatever it takes moment we saw in 2017 when the previous Saudi energy minister Khalid AlFalih started targetingSaudi crude exports for the first 24 days of August are averaging at the lowest level since June 2020 At 53 million bd Saudis will have reduced crude exports by 1 million bd since July Now we dont expect this figure to be final Crude exports for the upcoming week are showing a rebound so final figures could be closer to 56 to 58 million bdBut that doesntThose of you who follow us closely will know that our base case view is for the Saudis to extend the voluntary cut into yearend We explained that its because of the logistical timing issue of when exports hit physical inventories and the impact on market sentiment But with the latest Saudi crude export figure I cant help but wonder if the cut will likely be extended into Q1 of 2024Let me explainHere is IEAs assumption for global oil supply  demand balance into the end of 2024 Out of all of the IEA reports weve read to date the August OMR was the most balanced surprisingNow you will notice that both Q1 and Q2 of 2024 show stockbuilds Keep in mind that the IEA is not assuming the voluntary cut of 1 million bd into its balance in 2024 Instead it is assuming that the Saudis will continue its original 500k bd voluntary cutIn my view the Saudis played this one beautifully By keeping it on a monthtomonth basis it deters speculators from bidding up the long end of the curve and keeps the market at bay The monthtomonth action also prevents speculators from frontrunning prices which prevents any potential risk of demand destruction amidst a weakening global economy Instead the voluntary cut does the sole purpose it was meant to do reduce global inventoriesSo now imagine this scenario as we approach the end of October oil continues to trade in the range of 80 to 90 While global oil inventories have drained materially sentiment remains weak and speculators believe the impending recession will hurt oil demand Saudis are now deciding whether to extend to the end of December but as they look at global oil supply  demand balances Q1 shows a build All of the efforts of the voluntary cut up to that point would be pointless if storage gets to build back up againWith the voluntary cut already in place whats to stop the Saudis from slowly unwinding the cut Perhaps its best to after Q1 to slowly unwind the 1 million bd cut as to avoid any inventory buildup In addition with Russia cooperating finally and if the Russians extend their voluntary cut into yearend then its physically very difficult for Russia to increase production during the heart of winter All of these things suggest to me that it is better than 50 chance that the Saudis extend this voluntary cut in some form or shape into the end of Q1 and possibly Q2 of 2024Now this is not the consensus view and many of the oil analysts expect the Saudis to unwind the voluntary cut once the storage draw has materialized but we digress We think the ultimate goal for the Saudis is price stability so if that implicitly implies a lower overall storage level to achieve this then the Saudis will keep the voluntary cut until they see fitThis means that Brent would have to easily average over 90 for many months before the Saudis contemplate a reduction We just dont see that when the consensus expects a build in Q1In the years Ive followed the Saudis this is the most determined Ive ever seen them If we are right and the Saudis continue to extend then the market will get a rude awakening Global onshore crude inventories are already starting to accelerate to the downside and theres more to come Perhaps like the article we published on Monday it is really just that straightforward Perhaps it is not We will know with timeEditors Note This article covers one or more microcap stocks Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocksFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are interested we can help    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,296,2023-08-26,5

53,"Forget MPLX, 3 Reasons To Buy Enterprise Products Partners Instead",MPLX  and Enterprise Products Partners  are both investment grade high yielding midstream businesses that have impressive track records of growing their distributions through good times and bad while also delivering very attractive longterm totalSince MPLX went public it has delivered total returns that have totally crushed those of the broader midstream sector EPD has also significantly outperformed AMLP over the long termThat said when comparing EPD with MPLX EPD emerges as the clear winner in terms of which is the better riskadjusted buy right now Here are three reasons whyEPD beats MPLX in this category hands down as evidenced by its sectorleading A credit rating compared to MPLXs BBB credit rating EPDs leverage ratio of 30x isAdditional metrics that support EPDs edge in this category are its robust 4 billion in liquidity substantial free cash flow generation net of distributions weighted average term to maturity on its debt of nearly 20 years including over half of which is termed out to 30 yearsMeanwhile while MPLX lacks the impressive debt maturity calendar that EPD has it is still expected to generate between 1214 billion in free cash flow net of distributions annually through 2027 and sums to only 1 billion less than the amount of debt that MPLX has maturing over that period As a result it is well positioned to soften the blow to its interest expense that may come from having to refinance debt at higher interest ratesAs a result we can conclude that both businesses have strong balance sheets but EPDs is still head and shoulders above MPLXsBoth businesses have strong and stable business models overallMPLX manages midstream energy infrastructure assets across two main segments 1 Logistics and Storage and 2 Gathering and Processing Their operations include handling natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil and other hydrocarbons They also transport products in the MidContinent and Gulf Coast and have terminals for refined petroleum As a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation  MPLX is uniquely positioned near Marathon refineries often serving as their exclusive provider This strategic location poses barriers for competitors Furthermore MPLXs longterm contracts with Marathon ensure stable cash flow making it resilient in the face of broader industry and macroeconomic fluctuationsEPDs toptier portfolio is diversified by asset energy type and geography with four key business segments 1 NGLs 2 Crude Oil 3 Natural Gas Pipelines  Services and 4 Petrochemical  Refined Products Services Its integrated business model and strategically located assets offer significant competitive advantages presenting numerous opportunities for highreturn investments and synergistic acquisitionsEPDs asset portfolio is overall better than MPLXs in our view as it has connections to every major US shale basin and owns strategically located export facilities out of the Gulf Coast Moreover its comprehensive NGL network offers unparalleled access to Mont Belvieu While MPLXs portfolio is also pretty good  especially its refining and Appalachiabased gathering and processing assets  it still lacks the strategic depth and breadth that EPD hasMoreover its larger scale and geographic and asset diversity give it access to more high returning low risk growth investment opportunities as well as bolton acquisitions EPDs diversified operational footprint spanning natural gas liquids crude oil natural gas and petrochemicals offers a balanced and resilient earnings profile In contrast MPLX is more concentrated geographically has greater tenant concentration risk and lacks the petrochemical exposure that EPD enjoys As a result we see EPD as having a more promising longterm growth profile compared to MPLXAnother big reason to favor EPD over MPLX is that EPDs insiders own a significant 32 of the companys equity This substantial stake not only underscores the managements belief in the companys longterm prospects but also ensures that their interests are aligned with those of the shareholdersMeanwhile MPLX is largely beholden to MPC which owns a large percentage of their equity and is also their primary business counterparty While MPLX benefits from the steady stream of business and operational synergies from its relationship with MPC it also exposes MPLX to the operational and financial risks associated with MPC Any adverse event affecting MPC could have an outsized effect on MPLX In contrast EPDs diversified client base and operations insulate it from such concentrated risks Moreover in the past MPC has sold mediocre assets to MPLX at a price that proved to be a bit rich via the Andeavor Logistics  There is always the chance that MPC could execute a similar transaction in the future which would likely hurt MPLX unitholder valueA final reason why we like EPD more than MPLX right now is that its valuation looks much more appealing MPLX currently trades at an EVEBITDA of 935x whereas EPD trades at a nearly identical EVEBITDA of 947x However when compared to their 10year averages EPDs valuation is at a more significant discount 1223x 10year average EVEBITDA for EPD compared to an 1164x 10year average EVEBITDA for MPLX Moreover on a fiveyear basis MPLXs EVEBITDA currently stands at a slight premium 925x fiveyear average EVEBITDA for MPLX whereas EPDs stands at a discount 991x fiveyear average EVEBITDA for EPDWhen factoring in EPDs stronger balance sheet overall superior business model greater insider alignment and less questionable ownership structure given MPLXs close relationship and dependence on MPC EPD appears to be a much more compelling riskadjusted buy right nowMPLX is not a bad investment opportunity either as its 93 next twelve month distribution yield  that is wellcovered by distributable cash flow  complements its fairly strong business model and balance sheet to make it an attractive income investment However EPDs very low risk balance sheet strong business model and even more compelling valuation make it the clear winner in the comparison of these two

61,Better High Yield Buy: Energy Transfer Or MPLX,  and   are both highyield BBBrated midstream infrastructure businesses Many investors prefer MPLX given that its distribution growth track record is much more consistent than ETs Note that MPLXs large jump andThat said ET has significantly outperformed MPLX in the nearly three years since we added it to our portfolioIn this article we compare them side by side and offer our take on which is the best buy right nowMPLX owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure andMPLXs assets are typically strategically located within or close to Marathon Petroleum refineries and typically serve as the sole providers for the refinerys specific needs creating economic barriers to entry for competitors Moreover MPLXs longterm 510year contracts with minimum volume commitments for each Marathon asset give it a very stable cash flow profile regardless of macro conditions in the energy industry and the broader economyET meanwhile owns and operates an extensive network of natural gas transportation pipelines including interstate natural gas pipelines storage facilities and gathering and processing assets in multiple states ET also sells natural gas to various customers including utilities power plants and industrial users Additionally the company is involved in crude oil transportation terminalling and marketing activities as well as the distribution of petroleum products such as gasoline and motor fuels It also offers services related to natural gas compression carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removal and manages coal and natural resource properties Unlike MPLX ET does not have a parent that owns a large stake in it nor is it beholden to a single large customerFurthermore ET has a much larger asset portfolio with an enterprise value that is nearly twice that of MPLXs Moreover it generates at least 11 and no more than 28 of its adjusted EBITDA from each of its five business segments crude oil NGL  refined products natural gas interstate transport  storage midstream and natural gas intrastate transport  storage giving it greater diversification than MPLX Similar to MPLX however is the fact that it generates the vast majority of its cash flow 90 of expected adjusted 2023 EBITDA from commodity priceresistant longterm feebased contacts As such it has a fairly defensive business model that is quite resilient in the face of macro volatilityOne important item to note is that  apart from a sharp dip during part of the COVID19 and SaudiRussian oil price warinduced energy market crash of 2020  MPLX has consistently generated significantly better returns on capital than ET has This indicates that its management team has been a better capital allocator than ETs has over the yearsBoth businesses have been deleveraging in recent years and both have BBB credit ratings with stable outlooks from SPETs leverage ratio is now under its 45x longterm target and is likely to stay within the 40x45x range for the foreseeable future depending on capital allocation opportunities for ET relative to the attractiveness of retiring rather than refinancing upcoming debt maturitiesOne major positive for ET is that it is expected to generate between 1718 billion in free cash flow net of distributions in 2024 24 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2025 31 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2026 and 35 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2027 This should enable it to cover most  if not all  of its upcoming debt maturities over that period of time As a result it enjoys significant flexibility in the face of growing uncertainty about the future outlook for interest rates As a result we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution levelMPLX meanwhile has an even lower leverage ratio of 35x down from 37x two years ago and 40x four years ago Moreover it has wellbalanced and very manageable debt maturities in the coming years Similar to ET it is expected to generate very healthy levels of free cash flow net of distributions over that time period as well It is expected to generate 1214 billion in free cash flow net of distributions each year through 2027 equating to a little over 5 billion in free cash flow net of distributions over that span In comparison it has about 6 billion in debt maturing over that period giving it significant capital markets flexibility and minimal need to access bond markets if it chooses not to in the face of rising interest rates As a result as with ET we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution levelAs already pointed out both distributions appear to be on very sound footing thanks to the stable cash flow profiles and strong balance sheets for both businesses Moreover MPLX is expected to cover its distribution by 156x this year and ET is expected to cover its distribution by 195x this year giving both distributions very adequate coverageThrough 2027 MPLX is expected to grow its distribution at a 50 CAGR while ET is expected to grow its distribution at a 43 CAGR ETs distribution is likely going to grow at a slower pace than MPLXs because it has more growth opportunities in front of it so management will be investing in those instead That being said it is interesting to note that ET is only expected to grow its DCF per unit at a 4 CAGR over that span whereas MPLX is expected to grow its DCF per unit at a nearly as strong 34 pace despite growing its distribution faster and not retaining nearly as much cash as ET is expected to This is because MPLX tends to generate higher returns on its capital thereby reducing its need to retain as much cash flow as ET does in order to deliver similar growth ratesET appears to be significantly cheaper than MPLX on an EVEBITDA and on a PDCF basis though both offer near identical current distribution yieldsET appears to be the winner here given that it is significantly cheaper than MPLX and its portfolio is also quite a bit more diversified However MPLX has generated consistently better returns on capital over the course of its history its distribution payout has proven to be more consistent and has grown at a faster clip over the long term Moreover MPLX currently offers the same yield as ET and is expected to grow its distribution at a slightly faster clip moving forward while also having a significantly lower leverage ratio As a result we can definitely see the case for holding MPLX over ETHowever what gives ET the edge in our view is that it is not beholden to a parentmajor client like MPLX is to MPC Between its greater portfolio diversification a wider array of growth projects significantly cheaper valuation and better governance structure we give the edge to ET though we rate both as BuysEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks

62,Marathon Oil: A Top-Tier Oil Play And Potential M&A Target,One of the things I discuss in almost every single oil and gasfocused article is the declining growth rates of US shale production After the Great Financial Crisis the shale revolution in the US caused the global oil supply to riseIn 2007 the US produced less than 1 million barrels of oil per day using unconventional drilling methods horizontal drillingshale When the pandemic hit in 2020 that number was slightly above 8 million barrels per daySince then that number has been unchangedThis has a number of reasons Among othersEven the only major oil basin in the United States that is still capable of growth the Permian is closing in on peak productionThis is what  wrote earlier this yearAs a result were seeing accelerating MA activityBecause of the XOMPXD deal I sold PXD and moved my money into Devon Energy  in a move that I explained in Now rumors are heating up that DVN is about to expand its business through MAIn other words its going from being an MA target to becoming an MA initiator its potential goal is Marathon Oil  a company that I have often called In this article Ill discuss the info we have so far and the reasons that make MRO such a fantastic stock regardless of MA chatterSo lets get to itRoughly ten years ago we had a massive trend of healthcarebiotech takeovers Low rates and innovation demand caused companies to engage in multibillion dollar dealsNow its energy thats making headlinesA few days ago Bloomberg  that Devon Energy is working on a major MA deal including Marathon and CrownRock which is a private drillerAccording to Bloomberg Devon has engaged in initial discussions in recent months regarding a potential merger with Marathon Oil insiders revealed preferring to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the discussionsThis move is strategically sound as both companies operate within a similar geographical footprint focusing on several basins in the Midwestern US particularly in Oklahoma Texas and New MexicoAs we can see in the map above and the overview below Marathon Oils portfolio primarily centers on its core operations in US resource plays and Equatorial Guinea In the US their primary focus includes the followingThis is what the production map of Devon Energy looks likeIn its international arena Marathon Oil conducts oil and gas exploration development and production operations in Equatorial Guinea Their activities include owning and operating a liquefied petroleum gas LPG processing plant and facilities for liquefied natural gas LNG and methanol productionWith that in mind the companys production doesnt just align with Devons production but the company also holds substantial reservesHaving said that theres more to it than overlapping assets and deep inventoriesAs I briefly mentioned this article isnt just aimed at explaining why DVN might buy MRO In general MRO is a fantastic oil play So even if MA chatter doesnt lead to anything it wont hurt the value MRO brings to the tableIn light of the aforementioned oil and gas production numbers going into 2024 the company plans to maintain maintenancelevel oil production maximizing sustainable free cash flow and prioritizing shareholder distributions and pershare growth another example of a company prioritizing free cash flow over production growthThey also expect to lead the peer group on key metrics in 2024 benefiting from potential market deflation and a significant financial uplift from increased exposure to the global LNG marketOne of the metrics that makes MRO look good versus its peers is the breakeven price the company needs to cover its costs Excluding any dividends MRO is breakeven close to 40 WTI Next year that number is expected to drop well below 40Thanks to its efficient business the company has a rather aggressive capital spending plan When oil prices are above 60 it aims to return at least 40 of its operating cash flow to shareholders with room to potentially grow production by 5In the second quarter of this year the company generated 531 million of adjusted free cash flow and returned 434 million of capital to shareholders representing a 10 increase in shareholder distributions compared to the first quarterThey expect further improvement in financial delivery in the second half of the year driven by higher expected production and lower capital spendingReturning significant capital to shareholders remains a fundamental part of their value propositionIn the first two quarters of 2023 they returned over 830 million to shareholders representing 40 of adjusted CFO and translating to a doubledigit shareholder distribution yield on an annualized basis which is the highest in their peer groupThis yield is nothing to write home about as MRO is a buybackfocused companySince the spike in energy prices less than three years ago MRO has bought back 23 of its sharesAs a result the pershare value of the company rises which includes production per share and profit per shareIt also helps that the company has an investmentgrade BBB credit rating This year the company is expected to lower net debt to 50 billion which is roughly 1x expected EBITDAAdding to this the company is becoming a bigger player in the LNG industryStarting from January 1 2024 the company is set to change its LNG pricing strategyCurrently they sell LNG linked to Henry Hub pricing but they plan to transition to selling it in the global LNG marketThis shift is expected to take advantage of potential pricing arbitrage between Henry Hub and global LNG pricing possibly resulting in increased financial returnsTo further maximize LNG production and take advantage of these new commercial terms the company is actively assessing a 2well infill drilling program at AlbaThis program targets highconfidence lowexecutionrisk opportunities to mitigate base decline and maximize equity molecules through the LNG plant under the more attractive global LNGlinked pricingThe company also has a longterm focus on the gas megahub concept in West Africa They aim to leverage their infrastructure in a gasrich region to extend the life of EG LNG well into the next decadeIm very excited about these developments and would like it if DVN and MRO combined their businesses I think adding a new layer of LNG capabilities to its business would be a terrific longterm opportunityAlso MRO is an outperformer Fueled by postpandemic buybacks MRO has returned close to 50 over the past five years beating its peers in the oil and gas exploration and production industryIn light of my outlook on higher oil prices and my belief that we could witness a prolonged period of tripledigit dollar oil prices I believe that MRO is significantly undervalued which is mainly based on its free cash flow sensitivity the hypothetical free cash flow chart I showedGiven that MRO could generate more than 20 in free cash flow at 95 WTI and favorable natural gas prices I believe that the stock is at least 40 to 50 undervalued with much higher gains over the next five to ten yearsThe current consensus price target is 33 which is roughly 18 above the current priceIn a world where the oil and gas industry is undergoing significant changes one thing is clear US shale production is facing a new realityThe days of skyrocketing growth seem to be behind us and the industry is shifting towards a focus on free cash flow and sustainabilityThe latest buzz revolves around potential MA activity in the sector particularly with Devon Energy eyeing Marathon OilWhile the merger talks are intriguing what makes Marathon Oil truly special extends beyond MA chatter Their commitment to maximizing sustainable free cash flow and shareholder value is commendableMarathon Oils strategic moves in LNG pricing and expansion along with their consistent buybacks make them a standout performer in the industryWith a promising outlook for higher oil prices MROs stock appears significantly undervalued offering the potential for substantial gains in the coming yearsHaving said all of this in this evolving energy landscape Marathon Oil is a hidden gem worth keeping an eye on

64,There Is Way Too Much Misinformation On U.S. Oil Production,Thanks to the EIAs new quest of eliminating the adjustment factor people are now completely misunderstanding US oil productionIn EIAs latest weekly oil storage report it rebenchmarked US weekly oil production higher by 300k bd For those of you who areBut at the start of the year the new EIA administrator following months of scrutiny on the unexplainable elevated adjustment figure decided to embark on a study to identify why the adjustment is so high During this study period it found that transfers to crude oil and underreported US crude production were factors that contributed to elevated adjustmentFrom what weve seen so far in the monthly reports roughly 500k bd to 600k bd are attributed to transfers to crude oil while the remainder was attributed to underreported productionTaking all this into account our methodology of always using the adjustment to calculate real supply in the US was unchanged by this methodology change from the EIAYou can see this in our oil production matrixNow you will notice that bluedotted line going straight up Thats the EIA attempting to explain away the ridiculous weekly adjustment figureBut we want you to take a closer look at our production matrix If you go all the way back to May 2018 you will notice the closely fitted lines amongst all of the things we track By 2019 there was a separation between reported US oil production EIA 914 and the EIA 914  adjustment figure Thats when transfers to crude oil became a much bigger thing which in our view is likely what caused adjustment to start becoming so elevatedIn fact the adjustment became such a big issue that we started incorporating plant condensate or our version of the adjustment into our weekly US crude storage estimates And since weve started tracking this it averaged 500k bd from 2018 to 2023But this is where things get really interestingIf you look at our modified adjustment we only separate out actual imports and exports to what EIA reports But if US oil production is structurally underreported then our modified adjustment will be elevated regardless Similarly with the methodology change that the EIA has adopted our modified adjustment will become structurally lower going forward Netnet there wont be any real change to the supply side since all of this has been included from the beginningSo to summarize EIAs attempt at solving the mysteries of the adjustment factor is leading the public to believe that theres been a major surge in US oil production when in fact its the exact oppositeNow lets talk about the fun stuffIn our latest associated gas production update weve seen a meaningful drop in production You will notice that this is in stark contrast to what we are seeing on the crude production sideIn addition if we look at our highfrequency US oil production tracking we dont see it making a new high by yearendIn essence we dont expect US oil production to push higher going forward Without an uptick in associated gas production EIAs own adjustment figure is going to tip into a consistent negative which will suggest that US oil production is overstated at 132 million bdBeware of oil tourists talking about how US oil production increased 12 million bd from the end of last year to today They dont know what they are talking aboutThe reality is that US oil production is growing but because we are comparing apples to oranges yoy comparisons become irrelevant when discussing US oil production going forward You can thankblame the EIA for that oneThank you for reading this article We launched our oil trading portfolio in 2019 The oil trading portfolio is designed to take advantage of shortterm longshort oil and energy stock trades in the market For readers interested in our positioning along with realtime trades    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,19,2023-10-20,5

68,Chevron Offers Smoother Ride In Any Oil Market,Owning energy stocks can be like riding a roller coaster with no idea of when the ups and downs will come or how long they will lastWhile leveraged exploration and production companies provide the most thrill the reasonablyThe forward priceearnings ratio of 121 is way below the SP 500  ratio of 191 This lower multiple is typical of oil and gas stocks which have been out of favor due to volatility and climate change concernsThe shares are in the middle of their 52week range and sell for less than the Morningstar fair value estimate of 172The chart shows that except after the COVID19 oil bust of 2020 when free cash flowChevron management assumes a 12 return on capital at a base price of 60 realized barrel far below recent prices The company can operate normally even when Brent crude is at 50 executive vice president Nigel Hearne saidWith interest rates rising the market has been punishing companies that need to finance their growth Chevron has a sterling balance sheet with a debttoequity ratio below 15 percent the lowest among the largest US oil producersAfter backing out cash the net debt ratio is only 7 Why is this important Because oil prices while in a multidecade upward trend fluctuate widely Any company that knows where and how to stick holes in the ground can make money when prices are high But companies with a strong balance sheet also benefit when prices are low by buying distressed competitorsAn example of Chevrons capital discipline is how it withdrew from its tentative deal for Anadarko Petroleum in 2019 allowing Occidental Petroleum to take the bidding war with Warren Buffetts assistance rather than pay a price it viewed as excessive The company came out of the deal with a But when prices and valuations collapsed in 2020 Chevron was quick to buy Noble Energy with complementary assets in the Permian and DJ basins for only Contrast that with Exxon Mobils  recent deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for 595 billion With PXD having 24 billion barrels of proven reserves that works out to nearly 25 a share Obviously a lot of other factors besides reserves go into a valuation but the difference of 500 cant be ignoredWhile the 202122 rise in oil prices led to an SPleading rise in Occidental shares over that period Chevron stock has still done better since the 2019 battle And thats the pointowners of Chevron dont have to time the oil price cycle correctly to profit in the long termChevron is the only US oil company that holds a waiver from US sanctions to produce in Venezuela The Biden administration is negotiating to reduce sanctions in return for some semblance of a return to democracy According to Bloomberg  to drill new wells in 2024Venezuelan production is particularly profitable at the refining end because the country produces the heavy grades of crude that Gulf refiners need to balance out the light grades and even lighter condensate that comes from fracking in the Permian BasinThe draining of US crude inventories since the COVID peak in 2020 becomes clear when one takes the weekly Energy Information Agency figures and adds the governments Strategic Petroleum Reserve as done hereOil prices depend on factors outside US control such as Saudi policy and Mideast war fears Still given the tight domestic supplies the more likely direction for oil prices is up when seasonal driving demand resumes next springThe company plans to increase production at a compound annual rate of 3 through 2027 It has profitable opportunities in the Permian Basin Colorados DJ Basin Argentina the Gulf of Mexico Kazakhstan and elsewhere but limits its expansion through capital discipline It expects a free cash flow of 5 billion a year by 2025 Upstream earnings per unit are expected to grow 50 at flat prices over the next five years Chevron has a forward yield of 362 which is lower than others in the sector mainly because its stock is valued more highly It has made raising dividends its top financial priority with 36 consecutive years of increases one of only two energy companies along with XOM on the In a recent  CEO Mike Wirth said the company has raised dividends at a compound annual growth rate of 6 for the last 15 years including a 6 rise this year Our dividend growth per share has been double that of our closest peersSince oil is a cyclical business CVX manages to keep the dividend growing in downturns by keeping a lot of cash on hand and adjusting its capital return by reducing or eliminating share buybacks when necessary This year swimming in cash from last years high prices the company  to 175 billion a yearThe main shortterm risk is a decline in oil prices due to a weak economy as during the 2020 COVID19 crisis The process was selfcorrecting however as drilling reductions quickly followed and demand reboundedThere is plenty of political risk ranging from government actions that would stop production in Venezuela to  expansion to a warinduced  to  The company has decades of experience managing risks and is diversified enough that any single crisis doesnt make much of a change in the overall outlookThe biggest risk is a global move away from oil and gas as the climatechange energy transition continues The International Energy Agency believes demand will peak by the end of the decade but OPEC vociferously disagrees and My view is that increases in the standard of living of lesserdeveloped countries will more than offset consumption declines in industrialized nations In addition growing tensions between the US and its allies and the ChinaRussiaIran axis will cause both sides to not make dramatic reductions in fossil fuel consumption that could endanger their economic output often a decisive factor in warsEnergy transition risks are also mitigated by the companys pledge to invest 10 billion by 2028 in carbon capture and greenhouse gas reduction projectsA longterm chart shows Chevrons total returns have been comparable to those of the SP 500 ETF Trust  and much higher than the Energy Select Sector SPDR Chevron is a longestablished compounder of cash flow and dividends It is not the most

69,Africa Oil Corp.'s Promising Future,Africa Oil Corporation   is a smalltomidcap oil company that weve discussed numerous times The company has had a tumultuous journey However the company has cleaned up its positioning substantially and as well see throughout this article it has theAfrica Oil Corporation has an interesting historyThe company started trying to make oil production in Kenya come alive It hit the point with its partners that it was producing and trucking oil Unfortunately it was unable to build sufficient takeaway infrastructure with a proposed pipeline costing more than 1 billion An inability to solve that meant that the company recently backed away from the projectHowever a unique opportunity stumbled on the companys plate It managed during uncertainty about oil portfolios during COVID19 to buy a 50 shareholding in Prime Oil and Gas That was anNow we are at an inflection The company has some new assets that its working on developing but whether that pans out as Prime Oil and Gas tones down remains to be seenThe company had strong financial results for the quarterThe company maintains a strong cash position and earned 1069 million in net income That came as it got additional payouts from Prime Oil and Gas which represents its only source of income At the same time Prime Oil and Gas net debt remains incredibly manageable and backed by reserves The company has worked to clean up that balance sheet enabling dividendsIts worth noting that the company made this acquisition just a few years ago and its already paid back the entire acquisition price Thats an indication of the strength of the dealThe companys guidance indicates a potential riskThe companys production has concurrently dropped a legacy of the fact that the company purchased legacy assets Production is line with management guidance but it is down noticeably YoY FCF does remain strong at an estimated 200 million for the year supported by higher crude oil prices recentlyThe company is in a much better but similar position to where it was with its Kenyan assets several years ago Its existing assets are getting weaker and the company needs to find an alternative source of production It has some exciting discoveries but theyll take years to commercialize In the meantime cash flow and driving shareholder returns will become tougherThe company has made some exciting oil discoveries that could help its longterm shareholder returnsThe massive discovery could be a company maker at a minimum of  Additional drilling is being done to define the limits of the asset The strength of the asset is such that there are now two companies drilling there The company participated in Impacts capital raise and has a 6 stake in the blocks that could soon be producing hundreds of thousands of barrels  dayThat stake in our view means the potential of thousands of barrels  day of production if not tens of thousands for Africa Oil Corporation The project will likely start with a single FPSO and grow from therePutting this all together Africa Oil Corporation has the ability to drive substantial shareholder returnsThe company has a 11 billion USD market capitalization Prime Oil and Gas debt is nonrecourse to the company The company pays out an annualized dividend at roughly 2 The company has continued to receive dividends from Prime Oil and Gas an acquisition thats been paid off at a double digit yield for the companyWe expect the company to opportunistically repurchase shares and maintain its overall asset strength The company halted share repurchases after prices dropped in 2022 but it maintains the financial strength to repurchase shares Wed like to see it ramp up its The largest risk to our thesis is crude oil prices The company has been heavily supported by OPEC and its commitment to keep production lower boosting prices However that could change and so could the longterm potential of the industry Replacement ratios helps but we expect the industry to be dramatically different in a few decades hurting its longterm potentialAfrica Oil Corporation is at another crossroads its first major crossroads since the Prime Oil and Gas acquisition That acquisition represented the companys best decision in its history and made up for some poor decisions made with the companys assets in Kenya and its plan to produce there a plan that it finally gave up onThe company has managed to pay off that entire acquisition and now it needs to shift towards shareholder returns It also needs to plan for the future as the asset declines The Venus discovery has incredibly high potential and drilling is continuing there It needs to see a path to starting production but once it does we can see the asset being incredibly valuable making the company a strong

74,Oil Price Mini-Crash Is A Gift For Investors,With the market fixated on bond yields with the 30year and 10year Treasury Rate approaching 50 the bigger story right now is likely the minicrash in crude oil prices few expected Indeed WTI crude oil  isThe selloff here likely reflects the combination of some softer economic indicators along with a building The sense is that a rush by producers worldwide including Russia to take advantage of elevated prices on the supply side is coming up against some softer demandThe setup here has some major implications not only for inflation expectations and the direction of interest rates but also represents a positive development for the stock market Our article here reaffirms a bullish view of theThe first point here is that its becoming less and less likely the Fed will need to hike rates again this year This is confirmed by the  tool tracking the marketimplied probability at 64 that the Fed Funds rate will now end the year flat from the current level of 55 On the other hand the odds for another rate hike in 2023 have dropped to 36 compared to 47 just yesterdayConsidering it was the run in energy prices that ruffled the hawkish feathers suggesting to some that inflation was set to accelerate the correction in oil turns that view upside down Our confidence that the Fed wont hike again has been strengthenedLooking ahead to the September CPI report set to be released on October 12 the market can focus more on the core measures that exclude volatile energy prices On this point the trends have been much more favorable and confirm the disinflationary process is well underwayThe annual core CPI hit 43 in the last August update with the more dynamic threemonth annualized measure at a very mundane 24 What we have here is evidence that the Feds strategy is working and further rate hikes are unnecessary for the headline rate to converge towards the target 20 down the lineWith a building consensus that inflationary pressures are easing the next step is to see a downside to interest rates and bond yields There are many ways to interpret the yield curve Its fair to say that a large part of the recent spike in rates reflects a concern that inflation was set to remain elevated and the Fed would need to at least hold rates for longerIf we can agree that the price of oil is going to remain relatively contained around the current level for the foreseeable future longterm rates can be limited to the upsideComments by Chairman Powell at the September Fed meeting opened the door but did not commit to another hike urging a sense of caution We know the Fed is datadependent and the takeaway here is that with the latest drop in oil prices the data that matters looks pretty good on the inflation frontThe bullish case for bonds considers a scenario where the CPI trends lower faster than expected opening the door for the Fed to cut earlier rather than later into 2024Importantly this could occur even as economic conditions remain resilient in a soft landing environment because inflation expectations anchored to the target level would justify such a move and not because the economy is collapsingBy removing that headwind of surging oil prices which was one factor contributing to the crash in the bond market spike in yields and climbing inflation expectations the setup for stocks gets a new tailwind of sentimentInvestors can start looking forward to the upcoming earnings season which gets underway later this month with all indications that companies captured a solid operating environment in Q3We see room for the SP 500 to climb right back to its recent highs of around 4600 as a yearend price target The environment of resilient economic conditions as interest rates stabilize while corporate earnings climb supports a bullish view We also expect the reset of inflation expectations lower based on the latest energy price correction to drive some short covering in both the stock and bond market as a nearterm catalystTo conclude by covering some of the risks the potential that the price of oil regains strength quickly climbing above 100 a barrel can drive some renewed inflationary

75,Ecopetrol: Oil Stock For Adventurous Dividend Seekers,One of South Americas primary oil majors is Ecopetrol  The company has robust finances growing profitability and an expanding reserve base It pays dividends with generous yields and is cheap using percentile ranking and EVEBITDA vsThe most prominent players in South America are Petrobras  YPF  Vista Energy  and Ecopetrol The chart below compares their shares performance against WTI and Exxon Mobile The Latin American companies have achieved impressive returns led by VIST and YPF with tripledigit ROI PBR and EC follow with a respectable 50 ROI The laggard is XOM Its worth mentioning that the WTI price moved by 358 YoY while South American oil and gas producers gained exceptional returnsIn two years I expect the crude price to reach new highs above 150barrel due to growingEcopetrol SA operations are spread across exploration and production refined products and petrochemicals renewable energy and biofuels electric power transmission and toll road concessionsEcopetrol had over 9127 kilometers of crude oil and multipurpose pipelines as of December 31 2022 Additionally it manufactures and markets masterbatches polypropylene resins and compounds and sells industrial and specialized management servicesThe company conducts business in South America Asia Central America the Caribbean Europe and Colombia The chart below from the last EC  details the three main pillars of Ecopetrol operationsColombia has exposure on the two sides of the Panama Canal the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean The former is vital for fossil fuel discoveries because it shares borders with Venezuela the global leader in oil reserves On the other hand the Pacific shelf of the country carries significant potential tooThe map below shows the Caribbean basins colossal The blue squares indicate assets developed with Occidental Petroleum EC has a 40 interest in the project  yellow blocks is one of the most significant discoveries on the Columbian shelf EC owns 50 and Shell will develop the project Gorgon 2 is a deepwater discovery and is considered the largest in Colombia Another notable asset is  green blocks created with Petrobras Those discoveries illustrate Colombian oil and gas deepwater potentialReplacing its reserves faster than depleting them is a matter of survival for any extractive business EC maintains a solid replacement ratio of 130 over five years The proven reserves have grown constantly since 2016 though the reservetoproduction ratio is 84 years Petrobras has 122 years for comparisonThe reservetoproduction ratio  in the last few years among all majors The chart below from  shows the downward trend in US and European oil majorsConsidering the potential for another significant deepwater discovery I expect EC reserves to grow improving the reservetoproduction ratioThe chart below gives details on EC assetsThe oil majors have improved their balance sheets since the 2020 crash Although EC did not significantly cut its liabilities the company maintains moderate debt levels The table below shows the companys debtequity multiples and interest rate coverageTotal DebtEquity at 1065 is far from overleveraged The excellent interest rate coverage provides EC with a significant buffer against declining oil prices and liquidity issuesThe company holds 27 billion of cash reserves while the current portion of its longterm debt is 389 billion Ecopetrols total debt is 2589 billion The table below from  shows the companys debt profileThe top part of the chart gives the maturity dates and the amount of debt 72 of the companys debt has a fixed interest rate between 49 International corporate bonds comprise 72 of Ecopetrols debt The maturities are well diversified across durations In the coming four years the company must repay 912 billion 207 billion in 2023 259 billion in 2024 202 billion in 2025 and 262 billion in 2026The company has enough cash on hand to cover the current portion of the debt Besides that it realized 446 billion in free cash flow TTM Even at the current oil prices Ecopetrol generates excess cash flows sufficient to cover its debt obligationsThe companys profitability remains stable as seen in the graph below Even in 2020 a challenging year globally the company had positive returnsSince then the EBITDA margin has remained above 40 and the Return on Total Capital is above 12The graph below shows the Total Debt to Capital axis and the Y axis of Return on Capital The blue dots represent oil and gas producers from South AmericaEC is third next to Petrobras and Vista Energy with ROIC at 1654 and debttocapital level at 5157 The company achieves strong returns without being overleveragedSimilarly I analyze FCF and CAPEX as  of RevenueEC realized a 357 FCF yield and 1497 CAPEX as a percentage of Revenue Petrobras again leads the group with a 3618 FCF yield but 961 capital investments to revenue Looking at the big picture EC is a strong performer in the top percentile of South American oil and gas producers The same could be said about the leverage the company maintains a safe level of debtI use comparative valuation to estimate Ecopetrols standing I prefer EVSales and EVEBITDA multiples The chart below compares EC multiples with the companys tenyear average and South American oil and gas industry figuresEVSales NTM is lower than 36 of the energy companies in South America while is significantly lower 75 than Ecopetrols tenyear average Based on EVEBITDA NTM the company is even cheaper than 64 of its regional peers and its tenyear averageEcopetrol distributes dividends with a respectable yield of 785 while maintaining EVEBITDA at 33 Given both indicators it is one of the top five enterprises in the regionBased on the data discussed the company is still cheap Great company and reasonable price is not enough The missing element is the timingEcopetrol price action offers an excellent entry point The SQN indicator is in a bull quiet regime while the price is above the 30 monthly moving average MMA and rebounded from a notable support levelThe markets peak in a bull volatile regime while entries in the bull quote green and neutral yellow the odds are skewed in investors favor That does not mean a zerofail rate of the SQN signals SQN is a tool that increases signal reliability when combined with other analytical methods macro fundamental narrativeI want to point out something about the trendlines too The steeper the line the less reliable it is as supportresistance Steep trendlines tend to morph into other chart patterns while giving a lot of false breakout signals The lowest signal fail rate holds multiyear horizontal trendlines The blue line is not steep and has been notable support for eight years Simply put it could be a credible tool to assess the price actionThe price is above 30MMA increasing the riskreward ratio Putting all together EC price action affirms my thesis and provides an entry point with asymmetric risk rewardCrude oil is the true blood of the economy Its price depends not only on economic fluctuations but also on geopolitical tensions The turmoil in the Middle East is another confirmationThe turmoil in Europe and the Levant benefited South American oil companies It will push investors and consumers to seek safer alternatives to Middle East oil such as South America The former produces more than 307 million barrels daily while the latter less than 78 million If 5 of Middle East productions move to South America the demand in the region will increase by 20Companies extracting fossil fuels in the Latin American region will become more attractive to investors The continent has been the most peaceful for over a century with zero interstate hot wars On the other hand there have been countless interstate conflicts in Africa the Middle East and Eastern Europe Caucasus region included for the last 30 yearsOperating in a peaceful region is crucial for complex endeavors such as mining and oilgas extractions Those industries depend heavily on global logistics for spare parts personnel and shipping The internal troubles inherent to the region such as corruption inequality and inflation are less adverse than geopolitical tensions for natural resource companiesA global recession might affect oil demand but there will be a brief demand squeeze Commodities such as copper are more sensitive to economic cycles Copper demand rises considerably in a growing economy and declines in poor economic conditions Oil demand shows a higher degree of indifference during economic recessions Oil prices suffer abrupt declines yet quickly recoverAs with every commodity oil prices are dictated by the CAPEX cycle in the long term So it affects the supply While demand projections are daunting the supply depends on relativity known variables like costs and time to develop a new project Of course they vary but ultimately they rely on three inputs capital resources and laborThe most prominent risk is the Government of Columbia which owns 88 of the company and is the largest shareholder Colombia is one of the countries in the region with the best  such as growing foreign direct investments government debt to GDP at 55 and total private debt to GDP at 106 The incumbent president is the leftwing Gustavo Petro His election is part of the pink tide in the continent that started with Chavez in Venezuela and has spread to different degrees in the region Almost all incumbent presidents in South America are from leftwing parties Besides we have positive examples of Brazilian President Lulas pragmatic economic policies Gustavo Petro tries to emulate Lulas approachLifting the sanctions on Venezuelas oil will act as a safety valve and suppress the oil prices in the short term However I believe this will have a temporary effect The fundamentals are lined up for a longterm bull run in crudeOil and Gas stocks can potentially become the new darlings of the investors They distribute dividends offer asymmetry and benefit from geopolitical turmoil Ecopetrol is an alternative to the usual suspects Occidental Shell BP and Conoco The company has the advantage of operating in Colombia The conflict in the Middle East will push the global oil demand especially in safer regions such as South AmericaSince the oil crash in March 2020 the company has recovered its profitability while maintaining adequate leverage The company has enough cash on hand to cover the current portion of the debt Besides that it realized 446 billion in free cash flow TTM Even at the current oil prices Ecopetrol generates excess cash flows sufficient to cover its debt obligations The company distributes dividends with a respectable yield of 785  while maintaining EVEBITDA at 33 Given both indicators it is one of South Americas top five oil companies Ecopetrol is a solid oil company for adventurous

76,"This Is No Time For Celebration, The Oil Rally Is Just Getting Started",In our WCTW this Monday we wrote that the oil market  is not prepared for whats coming The US has in essence bailed out the rest of the world from an oil supply shortage but that is about to comeWe are already seeing eyepopping backwardation and theres more to comeIf you thought MarchApril 2022 was bad you havent seen the real thing yet We are talking about real supply cuts this time not some fantasy potential supply dropWhat makes this time even more beautiful is that theAnd similar to the path the IEA took when Russia invaded Ukraine telling the world that Russian oil production would fall by 3 million bd this time around it is preaching the exact opposite ample supplyBut as the title of this OMF suggests this is no time for celebration this is no time for pats on the back because this is only just getting startedOur latest US crude storage forecast shows nonexistent crude builds during refinery maintenance season We have one last rush of US crude exports and thats it US crude storage will likely stay flat to higher into yearend because US crude exports will fall This is what we expect and the end result is a much tighter global oil market environmentSo for readers trying to stay ahead of the curve please do not expect US commercial crude storage to fall well below 400 million bbls We are already tight and so the market will force relief one way or anotherOne of the bear factors was demand but demand is holding up well Unlike some of the bulls argue we dont see demand as being robust but its not terrible like the bears are claiming Refining margins will continue to remain under pressure as crude tightness gets even tighter Bears will point to falling refining margins as a sign of demand weakness when in reality its just crude tightnessOil in the meantime will continue to climb the wall of worries Recession high interest rates lower refining margins OPEC spare capacity all of these things will prevent people from seeing the bigger picture and thats that the marginal supply has all but peakedAnd the US being the largest growth in supply over the last decade is all but on its last leg The oil market is firmly in the hands of the Saudis and they can do however they please going forwardSo this is no time for celebration because its only just getting started Buckle up extreme tightness in the physical market is comingFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are interested we can help    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,112,2023-09-27,5
77,Transocean: May Soar By 200% In The Next 36 Months,Transocean s stock is struggling to get past the 9 resistance line But if everything goes the way it is going now then the stock may trade well in the double digits as soon as this year In fact Here are a few quotes from the  where Jeremy Thigpen Transoceans CEO summarizes the contract awards of the past quarterIn the UK a contract was signed at a rate of 175000 per day adding approximately 175 million to the companys backlog So far Brazils day rates seem to be the best So from this release we can clearly see that the contracts were concluded at reasonably high rates and in different regions of operation But most importantly in the past quarter alone 13 billion in new backlog was added which is really substantial Soon after the earnings conference call two more contracts were announced The first one was the 222M ultradeepwater drillship contract awarded by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd for the  for work offshore India The second one was a 486M contract for the Deepwater Aquila drillship All this signals a clear improvement in Transoceans business activityIn addition to the new contracts announced the company also issued some debt Transocean Aquila Limited Transoceans wholly owned indirect subsidiary commenced a private offering of 300M of senior secured notes due 2028 In other words RIG had to borrow money to afford Aquila the new build But I do not think the debt load increase will be that significantIn order to have a better idea of Transoceans debt situation let us have a look at the companys debt history The data were obtained from Morning Stars websiteIf we have a look at Transoceans total liabilities these were substantially lower in 2Q 2023 compared to the year 2020 As concerns the companys total debt it has been falling since 2020 So the general picture seems to be improving Even if the debt load rises by 300 million nothing horrible will happen it seems Not to mention that Aquila the new asset will generate cash flows and revenuesTransocean has been criticized for having too many coldstacked rigs But it does not mean these coldstacked rigs will have to be recycled Rather the opposite is true  its coldstacked rigs by bidding them on open tenders or through direct negotiations Transocean has 10 coldstacked ultradeepwater rigs and 1 harsh environment semisubmersible Interestingly 8 of these vessels are highly demanded sixth and seventhgeneration drillships Globally there are just 12 of these coldstacked vessels and 4 stranded new builds that are now owned by anyoneThe market for offshore drilling equipment is currently far too tight whilst it takes years to construct an ultradeepwater ship and also plenty of money investments Even if we assume the budget to reactivate a deepwater or an ultradeepwater drillship is above 75125 million it will still be substantially lower compared to the amount of money used to construct say the new 7th generation drillship Deepwater Aquila So apart from the warmstacked or active rigs coldstacked drillships can still potentially be reactivated and used to generate cash flows and revenues According to one of the recent Transocean  buying and activating a stranded shipyard asset could result in an investment of 300  500 million substantially more than any reactivation of any coldstacked shipIn my recent article I wrote quite for the oil prices this coming winter The fossil fuel markets in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere in general are very tight and more is yet to come it seems I absolutely agree that offshore drillers invest for the long term Seasonal oil price fluctuations are not a very good reason to invest in costly offshore exploration of course However if the oil markets remain tight the supply stays low and green energy sources do not manage to become a perfect alternative to fossil fuels in the next several years then oil majors will keep investing in offshore drilling whilst signing new contracts with Transocean of Cushing Oklahoma the US major oil storage hub once again showed a Once again investors were reminded of the tight global supply In fact crude has soared by about 40 over the past three months This summer was really bullish for oil Not only are Saudi Arabia and Russia willing to cut the supply Inventory levels in Cushing have decreased by almost 50 since June So they are now at less than 23 million barrels This is close to the operational minimum But if the storage levels fall below 20 million barrels the oil can become difficult to remove which will again add to oil market deficits According to Investing Group Leader  US crude storage will not build during refinery maintenance season in October So the only bearish factor is demand destruction which is not happening right nowI agree that  After all higher inflation readings can lead to further rate hikes by the Fed and other central banks Moreover as I have mentioned before Transoceans business benefits from longterm demand However there is a correlation between RIGs stock price and the oil pricesAt the same time in my opinion the companys stock price is currently trading quite low compared to the oil pricesThis is explainable of course After all before the 20142015 crisis RIG used to have a larger fleet higher revenues and cash flows But still there could be some growth potential given the current situationTransoceans stock has been on the rise in the last several years You can say that all rallies eventually pass But it seems that the momentum is really strong for this stock If you just draw the trend line assuming that the wider recovery of the offshore drilling sector continues you will see that the stock price will be well in the double digits by 2024 or at the beginning of 2024 at the latestFundamental analysis is much more superior to any trend following Anything can happen For example no one knew back in 2019 that the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdowns would drive the oil prices to negative values But if everything goes the way it is currently going then we can see RIG in the double digits by 2024If we see Transoceans current valuation multiples we will see that they are at multiyear highsHowever they are still not extremely high if we compare these to the SP 500s averages For example the SP 500s average PS pricetosales ratio is currently  whilst RIGs PS is 231 SP 500s pricetocash flow ratio is 1532 whilst Transoceans is less than 12 Yes most SP 500 companies are currently profitable but RIG is expected to report a sound net profit next yearThe risks are clear First as I have mentioned many times before this is the likelihood the Fed and other central banks would raise the interest rates thus provoking a fullscale recession Then the oil supply situation may change The OPEC may start extracting more oil whilst US oil majors may also do the same After all all rallies endYou might also say that Transocean is not free of debt and is overvalued But paradoxically in an upcycle this is the companys big advantage In other words RIGs stock is more sensitive to any good announcements because it is more speculative than its peers  Valaris  Noble   that have emerged from bankruptcy and are now almost free of debtSo the most important thing now for Transocean is the continuation of an upcycle I thinkTransocean is in a very good situation it seems The oil market is tight and is highly likely to stay so in the near future New contracts get announced and the debt load is not as high as it was in 2020 RIG is expected to report a sound net profit in 2024 The stock has a very strong momentum too In my view the biggest risks are that of a prolonged recession and a supply glut In my view however the increase of 200 in the next 36 months may not be too farfetched RIG stock may trade in the double digits as early as 2024   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No

78,Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),Over most of the past year I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads I  my longterm bullish take on MarathonHowever as discussed more recently  Ive downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash  in the crack spread As such it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon considering its stock remains generally high However its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopoliticalrelated production cuts Overall investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum depending on how we calculate its forward valuationFor the most part refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly My longterm view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today That said the shortterm outlook has changed as volatility mounts raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022 However oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around 87 per barrel today Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil  Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped Marathon has retained much of its value but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income The crack spread is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs crude oil has crashed particularly for the gasoline spread See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profitLuckily Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of 32barrel to 19barrel today That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above All else being equal this 12barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of 1296 annualized 324B quarterly  have only changed marginally over this period Natural gas has also hardly changed so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathons refining marginsThe company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023 However this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathons current EBITDA See belowHistorically Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around 15 depending on changes in other operating costs Today that spread is below its typical range before COVID19 indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around 15B per quarter from its Midstream segment In comparison its refining margins can vary from negative  seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage Its refining segment EBITDA was 316B in Q2 and may be as low as 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant Combined with an expected 15B from Midstream I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at 142B given limited changes in commodity prices and volumesMarathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the  I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period The spread averaged  during most of that period or about 5 greater than the previous quarter All else being equal that equates to a 135B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2 giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of 566BMarathons Depreciation and Amortization has run around 830M and its interest is currently around 142M quarterly Together this creates an extra 972M added quarterly cost Considering this I project Marathons Q3 pretax income at 467B or 37B after taxes 21 historically The company usually has 350M in income attributable to noncontrolling interests giving a final net income estimate of 335B or an EPS of 838 This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at 748For Q4 based on current prices its EBITDA outlook is  lower at 142B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month That equates to an estimated pretax income of 448M or 353 after tax and almost zero after noncontrolling interest 4M or a 001 EPS The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at 453 EPS however those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downsideThese estimates do not account for oneoff costs gains or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathons volumes will also remain constant With hurricane season in full swing refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels Further the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index Ive used The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA however it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to 75 and a Q4 nearer to 1On Monday morning both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 34 indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand As mentioned in my  the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies Potentially the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor See belowEV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1 that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive Further the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower See belowAgain a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread In my previous article regarding Marathon my longterm view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade and today in particular would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil contributing to a permanently higher crack spread Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains partially due In the long run I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline leading to higher crack spreads However the shortterm situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to  Further the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasonsGasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut However oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release Of course no more reserves will come out of the SPR which has lost around half its previous storage levels See belowWe must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues Currently it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate and most lack the information relevant to make that determination Still if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur This potential  exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves both strategic and commercial could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel considering it is  Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time Still gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices mainly if it is already falling with the economy todayThe US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC production cuts offsetting the recovery in US oil production That said the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last See belowAs the rig count declines future oil supplies should trend lower That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline Further a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies potentially harming Marathons steadier income streamAt this point it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count Further should global oil supplies decline enough the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market That said I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon I believe oils bullish case has become much stronger while gasoline is not nearly as solid pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spreadAt todays commodity prices I believe Marathons EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels In the long run I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil However in the short term I believe MPC has ample 12month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinerymargin profit decline shockLooking forward I expect MPCs Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer However from Q4 I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread In my view depending on how the oil markets situation changes an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies For this reason I am bearish on MPC on a 12month outlook basis Its EPS may be around 1 to 2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward PE of 30XI rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable I still like the stock from a longterm perspective but not at its current price given the immediate profit decline To me the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war  global recession causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer If MPC operates in a highly sensitive  environment today it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world Thus if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years as Ive expected its longterm potential would also be minimal   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is

80,Tesla: Weighing The Bullish Prospects Against The Bearish Challenges Of Its Future,  has always been a company that has piqued myHowever like any highprofile stock Ive observed that opinions on TSLAs future prospects can be quite polarized In this analysis Ill share my insights into both the bullish and bearish cases for TSLA supported by recent data One of the standout metrics for Tesla is Profit margins are a testament to a companys operational efficiency Teslas profit margins have been on an uptrend as depicted in the chart below This trend underscores Teslas ability to manage costs effectively while scaling its operations Financial analysts opinions are something I always consider Tesla has a commendable history of surpassing these earnings estimates In the last quarter the company reported an EPS of 091 outperforming the estimate of 082 by a notable 1098 The broader financial communitys sentiment is also worth noting  have turned bullish on TSLA as depicted in the pie chart below which gives a visual representation of the current analyst ratings for the stock An operating margin indicates how much profit a company makes from its core business operations Teslas operating margin for the trailing twelve months stands at 1346 showcasing its ability to efficiently convert sales into profit Considering the automotive industrys average operating margin typically ranges between 5 to 10 Tesla is doing relatively well ROE is a measure of a companys profitability concerning shareholders equity With an ROE of 2714 for the trailing twelve months compared to the average ROE for the automotive industry which usually hovers around 10 to 15 Tesla has demonstrated its prowess in generating profits and providing value to its shareholders While Im impressed with Teslas achievements its current PE ratio of 7087 does raise eyebrows This ratio is significantly higher than the industry average suggesting potential overvaluation Incidentally the industry average PE ratio for the automotive sector as a whole typically ranges between 15 to 20 Market sentiment is crucial The latest data reveals a substantial 8472 million shares of TSLA sold short This significant short interest indicates that a portion of the market is betting against the stock Bill Gates Im looking at you sir Day traders tend to love trading this stock because TSLAs stock price can swing quite dramatically With a beta of 20892 its quite evident that TSLA is more volatile than the broader market Financial leverage is always a concern While Tesla has a commendable cash reserve its debt levels cant be ignored The companys short and longterm debt stands at 218 billion which could impact its future flexibilityWhile my main expertise lies in algorithmic trading software engineering I also wear the hat of a licensed Commodity Trading Advisor I believe that each sector within the SP 500  to different extents reflects the commodity market This encompasses everything from energy commodities like oil to precious metals agricultural products and even soft commodities Their price movements can cast a ripple effect on the broader market landscapeWith respect to oil  its price fluctuations can have a noticeable impact on the SP 500 index for several reasons Crude oil is a good gauge of global economic vitality Elevated oil prices often hint at robust global demand and economic expansion whereas depressed prices suggest the contrary Given that the SP 500 encapsulates the performance of US largecap stocks shifts in global economic sentiments hinted by oil prices can sway the index Oil prices are pivotal in shaping inflation trends A surge in oil prices escalates the cost of energy transit and commodities which subsequently drives up inflation Rising inflation might influence interest rates This in turn can modify the discount rate used for valuing stocks possibly dragging down stock valuations and subsequently the SP 500 index Fluctuations in crude oil prices determine gas prices at the pump When oil prices climb gasoline becomes pricier which might suppress discretionary spending on other products and services Given that consumer expenditure is a cornerstone of the US economy any pullback could dent the performance of firms listed in the SP 500 Price volatility in the oil sector can seed doubts among investors Dramatic price shifts can spur market volatility potentially shaking investor confidence and by extension the SP 500 indexNow zooming in on Tesla a key player in the SP 500 any movement in the index influenced by oil or other factors could have implications for Teslas stock price Especially given Teslas positioning in the electric vehicle sector shifts in oil prices and the subsequent effects on traditional automotive companies in the SP 500 might lead investors to make comparative judgments about Teslas future prospects in relation to oil trends I will expand on this below High oil prices can drive interest towards electric vehicles as they are seen as a more economical alternative when gasoline prices rise The oil price shock of 2022 for instance led to increased interest in EVs according to a report by   With a market cap of over 800 billion Tesla is the largest EV manufacturer in the world The economic appeal of Tesla vehicles compared to gasolinepowered vehicles can be influenced by oil prices For instance when oil prices were high around 2011 owning a Tesla was not only ecologically sensible but also economically sensible in regions like Belgium due to lower electricity costs However when oil prices dropped significantly by 2016 the cost of charging an electric vehicle in Europe approached the cost of filling a gasoline tank which might affect the sales appeal of EVs  The stock price of Tesla can be affected by oil price changes For example Tesla shares  on Monday March 92020 when it shed nearly 100 to close at 608 per share dropping 6 percentage points more than the SP 500 did for the day demonstrating significant relevant weakness to the market when oil prices had plummeted over 20 Conversely high gasoline prices driven by high oil prices have led to a surge in Tesla orders in the US as more people look towards electric vehicles as a more costeffective alternative In fact it was almost exactly two years since that near 100 drop in Tesla price when on March 10 2022  ran an article with this headline Tesla TSLA order rate is surging in the US as gas prices are turning people toward electric cars  Analysts have also projected that higher oil prices could potentially lead to a surge in Teslas stock as higher oil prices might drive higher sales of electric vehicles including Teslas  The violent geopolitical environment in the world today will continue to have a significant impact on the exorbitant price of oilTesla is continually improving its FSD technology The latest versions 1144 and 11472 are still in Beta and mainly available in North America The rest of the world must wait until regulatory challenges and global public sentiment are addressedTesla had announced at their  on September 30th 2022 an aspiration to make FSD available worldwide by the end of 2022 However achieving this goal by the end of 2023 or even 2024 appears increasingly unlikely The pinnacle achievement would be reaching Level 5 autonomy where the car is truly fully autonomous This milestone would lead to cost savings for Tesla and could make the car more affordable for consumers At this stage vehicles wouldnt require steering wheels pedals gear shifts or siderearview mirrors Yet Level 5 autonomy remains a distant goalThe EV market is witnessing heightened competition with traditional automakers and new entrants striving to gain market share Particularly noteworthy is the rivalry between Tesla and BYD Company Limited  While Tesla has been leading in the EV space especially in North America the scenario is shifting with BYD emerging as a formidable competitor especially in ChinaRecent sales data from Q3 2023 showed that Tesla delivered 435059 pure electric cars with BYD closely trailing at 431603 sales marking a narrow sales gap of 3456 units This trend might see BYD surpassing Tesla in the near future especially given BYDs impressive yearonyear sales growth of 669 compared to Teslas quartertoquarter dip of 67Both companies have global ambitions illustrated by their investments in worldwide facilities While Tesla is eyeing a new factory in Mexico BYD is also expanding its footprint globally with facilities in China and substantial investments in countries like Uzbekistan Thailand and Brazil and is making an aggressive entry into the Mexican market BYDs diverse offerings like the recently unveiled DOLPHIN and its broader technological background spanning various sectors underline its competitive edgeThis competition symbolizes a larger momentum in the global shift towards sustainable transportation and suggests that the EV market crown is indeed up for grabs making the landscape more dynamic and less monopolisticThe competitive landscape extends to other players like Lucid Group  Rivian  Fords  Mustang MachE and the Volkswagen  ID4 each bringing unique offerings and innovations to the table further intensifying the competition Tesla faces in maintaining its market dominanceMoreover key players in OPEC realizing the imminent threat posed by EVs to their market share have also begun to venture into the electric vehicle domain Following the ethos of if you cant beat them join them Saudi Arabia for instance is developing its own brand of electric vehicles Ceer and has set an ambitious target to install 50000 domestic EV charging stations by 2025 Adding to this Saudi Arabias Ministry of Investment has inked a 56 billion deal with Human Horizons a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer On a similar note the UAE has acquired a 7 stake in NIO  a wellestablished electric car company based in Shanghai indicating a strategic shift towards embracing EV technologyThe impact of competition within the electric vehicle industry is largely contingent upon the prevailing circumstances If we zoom out a broader perspective on the EV market reveals a sector in a state of flux According to the International Energy Agency IEA data from 2022 reveals a stark disparity with 95 of global automotive vehicles still reliant on gasoline juxtaposed against a mere 5 harnessing electric power encompassing both battery electric vehicles BEVs and plugin hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs The IEA holds an optimistic outlook on the proliferation of electric vehicles projecting a substantial uptick to 30 by 2030 further escalating to 50 by 2040 This trajectory delineates a substantial market share awaiting capture highlighting the potential for an influx of contenders to flourish within this burgeoning sector For Tesla to capture even a third of the market share would be hugeHowever the competitive dynamics could take a bearish turn under certain scenarios For instance should a contender in the mold of Tesla like BYD attain a technological advantage enabling cost leadership and economies of scale the subsequent accelerated production scale and lower price points for their EVsmaintained without any compromise on qualitycould pose a significant threat to Teslas market standing Moreover geopolitical factors could further intensify the competition if say the Chinese government extends a helping hand to BYD in navigating regulatory mazes while Tesla finds no such favor in North America the repercussions could be swift and severe for Tesla This hypothetical scenario showcases how competition while fostering innovation and consumer choice can also precipitate market realignments that may be unfavorable for Tesla Analysts  that Teslas earnings will grow by approximately 4082 in the coming year increasing from 294 to 414 per share  However there are differing  on Teslas fullyear earnings with estimates ranging from 272 to 329 per share  Theres a notable decline in  towards Tesla mainly due to its recent Q3 deliveries falling short of Q2 which was down by 7 The stock has been fairly volatile over the past month and despite some growth in early September it has been trending downward Analysts from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have issued bearish takes on Tesla with Ryan Brickman of JPMorgan reiterating a sell rating and a price target of 135 while Goldman Sachs Mark Delaney lowered his price target to 252 and rated the stock as a hold  Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein expressed concerns over Teslas auto gross margins expecting potential downside due to lower volumes and significant discounts on cars sold from inventory Theres a prediction that Tesla would need to cut prices further next year to drive volumes which would impact margins  Several analysts have lowered their price targets for Tesla stock For instance William Stein of Truist Financial lowered his TSLA stock price target to 243 maintaining a hold rating Despite these concerns Tesla stock maintains its status as a moderate buy consensus on  with 12 Wall Street analysts rating it as a buy and 12 rating it as a hold while four analysts maintain sell ratings  Due to the missed forecasts on Q3 deliveries analysts have less reason to be optimistic about Tesla stock contributing to uncertainty as investors wait to learn how Tesla performed in Q3 To gauge the potential future price range of Teslas stock its insightful to delve into key metrics market indicators and tools that can aid in monitoring and analyzing price movements Below are the relevant data points derived expectations and some recommendations for monitoring critical price levelsThe effectiveness and suitability of the aboveanalyzed strategies and indicators largely depend on individual investment goals and timeframesIn my view Teslas journey is filled with both opportunities and challenges Its growth metrics and market leadership are indeed commendable Furthermore Elons impact as a CEO is unparalleled in contemporary times Yet concerns such as high valuation and significant short interest remain pressing The looming question also persists What would Teslas trajectory be if Elon were to step away one dayI believe that anyone looking at Tesla Inc should approach it with a balanced perspective weighing both its strengths and potential risks As always thorough research and understanding ones risk tolerance are crucial before making any investment decisions Happy

82,Suncor Energy: Oil Prices Spiking As This 4.5% Yield Beast Becomes A Buy,Editors note Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome WA Research as a new contributor Its easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium Offering a doubledigit upside potential as my price target sits above 42 per share investing in Suncor Energy  stock seems like an obvious choice currently The average 5year net income growth has been 647 and the dividend growth during the same period is 733 The management is moving the company into a phase where its leveraging its solidified asset base and distributing large sums of earnings to shareholders The price indicates a 235 upside at the moment and with market sentiment somewhat mixed the light is shining on the buyers right nowSU is strategically positioned to harness the potential for an imminent oil price surge over the next few months Moreover the company is wellprepared for the longterm challenges posed by a world where economically viable global oil reserves are becoming increasingly scarce SU boasts one of the industrys most impressive reserve life ratios emphasizing its strong foothold in ensuring a sustainable and robust energy futureEven with the push towards renewables the production levels of SU have been growing very well on a YoY basis up to 814 mbblsd as of Q2 FY2023 Utilization rates have also been increasing and sit at 85 The price of crude oil has increased substantially in the last few months and sits at over 87 In 2022 the oil prices  at 100 for the year Should we see a rapid increase here it seems likely that we will see a rapid increase in the share price as well for SU to display optimism for future earnings But I do think there is a case to be made here as well that SU can provide a strong dividendpaying opportunity for a portfolio SU has the qualities I seek right now like strong margins and further utilization rate of the assets as the top line has appreciated faster than total assets Seeing as the management is already growing production levels I think this is indicative of their positive view on the market conditionsTo underscore the companys current trajectory to grow its production levels it seems they are impressively increasing economic investment capital For 2023  sees a total investment and sustainment  maintenance capital rate of 54  58 billion Since 2020 the capital expenditures have increased to 42 billion but sit below where it was back in 2017 That year had expenditures of 52 billion and it seems we are heading back there too Revenues that year were 25 billion which SU has surpassed by a long shot this year and last too The reason I am bringing this up is to highlight the improved efficiency of the business and its capability to limit expenditures whilst also quickly raising the bottom lineWith SU you are getting a solid dividend payer as the yield inches above 45 currently The longterm outlook as we have discussed is positive for the company as necessities like oil and gas are going to be persistent My argument for this lies in that the sheer cost and amount of resources needed for transitioning fully to an energy renewables society is just not going to happen in a few years its a slow and steady transitionThe market seems quite positive on the business right now with SA analysts and Wall Street both rating it a buy I fall in the same camp as the fantastic margins of the business has made it a winner in my bookThe chart indicates very well the relationship between the share price and the net margins of the business During 2020 we saw a steep decline as oil prices plummeted It has recovered very well since but did cause SU to have a negative NI margin of over 15 Oil prices averaged 41 that year and the company  41 billion in EBT Including unusual items which pushed earnings down I think SU stands in a better position these days than in 2020 as interest expenses have declined to 610 million TTM a result of impressive  of over 6 billion since then 4 billion in 2022 and 21 billion in 2021 There seems to be a consensus that rates will stay  for a longer time I find it likely that interest expenses of over 600 million TTM is likely for SU even if they pay down large amounts of debt as refinancing may be done at higher rates Below we will get into more of the price targets I have for the company but in short I see the outlook for oil and gas as very positive and the forecasted price target I have for SU indicates a 23 upside potential currentlyLast  showcases a net earnings decline of over 2 billion from Q2 FY2022 results This has been the result of softer commodity prices Its important to remember though that volatility is to be expected in this industry as we have seen above In times of strong oil prices the distributable cash flows for SU increase and so does quite often the optimism from the market causing the share price to appreciate in value But then of course in times of lower oil prices the SU dividend prospects somewhat decrease but over time I think will average outThe returns to shareholders have still been quite positive though sitting at 13 billion still down from 32 billion a year prior I think its important to realize that the increase in shareholder returns largely came from increased buybacks The dividends have been growing steadily over the years and are higher than in 2022 averaging a 5year annual growth of 733 What I am looking more at though is the repayments of debt that SU has focused on declining over 1 billion since December 31 2022 Whilst other companies have been largely affected by higher interest rates SU has not seen the same rise as prioritizing debt repayments has been maintained The oil sands  of the company have still been very positive on the business as it was over 15 billion last quarter and 32 billion YTD Capital expenditures for the assets have grown and the inflated oil prices the previous years quarter offered inflated the FCF too I dont expect similar numbers for either Q3 or Q4 but a slight increase in both capital expenditures and FCF I see as likely In most years the price of oil prices rallies somewhat into the colder months of the year which supports the previous statements about raised FCF in the coming quarters As a final price I want to include the positive work SU has done on its cash position which is the highest since 2017 at over 19 billion This amount is capable of covering over 10 of the debt position which I factor as a strong position and is one of the several arguments I have for a slight premium valuation and buy caseOn the overview of productions and operating costs I think SU is in a good position right now The company remains profitable at 30  33 bbl for the oil sands operations This is also the largest site for productions anticipated to generate 385000  425000 for 2023 The Syncrude operations are the least profitable at 39  43 per barrel The guidance indicates strong refinery utilization rates at 92  96 and with the low threshold for strong profits SU will likely post strong earnings for 2023There are some planned maintenance for 2023 and this will impact the quarterly mbpd with Base Plant U2 at the largest 65 and 70 in Q3 and Q4 respectively Should it be revealed that impacts may be prolonged or maintenance behind schedule I think we should anticipate a slight dip in the share price but something that likely will be shortlivedAbove we have the current price targets for SU ranging from 5099 to 3588 with an average of 3961 This average is under my price target of 42 which I justify by the fact SU has made implied improvements in the last few years like significant debt repayments which have limited the impacts of higher interest rates The interest expenses are far below that of a few years ago and have enabled strong returns to be sustainable for shareholders At a share price of 42 SU trades at an earnings multiple of 1079 given current 2023 predictions of 389 The 1079 pe is above where SU has been  which is 1052 But as I said SU is in a better position today than in 2020 and has as a result grown into a premium valuation The 42 target implies roughly a 23 upside from todays levels an immediate upside far outperforming that of broader market indexes enabling a buy to be made hereOver the short term the oil market remains highly vulnerable to substantial price fluctuations largely influenced by the dynamic geopolitical landscape Notably elevated oil prices can evolve from economic matters to political challenges potentially involving government actions such as tax policy modifications and trade regulations all of which can introduce an element of unpredictability into SUs nearterm financial prospects The intricacies of managing this multifaceted energy market underline the intricate nature of the industryWe have seen negative oil prices affect companies in the industry previously During 2020 which was a surprising year the price of oil declined heavily and so did many oil companies But what has been proven is a certain resilience in businesses like SU as shareholder returns continued with dividends and buybacks amounting to over 15 billion Shortterm volatility is a risk with companies like SU but I dont think its an adequate risk that trumps the prospects of making it a longterm positionMy target of 42 is within reach as SU is growing its assets and paying back debt efficiently The impact of higher interest rates has been limited and I think as they decline SU will post even higher EPS results The upside is over 23 and recent spikes in oil imply that Q3 and Q4 may showcase strong NI YoY growth as production levels remain high The 45 dividend is a solid addition to the buy case as well one that seems sustainable as well given the positive  for traditional energy sources like crude oil   Past performance is no guarantee of future

84,Cautiously Bullish Oil,For the most part indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish  as they have been for much of this yearOn the term structure front both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports reduced production of Saudi heavysour crudes which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline and a number of other factors the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardationMeanwhile WTI calendar spreads represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole The EIAs historically noisy estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen Regardless the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at presentWe can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above as well as looking at refined product crack spreads As we can see below gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firmClearly the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand sideSuch dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline or to reduce runs thus reducing the amount of crude they consume This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market After all refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oilThus all else equal unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the 95100 area in the near future particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lowerThough as we have seen outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic with the DubaiBrent spread a proxy for AsiaChina oil demand continuing to trend lower overall and near parityWhile the various AfricaBrent crude oil differentials also remain strong This is an important relationship to track as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell offWhile the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September Indeed if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages the picture has now turned unfavourable as we are seeing far more builds than drawsIn terms of commercial inventory levels overall total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages as do diesel stocks The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present For me to once again become uber bullish though I remain cautiously bullish persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the normIn terms of the outlook for supply and demand consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4 though to a lesser extent prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024 Although such forecasts are full of assumptions and thus fraught with error it is worth noting what the EIA IEA OPEC and others are expecting in terms of production and consumption For now consensus is expecting a 051 mbd deficit to close out the year which if true will show up in persistent inventory drawdowns as well as the key indicators of the physical market which to me are far more reliable indicators of the outlook for oil When it comes to positioning this is unfortunately where things take a bearish turnAll good bull markets in energy are driven by low levels of speculative positioning ie hedge funds and CTAs who are then forced to cover shorts and drive prices higher on the back of favourable fundamentals This is exactly what has occurred since speculators were caught heavily underweight crude oil around midyear thus providing the fuel for much of the subsequent rally from 70 to 95 crudeNow despite a significant level of unwinding of speculative longs in RBOB gasoline and ultras low sulfur diesel ULSD futures hedge funds and CTAs remain heavily long WTI futures a dynamic which will prove a material headwind for oil This is not to say speculative positioning cannot become even more extended but the fundamentals need to be significantly bullish for them to do soFrom a technical perspective however it is difficult to argue that recent price action remains favourable for bulls We continue to see a trend of higher highs and higher lows with the 9092 level now acting as key resistance Should we fail once again to break through this level then I suspect this is the market telling us how high the ceiling is for oil prices for the time being But as it stands price action remains constructive and a break above 92 for WTI should usher in 100 crude in short orderThe same can be said of the energy equities with the XLE ETF  continuing its relative strength and very much looking like it wants to break out above the 93 level which has acted as key resistance for over 12 months now Again a decisive break to the upside would be telling in relation to the future movements in the energy spaceOn the other hand it is also worth noting we are now entering the worst seasonal period for oil prices in the final few months of the year The Northern Hemispheres summer driving season is behind us although it must be said seasonal swings in demand have had very little impact on price movements

89,"Strathcona Resources Acquiring Pipestone Energy, Creating A Possible Top-5 Canadian Oil Producer",On August 1 2023   that it had reached an agreement to be acquired by the private company Strathcona Resources LtdPipestone is a  natural gas producer in  in Canada TheA number of questions arose from the transaction What kind of company is Strathcona anyway Is Strathcona worthy of an investment and how to make an entry What should the existing Pipestone shareholders do nowStrathcona is a portfolio company of Waterous Energy Fund From 2017 toAs a result of those acquisitions Strathcona Resources has emerged as one of the largest privateequity owned EP companies in North America Strathcona operates a diversified portfolio of assets in Canada in three core areas including the Cold Lake oil sands play the Lloydminster heavy oil play and the Montney natural gas play as shown in Figure 2Prior to the announcement of the Pipestone transaction Strathcona guided toward producing 148000 54000 boed in 2023 Figure 3 with the output consisting of 85 of liquids and 15 natural gas From 2016 to the end of 2023 without considering Pipestone Strathcona will have grown production at an impressive CAGR of 627 through acquisitions and organicallyFollowing the allshare acquisition the newly formed corporation will continue as Strathcona Resources Ltd Once the transaction is completed the existing Pipestone shareholders will receive approximately 905 of the pro forma equity in the new Strathcona Resources on a fullydiluted basis or around 887 on a basic basis In other words every Pipestone share will exchange into 0067967 new Strathcona shares as detailed in Figure 4 and Figure 5The above exchange ratio implies an initial market capitalization of C86 billion or an initial enterprise value of C115 billion once the C29 billion in pro forma debt outstanding on closing of the transaction is consideredIt is worth noting that the agreed transaction terms do not include any premium over the close price on July 31 2023 the day before the announcement of the deal for Pipestone shareholders However it is possible that some may have gotten wind of an upcoming transaction and caused the share price to surge on July 31 2023 If that is the case using last Fridays close as a reference point the agreed terms may actually include an 119 premium which evaporated entirely on August 1 2023 as illustrated in Figure 6With this transaction Strathcona Resources further strengthens its exposure to the Montney natural gas play and increases condensaterich Montney production which provides a natural hedge to its operations in the Cold Lake oil sands and Lloydminster heavy oil plays After 65 years of building up the business as a private entity Strathcona will finally become a publiclytraded company as the oil bull market continues to swing higherPipestone Energy on the other hand has struggled to attract institutional investors due to its humble size even though it had grown production from 152 boed to 35162 boed in four years By joining forces with Strathcona to create the fifth largest liquids producer in Canada Pipestone shareholders will likely benefit from an inflow of institutional money and consequently share price appreciationSome Pipestone investors might have hoped for a larger premium that would allow for a quick gain upon exiting However Strathcona probably thought that it would get sufficient shareholder support anyway Importantly from Strathconas perspective offering a seat on the bus to years of production growth managed by a highlyregarded management team that consists of Executive Chairman Adam Waterous CEO and President Rob Morgan and CFO Connor Waterous as well as the potential for substantial capital appreciation outweighs catering to a few shortterm swing tradersOnce the transaction is completed by 4Q2023 Strathcona will have a diversified portfolio of assets that includes Cold Lake thermal oil 55000 bbld Lloydminster heavy oil 55000 bbld and Montney natural gas 75000 boed These assets combined will be capable of producing 185000 boed with 70 being oil 8 condensate and 22 natural gas At 185000 boed Strathcona will be trailing liquidsweighted producers Canadian Natural Resources  Cenovus Energy  Suncor Energy  and Imperial Oil  but will be ahead of MEG Energy  in terms of total productionThe new Strathcona Resources will have 1500 MMboe of proved reserves and 2591 MMboe of proved and probable reserves supporting a 1P reserve life of 222 years and a 2P reserve life of 384 years as shown in Figure 7Backed by its ample reserves Strathcona Resources envisions a future of aggressive organic growth Over the next eight years the company aims to increase production to 220000 boed using its existing facilitys capacity With debottlenecking projects and brownfield expansions that figure is set to rise to 285000 boed Furthermore by developing greenfield areas Strathcona may grow production to 325000 boed reflecting a robust CAGR of 73 as depicted in Figure 3Its worth noting that additional acquisitions have the potential to accelerate this already promising growth trajectorySeveral factors are poised to drive Strathconas profit marginStrathcona is confident that its fullcycle breakeven will be less than US40bo WTIAccording to my estimate Strathcona Resources is valued at an EVEBITDA of 30X immediately after completing the transaction and it is valued at 28X of 2024 EBITDA Given that it is an oil producer with a projected 73 annual production growth during an unfolding upcycle Strathcona appears undervalued compared to above industry peers which capture an average EVEBITDA of 56X Furthermore Strathconas undervaluation is evident from its valuation metrics of US575boe for proved reserves and US333boe for proved and probable reservesIn my view purchasing Pipestone while impatient retail speculators head for the exit Figure 6 presents an excellent opportunity for longterm investors to establish a position in Strathcona ResourcesThere are a slew of risks associated with the newlyformed Strathcona Resources The market will need time to learn about the management and the Strathcona story Moreover Waterous Energy Fund and its employees will own 9095 of the new Strathcona Resources Their more than 195 million shares could potentially overhang capital appreciation if unloaded without constraint However Strathcona management has indicated that they do not plan to sell a significant number of shares anytime soon It is possible that the Waterous family may offload part of their shares in large blocks to various institutions for example for index purposesThe acquisition of Pipestone Energy by Strathcona will create a publiclytraded largecap oil producer in Canada The new Strathcona Resources offers a compelling story of aggressive growth and highmargin profitability Based on available information the transaction appears to undervalue the new Strathcona Resources leaving a significant upside for early investors including those who choose to retain their positions in PipestoneEditors Note This article discusses

93,Better High Yield Buy: Enterprise Products Partners Or Energy Transfer?,Energy Transfer  and Enterprise Products Partners  are some of the most popular midstream stocks on Seeking Alpha and for good reason Both offerIn the past we have held both of these securities but since launching our portfolio in December 2020 we have greatly preferred and outsized ET given its much cheaper valuation That move has paid off tremendously as ET has delivered phenomenal total returns that have significantly outpaced EPDs over that period of timeEPD is often considered to have a better business model than ET has especially when factoring in management After all EPDs returns on invested capital have consistently outpaced ETs by several hundred basis points over the yearsMoreover EPD boasts a quarter century track record of growing its distribution each year whereas ET halved its distribution three years agoAs a result it may come as a bit of a surprise to find that ET has actually outperformed EPD over the period of time that they both have been publicly tradedThat being said lets look at the underlying asset portfolios of each of these MLPsEPD boasts a highly diversified portfolio of assets spread across a broad geographical footprint It also benefits from economies of scale with an enterprise value of nearly 87 billion This scale and diversification give EPD numerous avenues for lucrative investments in organic growth projects and potential acquisitionsEPD provides midstream energy services to both natural gas and natural gas liquids producers and consumers as well as those in the crude oil petrochemical and refined products industries The company is structured into four distinct segments NGL Pipelines  Services Crude Oil Pipelines  Services Natural Gas Pipelines  Services and Petrochemical  Refined Products ServicesWithin the NGL Pipelines  Services segment Enterprise offers natural gas processing services and related NGL marketing services They operate natural gas processing facilities in various locations including Colorado Louisiana Mississippi New Mexico Texas and Wyoming Additionally this segment manages NGL pipelines NGL fractionation facilities storage facilities for NGLs and related products and NGL marine terminalsThe Crude Oil Pipelines  Services segment handles the operation of crude oil pipelines and storage facilities including a fleet of 245 tractortrailer tank trucks used for crude oil transportation This segment is also involved in crude oil marketing activitiesThe Natural Gas Pipelines  Services segment focuses on operating natural gas pipeline systems for the gathering treatment and transportation of natural gas It also leases underground salt dome natural gas storage facilities in Napoleonville Louisiana owns an underground salt dome storage cavern in Wharton County Texas and engages in natural gas marketingIn the Petrochemical  Refined Products Services segment EPD operates facilities for propylene fractionation butane isomerization deisobutanizer operations octane enhancement and high purity isobutylene production This segment is also responsible for managing refined products pipelines and terminals ethylene export terminals and provides services related to refined products marketing and marine transportationET meanwhile also has a very diverse and geographically well distributed portfolio of midstream infrastructure assets and businesses It also has enormous scale and is in fact even larger than EPD with a nearly 106 billion enterprise valueET owns and operates around 11600 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines five natural gas storage facilities in Texas and Oklahoma and 19945 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines Furthermore ET manages natural gas gathering natural gas liquid pipelines processing plants and treatment facilities across multiple states including Texas New Mexico West Virginia Pennsylvania Ohio Oklahoma Arkansas Kansas and Louisiana Additionally it oversees natural gas gathering systems and oil pipelines in South Texas a natural gas gathering system in Ohio and provides water transportation to natural gas producers in Pennsylvania ET also owns and operates approximately 5650 miles of NGL pipelines NGL fractionation facilities NGL storage facilities with a capacity of approximately 58 million barrels along with other NGL storage assets and terminals totaling about 25 million barrels in storage capacityET also has a track record of making fairly substantial acquisitions in an effort to accretively scale its business and strengthen its competitive positioning Most recently it announced that it would be acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners  which should be immediately accretive to DCF per unit upon closing be credit neutral drive future synergies to further enhance the DCF per unit accretion extend ETs value chain in key basins increase its exposure to feebased margin businesses and add additional longterm contracted assets with investment grade counterparties As the graphic below illustrates ETs portfolio is very large reaching the key basins across the United States while also benefiting significantly from the growth in LNG exportsBoth businesses also generate the vast majority of their income from commodity price resistant feebased contracts with ET generating 90 of its adjusted EBITDA from feebased contracts and 80 of EPDs adjusted EBITDA coming from feebased contracts This makes them very stable cash flow generators regardless of broader market conditions and explains why EPD in particular has been able to grow its distribution so consistently in the face of major economic downturns and oil price crashesA final important note is that EPD insiders own nearly onethird of their partnership while ET insiders own 11 of their partnership While EPDs insiders are even more aligned with unitholders than ET insiders are it suffices to say that both firms are closely aligned with unitholders especially because ETs founder and Executive Chairman  Kelcy Warren  holds the majority of his net worth in ET units and continues to buy more quite aggressively over time Moreover ETs two coCEOs are required to hold 6x their annual base salary in ET unitsWhen it comes to balance sheet EPD is the clear winner hereET has made significant progress in recent years on its balance sheet paying down billions of dollars in debt bringing the leverage ratio down to within managements target range of 40x45x and even earning a credit rating upgrade to BBB from SP Clearly ETs balance sheet is quite solid and in little risk of nearterm financial challengesThat being said EPD has also brought its leverage ratio down to 30x  one of the lowest marks in the entire industry  and earned a credit rating upgrade from SP this year to A which is the best credit rating in the entire midstream industry It also has 4 billion in total liquidity nearly enough to cover all maturities between now and 2027 Moreover its weighted average term to maturity of 197 years 82 of its debt matures in 10 years or more and 51 of its debt matures in 30 years or more and the fact that 967 of its debt is at fixed rates 46 weighted average interest rate means that it is set up to compound unitholder equity at high spreads to its cost of capital for decades to comeMoving forward both EPD and ET have attractive distribution outlooksFirst and foremost despite their hefty payouts both distributions look to be very safe Based on consensus analyst estimates ETs 2023 distributable cash flow is expected to cover its distribution by 195x while EPDs 2023 distributable cash flow is expected to cover its distribution by 174xThrough 2027 analysts expect ET to grow its distribution at a 43 CAGR which is inline with managements 35 CAGR guidance range Meanwhile analysts are guiding for a 5 CAGR in EPDs distribution in the coming years which is inline with managements recent distribution growth rate over the past few yearsWhile ETs coverage ratio is currently stronger than EPDs EPDs stronger balance sheet gives it more flexibility in returning capital to unitholders helping to drive its stronger anticipated growth rate in the coming years Moreover ETs management is likely going to be spending more aggressively on growth projects than EPD will be Given EPDs historically superior returns on invested capital relative to ETs this should not be a problem for them as they do not need to invest as much capital in order to generate similar growth rates as ETWhen it comes to valuation both stocks look undervalued right nowBoth ET and EPD trade at meaningful discounts to their historical average EVEBITDA ratios with both ET and EPD trading at a 74 discount to their respective historical EVEBITDA ratio ET meanwhile trades at a steep PDCF discount to EPD reflecting its substantially greater leverage as well as its lower EVEBITDA valuation As a result it is unsurprising to see it trading at a higher distribution yieldBoth of these midstream businesses are high quality operating well right now and enjoy strong balance sheets after several years of prudent deleveraging efforts as well as moves to improve distribution coverage ratios Both are also moving into a phase where steady distribution growth should be the normYet despite these obvious strengths and their defensive quality in a weakening economic environment they both continue to appear undervalued While ET offers the greatest total return potential given its greater leverage and cheaper valuation EPD has considerably less risk given its lower leverage higher credit rating and superior longterm returns on invested capitalOverall we like both of these midstream infrastructure businesses equally from a riskreward standpoint and rate them both Buys right now  Samuel Smith is Vice President of Leonberg Capital he has a diverse background that includes being lead analyst at several highly regarded

95,"Pick Your Own Crude Oil Price: Regardless, It's Heading Higher",Opinions defining the next direction for crude oil  pricing continues The bantering for position seems relentless Those claiming weakness watched with horror the price running against them The opposite was true a few months ago What seems clear and continues are three realIts clear a steep shortfall in production and refining exists From our last article  the rest of the summer the dearth of production only became more apparentThe average shortfall for the summer equaled almost a million barrels per day while production slowly increased from the low 12 million to near 13 million The average production of 125 million isnt even close to closing the gapLast week inventories increased but we suspect that its a oneweek flyer which sometimes happens with this dataThe obvious question is will it continue Will demand remain strong The multitude of opinions continueWhen continuing with the bullish side arguments include tight production capacity strong demand and one country attempting to control it all the obvious that demand in July hit a record of 1028 bpd This was stronger than most analysts expected The bank forecasts deficits of 18 million bpd in the 2nd half of 2023 and just under a million next yearThe price increases will interfere with the Feds challenge to control inflation The August number came in hot  and the core excluding food and energy at 37 both significantly higher than the month before On a personal note we wonder seriously wonder why the second number even matters For those of us on fixed income the bulk of our expenses are food and energyThe International Energy Agency IEA reported slightly higher numbers at 103 million bpd demand on a worldwide basis At these rates world inventories will drop by 2mbd in the 3rd and 4th quarters  estimates August demand slightly above June and at record levels This respected group expects 4th quarter Brent averages at 93 with highs during the quarter above 100 We agree more comes later with the financial chokehold on the North Sea In recent weeks world banks have met trying to foster support for badly needed investment Few takers are expected with most loans being targeted at new energy sourcesSaudi Arabia and Russia love the outcome Russia under production restrictions from the Ukrainian War and the Saudis with its meager 1 million production cut per day are the world with these minor cuts It really is that tight with what was once about gasoline demand now changing toward diesel Supplies of diesel remain ultra tight on a world scale Our own data shows gasoline range bound between 25 and 29 along the Gulf Coast But diesel prices in the same region increased a dollar during the September quarter driven by increases in demand The long traders are out in force It is driven primarily by low inventories at the time of the year when demand really picks up One analyst wrote Demand is expected to increase monthonmonth to November Howsham addedThe story doesnt end with the bulls The bears continue their loud noise Their argument resides around coming higher interest rates associated with the higher inflation noted above and from grave growth concerns in China With energy prices back on the rise and inflation following with it The question becomes what price does Saudi Arabia want Some argue that the price equals what the economic marketplace can stand something in the middle 80s We arent so sureInvestors can gain a handle on future prices through charts  shows a dark line at 90 a significantly important point of resistance or supportRecently prices broke above 90 signaling higher movements The next point of resistance is in the 105 to 115 range The chart strongly suggests prices above 100 We expect a price range in the 110115 before this move is overIn the spring and early summer traders banks and others dumped large lots of long contracts in order to cut interest payments Without this cushioning effect the result will be more volatilityOil is heading higher unless recessionary demand destruction pulls the rug out from under it something that hasnt yet appeared It might The idea that economics drives pricing believed by some seems off the mark to us The price in our experience drives itself For those holding investments in companies which move with oil in our view the upward move still has legs The party isnt over Order the junk food It is still in vogue We understand we could be wrong   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No

96,9% Return Yield At $90 Oil - Diamondback Is The Only FANG You Need,Oil is making a comeback  even faster than I expected Despite weak economic growth poor consumer health Chinese growth fears and a hawkish Fed WTI crude oil is back above 90Hence in recentCanadian Natural is one of my three largest oil holdings The other two are Pioneer Natural Resources  and Chevron  which I bought because of merger expectations when oil was still subdued  and because its a fantastic oil majorOne stock that readers keep bringing up is  a stock I have covered a number of times in the past The only reasonHowever I am considering buying it with the proceeds from a potential CVX sale at some point in the future After all FANG is one of my favorite oil companiesIn this article I wont just update my oil thesis after  the stock in July but I will also walk you through the updated bull thesis for FANG which consists of deep inventories very efficient operations that come with low breakeven prices a solid balance sheet and shareholderfriendly distribution plansI also expect that FANG will continue to do what it does best during bull markets outperform its peersSo without further ado lets dive into yet another upstream giant I loveAs usual I am starting these articles with an update on the oil situationRight now a lot of people are scratching their heads Why is oil so high if the economy is so badThe answer is because of supply Not only is US shale production running out of steam as I discussed in the aforementioned CNQ article and almost every oil article Ive written since 2020 but were also seeing OPEC production cutsOn top of that as  reports oil buyers worldwide are grappling with surging premiums for oil supplies marking some of the highest prices seen in months or even yearsThis spike in costs is a ripple effect of dwindling stockpiles at the largest US storage hub in Cushing Oklahoma The ramifications of this situation are working their way through international markets affecting Asia the Middle East and EuropeFurthermore export demand remains highIf we were in a situation we would likely see a rapid surge in US oil production However that is not happening nowAs reported by the  this reluctance to increase production is raising concerns about consumer fuel costs challenging the fight against inflation and posing new challenges for President Bidens upcoming 2024 election campaign which is going to be an uphill battle if the economy continues to develop like thisBidens unfavorable rating is quite significant despite low unemploymentGoing back to the Wall Street Journal article while some analysts predict oil prices may hit 100 a barrel soon American frackers are cautiousUnlike previous years when they flooded the market with crude to stabilize prices this time they seem to be holding back potentially keeping oil prices elevated until external factors impact production or demand subsidesIn the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas the most active oil field in the United States the number of drilling rigs for crude has declined by approximately 12 to 314 since the end of April even as US oil prices increased by around 13 a barrel during the same periodMost shale companies have committed to rewarding investors with share buybacks and dividends rather than rapidly increasing drilling efforts in response to inflation and elevated interest ratesCompanies are also protecting reserves as a lot of companies are running out of Tier 1 reserves Even the Permian is expected to see peak production in 4Q24FurthermoreWhile I do not rule out another oil price decline to the 75 to 80 area if economic growth weakens further my longerterm thesis remains unchangedI believe that rebounding economic growth in the future will more than likely lead to a situation of prolonged tripledigit dollar oil prices I do not believe in 200 to 300 oil but 100 to 130140 is definitely possibleThis brings me to Diamondback Energy which is one of the best places to be when betting on elevated oil prices  or just buying great longterm oil exposureFANG is an independent oil and natural gas company primarily focused on unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West TexasAs of December 31 2022 FANG held a substantial acreage position in the Permian Basin with approximately 615348 gross acresThe majority of this acreage is located in the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin known for their high concentration of oil and liquidsrich natural gasPlease note that the numbers in the overview below are NET acresThe estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of this date were approximately 2032971 MBOE with a significant portion being proved developed producing reservesThis gives the company at least 12 years worth of production at current rates excluding any future discoveriesFurthermore the company has substantial midstream pipelines and related investments It owns the General Partner of Viper Energy Partners LP  and 56 of the limited partner interestHaving said that theres a lot more to discussIn addition to having deep reserves and a welldiversified focus on Americas goto basin it also has toptier productionIn the second quarter of 2023 Diamondback Energy achieved volume outperformance with both oil and total production exceeding the high end of their respective guidance rangesNotably oil realizations stood at an impressive 97 of WTI pricing This strong performance was accompanied by a robust hedging program providing a vital insurance policy to mitigate downside risks and protect the dividendLooking ahead the company anticipated a 5 reduction in cash capital expenditures for the third quarter projecting a range of 650  700 million This reduction is attributed to lower well costs decreased drilling activity and a slower completion cadence For the fullyear 2023 the company set a revised cash capex guidance of 2600  2675 million reflecting a slight increase at the midpointAs some of these numbers may be vague let me give you a few other numbers that are very impressive FANGs operations are so efficient that it is able to protect its base dividend at 40 WTI This would protect free cash flow in the high30 WTI range making FANG one of North Americas most efficient drillersThe company also has a BBBrated balance sheet with zero maturities until 2026 It has a net leverage ratio of roughly 1x EBITDA and uses the proceeds of noncore asset sales for further debt reductionIm bringing this up because in combination with low breakevens the company is in a great spot to accelerate shareholder distributionsThanks to low debt levels debt reduction is NOT a capital priority of the companyIt has other priorities as seen in the overview below which also shows its hedges and breakeven pointSince 2018 the companys special dividends have roughly matched its base dividend Buybacks were larger than both of these items 2022 saw much higher special dividends than base dividends Special dividends even exceeded buybacks which is something I like as I prefer special dividendsTo give you an idea of how much FANG can distribute it made the free cash flow sensitivity chart belowPlease note that FANG is now trading 7 higher compared to the date when data was collected for this chart This means that expected returns at current levels are slightly lower The market cap used for these calculations was measured on July 28Having said that at 90 WTI the company is able to generate 1778 in FCF per share This translates to an FCF yield of 115 using the CURRENT market capstock price75 of that is 86In other words at 90 WTI investors can expect to get a total distribution yield of 86 Even at 70 WTI that number is still 67Furthermore one of the reasons Im buying energy on dips is the enhanced free cash flow If investors were to buy FANG after a 10 decline the distribution yield at 90 WTI would rise to 10When combining everything Ive said so far about FANG we get very fertile ground for outperformanceOver the past three years FANG has returned close to 470 including dividends This has beaten the Energy ETF  and SPDR SP Oil  Gas Exploration  Production ETF The company has been performing significantly better than its peers partly due to the poor performance of shale companies before the pandemic While I do not anticipate the company maintaining a consistent outperformance of nearly 200 points every three years I do believe that it will continue to outperform its competitors for many years to comeValuationwise I believe that energy companies are attractively valuedNot only is FANG in a great spot to distribute doubledigit dividends and buybacks but energy in general is still undervalued compared to the marketI believe that if the market starts to bet on an economic recovery and prolonged elevated energy prices we could see a massive flow into energy including FANGWhile its hard to put a price target on a stock that is highly correlated to a commodity I expect FANG to deliver strong doubledigit annual returns for as long as were in this favorable energy marketHence I continue to buy energy stocks on weakness Right now Im preparing for a potential oil price decline to 80 if the economy keeps weakening I have close to 20 energy exposureFANG has a major position in the Permian Basin deep reserves and efficient operations with low breakeven prices Their BBBrated balance sheet low debt levels and shareholderfriendly distribution plans make them a compelling choice for longterm oil exposureWith the potential for oil prices to remain elevated FANG offers an enticing combination of dividends buybacks and special dividends presenting investors with the prospect of substantial returnsIn a market where energy remains undervalued FANGs outlook is bright making it a top pick for those seeking strong returns and high income in the energy sectorJoin  today to get the most indepth research that

98,BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,How does BHP Group Limited  one of the largest diversified mining companies globally fit into an energy investment thesisDespite the exceptional 20212022 runup energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities  particularly among stocks withThat in a nutshell is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too However I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand Perhaps emerging economies like India INDA manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs  or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughsI personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities For example cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an environmentally conscious voter base In either case for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even netzero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this This naturally points to the mining industry as a hedge if oil gets phased out faster  and within mining BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resourcesBHPs mining portfolio has shifted over the years but after the  to Woodside  currently the group focuses on the If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker it has to consume a lot more of BHPs products at least in the next few decades to build out the new infrastructure that would support a lowcarbon economy Mining itself is very energy intensive so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels but lets assume thats only a shortterm effect and in the longrun net fossil fuel use will still dropBHP is certainly not the only miner out there but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand outBHPs yeartodate return is a negative 72 but lets be clear  the only reason for this years underperformance are fears over Chinas economy Yet the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors China sentiment may have bottomed The markets are also forward looking so commodity futures and BHPs stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving As much as China remains the main risk the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higherThe short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything The Tesla  in your garage only substitutes one type of nonrenewable resource for a different one Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply To the IEAs credit their  entitled Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions tried to quantify these exact megatrendsThe IEA distinguishes between a stated policies scenario STEPS associated with a slower energy transition and a sustainable development scenario or SDS which implies even faster decarbonization The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels by resource typeCopper demand of relevance to BHP is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x depending on how quickly the energy transition moves In 2020 the world  235 million metric tons or MT of copper so this is no small dealThe IEA explainsOn the production side the IEA warns of the forthcoming challenges my highlightsBeyond the electric grid solar power capacity will also be a demand driver per the IEAMaybe not as bullish for silver and silicon but copper is again the common denominatorWind power in turn will drive both copper and steel iron ore demand I recently  the woes of wind giant Ørsted which is exposed to the rising cost of materials And wind infrastructure requires a lot of materialGoing back to the IEAs projectionsMetallurgical coal itself isnt a direct input for electrification but indirectly steel production blast furnace still requires its useFinally nickel another of BHPs inputs is also a  for the energy transitionIn sum the energy transition guarantees the demand for BHPs outputs Lets examine next the supply sideDuring its 30 June 2023 financial year BHP produced the following quantitiesTo put these numbers into contextIn addition per BHPFor the June 23 year revenue and EBITDA were weighted towards iron oreHowever this can change quickly with the price of the underlying commodities Compared to Rio Tinto  and Vale  which are even more heavily weighted towards iron ore BHP is much better diversifiedWhile copper was only 30 of BHPs revenue BHP as noted is one of the largest producers globally and has a 575 stake in the largest copper mine globally These assets may prove quite valuable in a few years as  behind what is required for the energy transition For example copper producer Hudbay Minerals Inc  sees demand outpacing supply as early as 2025 The supply concerns are shared by SP which sees  despite high profits in the industry The causes according to SP include permitting and financing difficulties among othersEnergy transition advocates need to understand these realities Moreover just as with oil exploration capital underinvestment cant be undone quickly SPs research emphasizes the long lead times average of 23 years that it has taken historically to move from discovery to productionThe work on the Quellaveco mine owned by Anglo American  started in the 1960s By the way this is another reason to focus on a mature company like BHP and avoid junior miners who may be years away from attaining productionThe costs of incremental supply have also been trending up the  curve gets quite steep as you approach the 20 MT rangeNote that to BHPs advantage Escondida is one of the lowest cost assets out thereFinally I wanted to mention a chart from the wellknown  which suggests that inventories are also at multiyear lowsGR bring in the ESG dimension as another limiting factor for the industryTherein lies one of the ESG paradoxes too even though decarbonization is the number one ESG priority the ESG hurdles sabotage the energy transition by cutting access to the metals and minerals that are needed to make it happen However just as in the fossil fuel world this will hand the advantage to the owners of already developed assetsBHP produces iron ore and metallurgical coal but the ultimate driver for both is steel According to the Steel producer ArcelorMittal  is In particular steel inventories are lowJust as with copper much of the future steel demand will come from the According to CleanTechnica citing also an ArcelorMittal studyThis assessment is  by ArgusThe Inflation Reduction Act in the US is also expected to be big  for steelNickel is of smaller significance to BHP but its worth noting its also one of the key enablers for the energy transition The IEA study already discussed here expects 6070 of nickel demand by 2040 to be driven by clean energyAccording to the companyGiven even in the midst of the Covid pandemic copper held above 2lb BHPs primary assets look well positionedCopper is in contango due to nearterm demand weakness but the prices remain quite high historically and are way above BHPs breakeven costAccording to BHPThe main concern over iron ore currently is ChinaEven today with all the China negativity iron prices remain above BHPs breakevensInterestingly JPMorgan  r based on improved iron ore outlook in 2024Narrative can drive the price but the price itself is also a signal and it may suggest the worst for China is overIron ore prices have indeed come down a lot from 2021 but technically still look to be a in a multiyear bull market since 2016While shortterm metallurgical coal is facing some headwinds BHP is optimistic for the medium and longtermIt is the familiar theme  the demand will stay high but regulatory issues are hindering investment The major uncertainty in the shortterm is of course China Ironically in the long run the energy transition may again drive a preference for the specific grade of coal mined by BHPAustralian coking coal is down from the 2022 peak but is doing pretty well compared to the prepandemic yearsWhile Nickel is less important to BHP as a revenue driver BHPs nickel production is quite important for the energy transition According to the companyThe challenges appear limited to the neartermNickel prices are down from the recent highs but still well above the 20162020 lowsBHP is relatively undervalued compared to the broader sector at least focusing on enterprise value multiplesThe 58x EBITDA multiple is consistent with how the market has valued the company over the recent yearsTo be clear I dont necessarily expect the multiple to rerate higher but rather see the gains coming from higher EBITDA in the future as energy transition demand drives up the prices for BHPs outputsConveniently BHP provides in its filings a sensitivity table that shows how EBITDA would change with changes in the prices of the underlying commoditiesStarting off the forward EBITDA estimate of about 27 billion I show the implications for the stock if copper prices and iron increase back to their recent highs copper above 5lb and iron ore about 150tThe upside can be quite significant and I think BHP has good prospects of trading around 80 midpoint between the copper and iron ore scenarios by the end of next year This is about 40 upside and is more than what Wall Street projectsI am of course expecting that the underlying commodities will trade higher in a year compared to the futures curveThe main nearterm risk ahead of copper and iron ore is ChinaThe situation in China is obviously not good and the financial media coverage is as bad as it could be However at some point I think sooner rather than later the government in China will step up the stimulus measures and the economy will rebound They simply dont have another choice especially with the complicating geopoliticsOn the flipside commodities seem to be waiting for the slightest signal from Beijing to rally As reported by Seeking Alpha a In my view it is only a matter of time before we see further accommodative measures and copper and iron ore will react quicklyLongterm the bigger risk is that governments in the West realize that the energy transition project is too expensive and backtrack on their decarbonization pledges However as I am recommending BHP as a hedge within an energyoriented portfolio I am not really concerned about this possibilityLastly I want to highlight BHPs governance and dividend policy Mark Twain infamously defined a mine as a hole in the ground with a liar on top and it is indeed of utmost importance that managements incentives are aligned to the shareholders BHP has  corporate institutions to ensure transparency and the company is quite exemplary in terms of its public reporting including voluntary reports that arent mandated by regulators As one of the largest companies in Australia that also maintains listings in the UK US through ADRs and South Africa BHP is watched by many pairs of eyes This is likely true of other large mining groups too so the distinction I really want to make is from junior miners who are more likely to have higher governance risksBHP also has a robust dividend policy that mandates a minimum of 50 of net profit has to be paid as dividendsSeeking Alpha reports the forward dividend yield as 562 which compares well to the peer sectorFor BHPs 30 June 2022 year the yield was higher due to the special dividend which distributed the proceeds from the sale of the oil business However the regular yield of 56 is not bad either It is consistent with what you can earn on TBills so even if BHPs stock doesnt take off you are at least covering your opportunity costWhile my portfolio emphasizes energy stocks oil and gas there is always the possibility that decarbonization limits oil demand earlier than what energy bulls expect However for that to happen there must be a massive call on the metals and mining sector to supply the resources needed for the energy transition BHP as one of the largest diversified miners with lowcost resources offers a good hedge for the energy thesis Moreover even if you dont buy into the energy thesis BHP could be a good inflation hedge and also pays a dividend that covers the time value of moneyEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US

99,Occidental Petroleum: Warren Buffett And WTI Crude To The Rescue (Rating Upgrade),We previously covered   in June 2023 discussing the stocks uncertain prospects attributed to the decline in the crude oil spotThis had contributed to the stock prices decline below its critical support level previously supported by   average purchase price of 57s since March 2022We had been previously skeptical about whether Berkshires increasing stake in OXY had justified the highly buoyant stock prices from 30s to over 70s Accordingly we had rated the stock as a Hold Neutral then preferring to err on the side of cautionFor now it appears that Warren Buffett has come to OXYs rescue again by purchasing 214M shares at an average price of 5725 in June 2023 puttingThe recent price movement has also mirrored the recovery of WTI Crude Oil and Natural Gas spot prices both of which are important to OXYs average realized prices and eventually top bottom lineThanks to the  through 2023 and potentially through 2024 the commodities spot prices have recovered tremendously for the  by 169 to 7961 per barrel and for  by 204 to 253 per Mcf This is compared to the May 2023 bottom going against the previous downtrendThese spot prices are highly encouraging indeed higher by 81 compared to OXYs  of oil at 7359 per barrel and by 86 to the average realized gas price at 136 per McfThis is an important development since the producers  of 121K MBOED inline QoQ 61 YoY is split quite evenly between Crude Oil at 628 MBBLD 47 QoQ 27 YoY and Natural Gas Natural Gas Liquids at 590 MBOED 51 QoQ 10 YoYTherefore while OXYs FQ223 performance may have been underwhelming we expect things to improve in FQ323 and maybe even through FQ423 if the OPEC cuts are as restrictive as intendedThis is on top of the producers raised FY2023 production volume range to between 119M and 124M BOED up by 16 at the midpoint from the previous range between 1175M and 1215M BOEDThe higher crude oil prices above the minimum  may also trigger OXYs intensified redemption of  This is because the 8 annual dividend translates to an annualized payout  comprising 635 of its overall payout in FQ223We may also see intensified common share repurchases based on the  as of FQ223 with 369B already exercised over the last twelve months while retiring 595M of common sharesAs a result of these developments we believe that the producers deleveraging may continue taking a back seat though investors must also note that its longterm debts of 1908B inline QoQ 111 YoY in the latest quarter has already been drastically moderated compared to the peak levels of 4839B in FQ319These efforts demonstrate the OXY managements excellent use of the hyperpandemic windfall across  intensified capital expenditure for production growth balance sheet deleveraging and expanded shareholder returnsFor now OXYs valuations have also reflected Mr Markets optimism with NTM EV Revenues of 303x and NTM Market Cap FCF of 856x compared to its 1Y mean of 283x 660x and the oil gas sector median of 165x 798xHowever if we are to look at OXYs Enterprise Value to Proven Reserve ratio of 2188x based on its EV of 834B at the time of writing and the  of 381M barrels of oil equivalent BOE it is also apparent that OXY is still trading at a notable discountThis is compared to its US oil gas peers namely Exxon Mobils  Enterprise Value to Proven Reserve ratio of 251x Chevron  at 274x and Devon  at 2087xThese ratios are based on XOMs Enterprise Value of 44565B the  of 1774M BOE CVXs Enterprise Value of 30778B the  of 1122M BOE and DVNs Enterprise Value of 3778B the  of 181M BOESince the WTI crude oil spot prices remain elevated there are inherent risks that the OXY stock may eventually retrace once the Fed is successful in tamping down the inflation to 2 bringing the commoditys spot prices nearer to the prepandemic levels of 60sHowever we are cautiously confident that the OXY stock may retain its support levels at 57s attributed to Berkshires growing  to over 25 by the end of June 2023 despite  to acquire the companyBased on its annualized Free Cash Flow generation of 569B in the latest quarter the shares outstanding of 95880M and its NTM Market Cap FCF valuation of 856x the stock trades near to its current fair value of 5085 as wellDue to the attractive risk reward ratio we are cautiously upgrading our rating for the OXY stock to a Buy preferably between 57 and 60 in following Warren Buffetts cueLongterm investors may continue dripping as well depending on their dollar cost averages  The

100,18% Yield Potential At $100 Oil: Why Canadian Natural Is My Favorite Oil Play,Things are developing very quickly  even quicker than I expected Almost two monthsIn this article I want to take things a bit further As most of my readers will know Ive been bullish on oil for a while Energy is the secondlargest sector in my portfolio I mainly focus on companies that are able to deliver high returns at elevated oil prices for one major reason I want to protect my portfolio against prolonged aboveaverage inflationMy thesis is built on two major pillarsThese developments have caused a significant shift in geopolitical power and put a floor under inflation Inflation in the US is on the rise again driven by energy prices I expect this to hit core inflation as well over the next few monthsMeanwhile OPEC has witnessed an opportunity to use oil supply cuts to support prices After all with US shale growth losing momentum it can now impact prices much more efficientlyFor example even the Permian the only major basin in the US capable of significant oil price growth is now seeing lower output as declining legacy production is more than offsetting gains from new wells While these numbers can rebound rather quickly estimates are that the Permian will see longterm peak production in 4Q24 further putting a lid on US shale growthIt started when oil was close to 80 Now oil is north of 90 despite a significant decline in global economic growth expectationsAlthough I expect to deal with a number of oil price corrections along the way my thesis is that once global economic growth rebounds well have to deal with tripledigit dollar oil prices on a rather consistent basisSo when I invest in oil and gas companies I am looking for a number of key characteristicsIn this article Ill discuss recent developments that have caused oil prices to rally even faster than I expected This includes the demand pictureIll also elaborate on  which in my opinion is one of the best oil stocks money can buySo as we have a lot to discuss lets get to itOver the past few weeks it feels that the bullish oil trade has become mainstreamAccording to This is offering serious challenges for the Fed and the economy in general The  reported that market participants are now hoping that 100 oil wont do much damage as the risks of something bad happening to the economy are risingAccording to the paper the escalation of oil prices has raised concerns in both Washington and Wall Street about the potential disruption to the fueldependent American economyThis situation is reminiscent of past periods when surging oil prices played a role in pushing the country toward recessionThe chart below shows that elevated energy prices have often started recessionsAs oil prices approach 100 a barrel there are differing opinions on the potential outcomes While some expect prices to rise further due to supply constraints and geopolitical factors others anticipate moderation in prices due to increased US oil productionWhile oil production growth in the future can certainly keep oil prices from exploding we are dealing with a postpeak shale environment as I already briefly discussedFurthermore demand remains very strongBloombergs energy expert  just commented on the outlook of the International Energy Agency IEA which is renowned for its global energy statistics but has a track record of inaccurate forecasts according to BlasIn its upcoming World Energy Outlook report IEAs Executive Director Fatih Birol predicts a peak in coal oil and natural gas demand before 2030However history suggests these estimates may not holdNot only is an oil demand peak hard to predict but it is even more unlikely that a peak will be followed by a quick decline in demandAccording to Mr Blas historical consumption patterns particularly in coal and potentially in oil contradict the idea of a swift descent after reaching the peakFor instance coal demand assumed to have peaked in 2013 resurged in recent years highlighting the unpredictability of demand trajectoriesOn top of that OPEC expects to see oil demand growth until at least 2045I agree with that as I believe we have little understanding of what a growing middle class in India and rapidly expanding purchasing power in various African nations means for longterm oil demandGoing back to the IEA this is what Javier Blas wrote emphasis addedHaving said all of this I do not rule out an oil price decline to 80 again as poor economic growth could harm investors willingness to invest in cyclical assetsHowever the moment demand comes back I see no reason not to believe in a prolonged period of oil prices above 100This brings me to the star of this articleMy other favorite is Pioneer Natural Resources  which I recently covered in an article you can Canadian Natural Resources is currently my 6thlargest investment and one of my alltime favorites Im not just saying that to get catchy article titles but because I completely stand behind every bullish thing Ive ever said about the company behind the CNQ tickerFor starters the company has massive reserves CNQ is the only Canadian company with more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves The company has a 32year total proved reserve life index and more than 10 billion barrels in proved reservesOf these reserves 60 are highvalue synthetic crude oil light crude oil and natural gas liquids which tend to come with great marginsWith regard to production in the second quarter of 2023 Canadian Natural achieved a production of approximately 119 million barrels of oil equivalent per day BOEsd which included natural gas production at about 21 billion cubic feet per day and liquids production at approximately 847000 barrels per dayThese figures were impacted by various factors including wildfires in Western Canada thirdparty pipeline outages and planned turnaround activitiesThe wildfires caused temporary shutdowns of certain assets but production has been largely restoredThe company is also the secondlargest natural gas producerHaving said that a big part of the companys production comes from oil sands which is very different from conventional oil drilling This also has the massive benefit of no decline rates no reservoir risks and no reserve replacement risks The companys oil sand assets have a reserve life of more than 40 yearsIt is also much cheaper to maintain these operationsThe companys thermal  oil sands operations are breakeven close to 40 WTI Most efficient drillers are breakeven at 50 WTI which is already a remarkable numberThe companys synthetic oil production is even cheaper with breakevens between 20 and the mid30 rangeHence it is no surprise that the company aims to expand these operationsDuring its  the company made clear that it is aiming for approximately 280000 barrels per day of thermal production in both Q3 and Q4 of 2023This represents a growth of around 30000 barrels per day from 4Q22 levels welltimed with favorable Western Canadian Select pricing anticipated for the rest of 2023Thanks to efficient operations low breakevens CNQ is a cash flow monster Even at 70 WTI the company is capable of generating a free cash flow yield of more than 10These numbers arent just great in general but they also indicate the potential for accelerating shareholder distributionsWhyBecause the company has the goal to return all of its free cash flow to shareholders the moment its net debt falls below 10 billion With net debt between 10 and 15 billion half of its excess free cash flow will go towards debt reductionAnalysts expect the company to achieve this target next yearGiven the development of oil prices I expect the company to reach this target in early 2024This means that investors are in a great place to receive a total payout yield of 18 at 100 WTI I feel like a snake oil salesman when I say this stuff but its trueFree cash flow potential is really this great and a big part of the potential 18 return will consist of special dividendsThe company has increased its base dividend for 23 consecutive years Last year the companys buybacks alone were higher than the total distributions of 2021 Total distributions last year were close to 11 billionThe company currently pays a 090 per share per quarter dividend This translates to a base yield of 43 Please be aware that Im using Torontolisted shares for this calculation After all the company distributes its dividend in CADOn March 2 the dividend was raised by 59 after the company hiked its base dividend by 133 on November 3 2022Over the past three years CNQ has bought back 75 of its sharesGoing forward I expect very juicy special dividends and accelerating buybacks especially after the company reaches its debt target likely in 2024This should also allow the company to keep outperforming its peersOver the past ten years New Yorklisted CNQ shares have returned 193 This outperformed the Energy Select Sector ETF  by a wide margin It performed its oil and gas exploration and production peers  by an even bigger marginHowever it failed to outperform the SP 500 which is no surprise as the biggest part of the past ten years did not have favorable conditions for oil companiesGoing forward I expect CNQ to outperform the SP 500 and its peersValuationwise I believe that CNQ shares are extremely attractive This is based on free cash flow potential at elevated oil pricesHence I stick to what I wrote in my prior article including the potential of shortterm pullbacks that Im looking to use to further expand my CNQ positionThe rapid developments in the oil industry have exceeded even my own expectationsMy thesis rests on two key pillars the slowing growth of oil supply particularly with the decline in US shale production and persistent demand for oil despite the rise of renewable energy sourcesThese factors have resulted in a significant shift in geopolitical dynamics and provided a floor for inflation particularly in the face of rising energy pricesWhile the possibility of oil price corrections remains I firmly believe that once global economic growth rebounds we can anticipate a sustained period of tripledigit oil prices This outlook has led me to seek specific characteristics in oil and gas companiesI favor those with substantial reserves low breakeven prices robust balance sheets and a commitment to returning free cash flow to shareholders preferably through special dividendsOne company that has all of these qualities is Canadian Natural Resources With massive reserves a diverse product portfolio and a solid plan for shareholder returns CNQ has become one of my top picks in the oil sectorThe companys ability to generate cash flow at various price levels positions it for potential outperformance making it an attractive investment opportunityAs oil prices continue to evolve CNQs potential for growth buybacks and special dividends could provide investors with substantial returns for years to comeJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs Preferreds BDCs MLPs ETFs and other income alternatives 438 testimonials and

103,Canadian Natural Resources Is One Of The Best Oil Stocks Money Can Buy, I finally pulled the trigger on a stock Ive had on my watchlist since the day I first researched it Last month I deployed a big portion ofWhen I say that the company behind the CNQ ticker is one of the best oil companies on Earth Im serious CNQ has everything Im looking for in an energy stock This includes deep reserves low breakeven prices a healthy balance sheet a great dividend track record and the aim to distribute almost every penny of excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks Especially at a time when US shale production which was the global supply engine between the Great Financial Crisis and 2021 is running out of momentum I think investors need to be prepared for a prolonged period of elevated energy prices and invest in companies with deep reserves in a time when most are running out of tier 1 drilling inventory Currently the Permian is the only basin in the US capable of strong growth All other major basins have gone sideways since the pandemicNow even the Permian is expected to reach peak production at the end of next year as I discussed in a recent  On top of these bullish secular longterm developments  Arabia is determined to defend 80 Brent by all means necessary which is currently adding to the oil price rally Thats where CNQ comes in Not only do I need investments to protect my portfolio against inflation but its also a terrific income vehicle with the potential to outperform its peers and the market by a wide marginSo lets get to the detailsAs its 65 billion market cap may suggest Canadian Natural Resources is a giant In the second quarter the company achieved a quarterly production of around 119 million BOEs barrels of oil equivalent per day including natural gas production of about 21 bcf per day and production of liquids of roughly 847000 barrels per dayThese numbers were influenced by operational impacts from wildfires in Western Canada thirdparty pipeline outages and planned turnaround activitiesThe wildfires led to temporary shutdowns of some assets between May and July with no significant damage reported Most of the production affected by the wildfires has been restored which is the biggest takeaway when it comes to these fires Furthermore oil production from international assets remained steady Heavy oil production in 2Q23 increased by 15 compared to the prioryear quarter supported by strong drilling results counteracting natural field declinesOperating costs for heavy oil decreased primarily due to lower natural gas fuel costsWith that in mind the company has more than 30 years of proven reserves which beats its average peer by more than ten years Last year the companys new reserves exceeded production which shows that the company has way more than 30 years worth of highquality production which protects it against forced MA deals down the road  the same cannot be said about a wide range of peers Adding to that the company is breakeven at roughly 40 WTI which makes it one of the most efficient oil producers in the world It also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet The company ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of 07x EBITDA and remains wellprepared in terms of liquidity boasting substantial resources such as revolving bank facilities cash reserves and shortterm investments As of the end of 2Q the companys liquidity stood at an impressive 56 billionAccording to my calculations the company ended the second quarter with 121 billion in net debt Going into 2024 it could reach its target of 10 billion Once the net debt level has reached 10 billion the company sees no need to lower it further as it has pledged to distribute all of its free cash flow to shareholders In this case the company beats most of its peers that have pledged to distribute between 70 and 80 of free cash flow A big part of its distribution consists of dividends The company has a history of 23 consecutive dividend increases which include the Great Financial Crisis the 20152016 oil price slump and the pandemic After a 59 hike in March the current dividend is 090 per share per quarter which translates to a yield of 45 This excludes special dividends Last year the company paid a special dividend of 150 which brought last years total dividend to 460 This would indicate a yield of 57 using the current stock price When adding buybacks the total distribution yield was roughly 12 I expect this rate to remain high based on my bullish oil price thesis and the fact that the companys implied free cash flow yield is high At 85 WTI the company has a free cash flow yield of more than 12Meaning next year the company can distribute 12 of its current market cap if its net debt load falls to 10 billion At 100 WTI that number rises to almost 20 I almost feel like a snake oil salesman but its all based on reasonable assumptions and the companys ability to distribute cash The yeartodate returns to shareholders including dividends totaling 29 billion and share repurchases of 14 billion reached a significant milestone of 43 billion this year Thats 66 of its market cap in the first half of 2023 This also contributes to the companys consistent outperformance Over the past ten years NYlisted CNQ shares have outperformed the energy ETF  by a wide margin The performance even comes close to the SP 500s total return Since 2020 CNQ and XLE have outperformed the market by a wide margin I expect outperformance to continue as Im bullish on oil and believe that we will soon get a rotation from growth to value stocks benefitting undervalued stocks like CNQ It also needs to be said that the pending  TMX is expected to be opened in the next few months which will increasingly allow Canadian producers to capture better prices for their oil and reach more customers The TMX is one of the reasons why I like Canadian oil players in addition to their deep reserves and low breakevens According to Oilpricecom This brings me to the valuation Valuing commoditydriven stocks is tricky as the outlook depends on the price of commodities Looking at the relationship between CNQ and WTI crude oil we see that CNQ has gone sideways while oil has declined There are two reasons for this divergenceBased on the companys free cash flow potential I believe that it is about 50 undervalued if oil prices work their way up to 100 in the next 12 to 24 months On a longerterm basis I expect much higher gains accompanied by aggressive buybacks and juicy special dividends I think weve only scratched the surface when it comes to the companys ability to reward investors If my oil price thesis bears fruit we could be looking at a tremendous total return for many years to comeHowever for now we also need to incorporate recession fears I do not rule out regular corrections which I will be using to boost my position ProsConsI couldnt be more thrilled about my recent investment in Canadian Natural Resources With deep reserves low breakeven prices and a healthy balance sheet CNQ has all the qualities I look for in an energy stock As US shale production loses momentum and energy prices remain elevated CNQ stands out as one of the best oil companies on EarthTheir impressive dividend track record and commitment to distributing excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks make CNQ a great income vehicle that has the potential to outperform its peers and the marketConsidering the projected growth in oil prices and CNQs undervaluation I see tremendous potential for future gains While there might be some bumps along the way Im confident that CNQs ability to reward investors

108,CME Group: My Favorite Financial Dividend Stock,I feel whenever I say that something is my  it comes with a whiff of clickbait However Im very serious I always am  is my favorite financial dividend stock Not just atOn July 27 I wrote an  titled  In that article I discussed an increasingly favorable market environment for the stock Especially after a very volatile sideways trend since 2019 the stock is now finally sowing upside momentum rising 26 yeartodateIn light of new market developments Im dedicating this article to explaining why I am convinced that CME Group is one of the most resilient financial dividend growth stocks on the marketNot only does the company avoid default and relatedAs Im deciding how to structure my portfolio for the next few years Ive decided that Ill be buying a lot more CME stock than I initially plannedIn this article Ill walk you through my thoughtsSo lets get to itWe may be in the most challenging market environment since the Great Financial Crisis In this case Im excluding the uncertainty in 2020 when the world was figuring out how deadly the new COVID19 virus may become That was a scary time but not necessarily as economically complex as the current situationWe are currently facing a combination of challenges such as a decrease in economic growth Several European countries are already experiencing a recession Chinas economic growth is expected to stall due to significant problems in its housing market and in the United States growth indicators suggest weaker demandOn top of that inflation remains sticky This is an even bigger issue now as 80 of American households have run out of savings This is one of the reasons why so many consumerfocused stocks are performing so poorlySticky inflation is also causing interest rates to remain elevated which is hurting credit quality and economic demand Homebuyers now have to give up an average of 35 of their income to get a loan Thats up from the historical average of 28As a result were seeing an upswing in delinquency rates in auto loans credit cards and even mortgagesAlso to make things worse were about to see a wall of debt maturities over the next few years This includes private and public debtCurrent expectations are that the federal government is on pace to spend 10 trillion on interest payments by 2029 In 2020 that number was close to 300 billionAt this point the question is whether the Fed gets lucky and inflation quickly falls again in order for the bank to gradually lower rates or if it needs to act so aggressively that it hurts the economy to reach its inflation targetLooking at the market I believe were moving toward a hard landingHaving said all of this my strategy remains unchanged I buy highquality companies at great valuations This lets me sleep well even if it means my net financial worth is on a roller coasterOne of the best stocks to hold in this environment is CME GroupCME Group operates in the financial sector However its very different from banks and most financial institutionsThis company is a powerhouse and the owner of so many derivates and exchanges that are used every single day Buying CME is a bit like owning a casino Its better to own the house than to try your luck in the casinoIn the case of CME the company with a market cap close to 80 billion owns a number of major exchangesCME offers a wide range of futures and options contracts including interest rate products eg Eurodollar futures and options Treasury futures equity index products eg Emini SP 500 futures Nasdaq100 futures foreign exchange products eg currency futures agricultural commodities and moreCBOT trades various futures and options contracts including agricultural products eg corn soybeans wheat interest rate products eg US Treasury futures and equity index products eg Dow Jones Industrial Average futuresNYMEX specializes in energy and metals products trading contracts for crude oil natural gas heating oil gasoline and metals like gold silver copper and other base metals This includes the WTI crude oil contractCOMEX focuses on metal products including contracts for gold silver copper and other base metalsLooking at its 2Q23 overview we see that the company makes a big chunk of its money from interest rate and equity index derivates This includes the SP 500 EMini and an almost endless range of tools to hedge and trade interest rate fluctuationsBesides its unique range of derivatives what sets CME Group apart is its role as a primary price discovery provider offering crucial referential pricing information through realtime historical and derived data formatsThis facilitates customers in both listed and cash products Moreover they provide industryleading research and analytics tools serving as valuable market education resourcesThe company helps corporate treasuries to hedge interest rate risks farmers to hedge crop price risks food producers to hedge inflation risks gold miners to hedge against falling metal prices and so much moreWhat makes this widemoat business so powerful isnt just the high barriers to enter and its massive footprint but also that its an assetlight business model that does not require extensive investments to expand products and servicesCMEs innovation is mainly focused on new services and derivates So far this year the company has announced a number of new derivatives that cater to new needs to hedge risks It also allows market participants to track prices and speculate on price changesAll of these headlines can be found on  among many others as CME is rapidly expanding its product portfolioAnother major aspect is that CME has a somewhat anticyclical business After all when markets become volatile during or prior to recessions the company makes more moneyLooking at the chart below we see two major thingsThis brings me to the dividendBecause of its mature business model the company has no need to build a large cash position Unless it wants to engage in major MA However for now theres no indication that the company is looking for major dealsAs a result CME has made the decision to pay almost every penny in free cash flow to shareholdersThis is what its dividend history looks likeOn top of consistent base dividend growth the company pays an annual special dividendThe current base dividend is 110 per share per quarter This translates to a yield of 21On top of that the company announced a 450 special dividend in December 2022 it usually announces these special dividends in December If we assume that we get a similar dividend this year the total dividend yield is 42Total dividends paid last year were 28 billion Total free cash flow was 30 billion This year free cash flow is expected to be 34 billion which translates to an FCF yield of 45In other words thats what the total yield this year could look likeI think it could be higher as were seeing elevated volatility in every asset class again like commodities equities forex and bondsIn its 2Q23 earnings call the company highlighted some tailwinds For example the average daily volume ADV across commodities increased by 20 with a 34 growth in agricultural products 27 growth in metals and 9 in energyCME also emphasized the crucial role of options with an ADV growth of 20 to 47 million contracts in Q2 including record agricultural options ADV up 32 from the same quarter last yearThe company also touched on the rates market and commodity exports causing increased demand for risk management using their benchmark productsSo what about the valuationCME Group is trading at 245x LTM free cash flow It is trading at just 218x NTM free cash flow This makes CME very attractive especially in light of a high probability of prolonged aboveaverage volatilityAs a result shares have accelerated in recent days while the market has gone southThe current consensus price target is 210 which is 1 below the current priceI disagree with that and believe that the stock is between 15 and 20 undervalued Thats based on a 25x free cash flow multipleHence Im a buyer Over the next few months I hope to see another dip in CME which I can use to aggressively add to my positionI believe that CME will suit me very well for decades to come and I will use any opportunity to add  especially in this market environmentIn a challenging macroeconomic environment filled with uncertainty and economic complexities one stock stands out as a resilient choice for dividend investors  CME GroupThis financial powerhouse operates differently from traditional banks and institutions owning major exchanges and offering a wide range of futures and options contractsIts unique position as a primary price discovery provider and its assetlight business model make it a toptier player in the marketCME Group not only thrives during times of market volatility but also boasts a robust dividend history with consistent growth and annual special dividends With a base dividend yielding 21 and the potential for a 42 total dividend yield its a dividend investors dreamMoreover CME Groups attractive valuation trading at around 218x NTM free cash flow presents an opportunity for savvy investors As the market experiences heightened volatility CMEs prospects continue to shineIn this turbulent market environment I see CME Group as a longterm winner and Im ready to seize any opportunity to add to my position With its resilience and dividend potential CME Group is my top pick for financial dividend stocksJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs Preferreds BDCs

111,"Energy Transfer Acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners Will Rally The Bears, But It's A Strong Move",On Wednesday 81623 news broke that Energy Transfer  agreed to  Crestwood Equity Partners  deal valued at 71 billion This deal is likely to rally the bears as I fully expect to see many comments andCEQP is an MLP that operates feebased assets within the energy infrastructure space CEQP provides solutions across the value chain to accommodate the needs of largescale upstream producers in the major basins CEQP owns and operates a large array of assets tied to natural gas liquids NGLs crude oil and natural gas and provides produced water gathering storage disposal and transportation to its partners These are fundamental needs for any upstream producerThe three main basins that CEQP focuses on are the Williston Powder River and Delaware basins In the  CEQP provides 420 MMcfd of natural gas gathering capacity 250 MBblsd crude gathering capacity 421 MBblsd of water gathering and 430 MMcfd of natural gas processing capacity In the Powder River Basin they provide 398 MMcfd of natural gas capacity and 345 MMcfd of processing capacity In the  they provide 11Bcfd natural gas gathering 90MBblsd crude gathering 354 MBblsd water production and 613 Mmcfd of processing capacity CEQPs  are mainly on the east coast with some located in the south In total CEQP has 13 liquified petroleum gas terminals offering 10 MMBbls of contracted storage and pipeline capacities providing integrated supply and logistical services to producers and refiners They also have 13 trucking and rail terminals 500 NGL truck  trailer units 1100 railcars and pipeline capacity to domestic and international marketsUnlike ETs previous acquisitions when you overlay CEQPs assets with ETs assets this is more of an expansion than complimentary The  deal provided ET with 3000 miles of gathering pipelines to its Permian pipeline network and 2 million barrels of storage in Midland Texas The  added significant pipeline mileage in the midcontinent region and made ET the largest processor in the region and the largest transporter by pipeline milesNormally we see ET complement its current assets and expand its pipeline extensions This deal is different as there is a mix of complementary and outright expansion into new areas ET will complement and strengthen its asset mix in the midcontinent region and add significant assets in the Williston Basin and in Central America This deal is opening up new opportunities through expansion as ET will now operate in the Powder River Basin expand its presence upward throughout the northeast and establish a foothold in the midsouthThis deal doesnt make sense to me from an asset perspective unless ET is looking to fill out connectivity throughout the east coast or Middle America From an asset standpoint this deal is a much larger expansion than we have normally seen as ET typically has stuck to complementary assets We know that Kelcy Warren has a track record of growing through acquiring and has publicly said that companies will need to expand to thrive I think this deal is a stepping stone for a much larger future deal I have no knowledge but I would speculate that if the ONEOK  and Magellan Midstream Partners  deal falls through they will try to acquire OKE MMP is holding a special meeting to vote on the deal on 92123 and as I outlined in my article on the deal  there has been a lot of opposition especially from  who own roughly 3 of MMPWhen I look at the combined asset map from ET and CEQP and then I look at OKEs assets below it would be a strong strategic move ET just increased its presence in the Williston Basin and established operations in the Powder River Basin By acquiring OKE ET would gain a 40000mile network of NGL and natural gas pipeline but more importantly significant takeaway capacity from the Williston Basin and the Bakken Shale Basin ET would also gain muchneeded infrastructure for its new assets in the Powder River Basin I dont think ET is done and I have a feeling that the CEQP deal is a stepping stone to a largescale deal that will shock the energy infrastructure spaceET has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CEQP at a  enterprise valuation in an allequity deal This deal dilutes unitholders but ET isnt utilizing any of its cash While ET is projected to issue 219 million units they are also adding 33 billion of debt to their balance sheet as they assume CEQPs debt in the transaction The unitholders from CEQP will get 207 units for every 1 unit of CEQP in the deal and its expected to close in Q4 2023Here is what ET is gaining from a numbers aspect In the TTM In the TTM ET as a standalone company has generatedET has 4891 billion in  on the books and when they assume  the total debt will increase to 522 billion which is the same amount of debt ET had in 2020 If the two were a combined entity today their TTM numbers would look like the followingET would increase its revenue by 684 its Adjusted EBITDA by 595 and its DCF by 693 Its margins would decrease by a small fraction as Adjusted EBITDA would still represent over 16 of revenue and DCF would represent over 1040 of revenue ETs total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio would slightly increase from 374x to 377x based on the TTM numbersI think the bears will disapprove of this acquisition and we will see a lot of negative comments on this article and future articles written about ET From my perspective I like the deal and think its a smart move ET is assuming the debt and issuing units to fund the remaining portion of the deal and not touching its cash While the debt will increase on the balance sheet ETs total debt to Adjusted EBITDA when looking at ET and CEQP as a combined entity on a TTM basis doesnt really change much ET would still be under a 4x ratio which is a better ratio than we have seen in the past ET is taking another piece off the table and I think this is setting the stage for a largescale deal in the future ET once again has expanded its relevancy and widened its moat in the midstream space I think this deal will help change the markets perception and maybe bring a more realistic valuation to units of ET as they continue to be significantly undervalued  Disclaimer I am not an investment advisor or professional This article is my own personal opinion and is not meant

112,Energy Transfer Selling Off Is An Opportunity Yielding 9.66%,Energy Transfer  is having a strong 2023 as units appreciated from 1162 to a 52week high of 1367 Units of ET are retracing a bit after earnings finishing the week down 406 ET has now missed I am prorenewable energy and I am invested in several renewable energy companies because they are projected to increase their percentage in the global energy mix over the next several decades Why I see the opportunity in renewables I am a realist and understand that eradicating oil and gas isnt probable over the next 2030 years I continue to read many different energy industry publications to understand current trends and future predictions I continue to allocate capital toward energy infrastructure companies due to the information I will share from these publicationsOver the past decade there hasnt been a year where global oil production exceeded the amount consumed In 2022 the global economy consumed 97309000 Bpd of crude while the production level was 93848000 Bpd Natural gas has been produced at a slight surplus over the period compared to the deficit of oil produced The US is the largest oil and gas producer producing 1893 of global oil production and 242 of global natural gas production When Canada is accounted for an additional 594 of oil production and 457 of natural gas production comes online This is the main reason why I am consistently allocating capital to energy infrastructure companies There is 2487 of the global oil production and 2877 of the global natural gas production occurring in North America and it all needs to be treated and transportedThe 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids and natural gas will increase through 2050 in the US The US will also remain a net exporter of petroleum and liquified natural gas LNG products If the US which is the largest oil and gas producing nation globally is projected to increase production and be a net exporter through 2050 the logical conclusion is that more takeaway capacity will be needed and energy infrastructure companies will generate larger levels of distributable cash flow DCF as more fuel passes through their systemsIn  completed its acquisition of Lotus Midstream for a combination of 930 million in cash and 445 million of newly issued units ET added 3000 miles of active gathering lines and 2 million barrels of crude storage ET is projecting that the integration of Lotus will generate significant synergies between the companies and immediately enhance their ability to generate free cash flow and distributable cash flow I like the deal because it provides ET with a bidirectional connection from the Permian Basin to Cushing OK and adds capacity to other major hubs including MidlandET finished Q2 generating 312 billion in Adjusted EBITDA and 204 billion of DCF on a consolidated basis 154 billion of the total DCF is attributable to the partners of ET ET saw its NGL fractionation volumes increase 5 midstream gathering volumes increase 8 NGL transportation volumes increase 13 intrastate natural gas transportation volumes increase 3 crude transportation increase by 23 ET guided that in 2023 we will see between 131 billion and 134 billion in Adjusted EBITDA which is the largest amount from all the MLPsFor the past several years I have discussed ETs strength in the exporting sector and why it was a strategic move for the company ET has export facilities on the East and Gulf coasts with a large pipeline system that spans over 120000 miles ET recently signed  to sell LNG from the proposed Lake Charles export facility in Louisiana The first deal that was announced was with an unnamed Japanese consortium for the purchase of 16M tonsyear for a 20year term The 2 agreement acts as a middleman where Swiss commodities trader Gunvor would buy LNG from Chesapeake Energy  at a price indexed to the JapanKorea Marker for 15 years CHK would supply the Lake Charles facility with enough volumes of gas to produce 1M tonsyear for 15 years after liquefaction The 3 deal is with an unnamed US customer and involves a tolling arrangement for 1M tonsyear for 15 yearsThe Lake Charles facility has come under question and on the conference call ET discussed this project at length In May of 2022 ET received an extension from FERC on the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028 The DOE denied ETs request for an extension for the commencement of exports and in April denied ETs appeal placing this project in Limbo We have now been informed that ET has been in discussions with the DOE and is filing a new application for export authorization ET expects to file in August and during the DOEs review work with existing customers prospective equity investors and other stakeholders to progress the development of the Lake Charles export facility Ultimately I believe that ET will be granted the authorization because commodities are too important to the US in global trade and there will be a continuous need for US energy on the global stageThe Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the US and international markets ET has made a final investment decision on an expansion to its NGL export capacity at the Nederland facility to address increased demand They expect the expansion to cost 125 billion and add roughly 250000 bpd of export capacity ET also is pursuing a project at the Marcus Hook facility that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacityI am bullish on ETs future because as the demand for energy increases so will the need for ETs services throughout the value chain ET generates incremental profits throughout every segment in transporting crude natural gas and natural gas liquids Exporting could be a critical differentiator between ET and the rest of the sector in the future and allow ET to grow even quicker If ET gains the approvals from the DOE it will expand their exporting capability and should drive higher volumes through their infrastructure due to contracted exportsET goes  on 811 and the current distribution is larger than before the cut In the November 2020 distribution ET made a 50 reduction from 305 to 01525 Since the February 2022 distribution ET has provided unitholders with 7 consecutive quarterly distribution increases bringing the annualized distribution to 124 On the conference call management indicated that they will continue to target a 3 to 5 annual distribution growth rateIf ET grows the distribution at a 4 rate which is the midpoint of their guidance the annualized distribution could grow by 17 by the 2027 distribution Management reduced its leverage acquired 2 companies and provided 7 distribution increases bringing the distribution above its prior levels before the cuts in less than 3 years ET is getting back to its roots and could become a distribution growth machine I think between the new acquisitions and the potential export expansion ET has the ability to provide larger increases to the distribution in the future and this is becoming an enticing yield story all over againI updated all of the numbers for the MLPs I compare ET against and they still look undervalued I used the following MLPs in my peer groupET trades at the lowest Adjusted EBITDA to market cap ratio in its peer group at 302x The peer group average is 539 and units of ET still look to be on sale compared to this metricETs EV to Adjusted EBITDA is 789 compared to a 931 peer group average PAA trades at a similar valuation then the rest of the group trade between 936x and 1179xWhen looking at the DCF that these companies generate compared to their market caps ET trades at 466x compared to a 702x averageET has the largest amount of debt but they also produce the largest amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF ET has a 374x total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio which isnt that high even though its the largest in the peer groupET is also the largestyielding MLP in the peer group with a 973 yield compared to the peer group average of 798I still feel that ET is undervalued considering you are paying 302x its market cap for ETs Adjusted EBITDA and 466x for its DCF Today you would be getting the largest yielder out of the growth with a commitment to 35 in annual distribution growth at the lowest valuation Oil and gas arent going away and with the global demand set to increase along with production in the US ETs services will continue to see increased demand If units continue to retrace in the coming weeks I think the opportunity will just get stronger I think ET deserves a stronger valuation and eventually the market will come around  Disclaimer I am not an investment advisor or professional This article is my own personal opinion and is not meant to be a recommendation of the purchase or

113,Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nationThis has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently however As regular readers may recall we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices although that is almost certainly a factor As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience Investors are no longer willing to wait years or decades to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios In todays highrate environment their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now Energy Transfer currently boasts an 884 yield so it certainly meets this requirement In fact this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the SP 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves however Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense todayAs stated in the introduction Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines storage facilities natural gas liquids fractionators natural gas processing plants and terminals The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant Overall its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific CoastThis is not especially surprising as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state As a result there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a resultAs mentioned earlier it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfers units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfers unit price since August 3 2023We can obviously see a correlation here as the two charts move almost in lockstep However Energy Transfers cash flows have very little to do with oil prices As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90 of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA a proxy for pretax cash flow will come from these volumebased contractsThus the companys financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers not their value As such its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the companys adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years In particular the average price of West Texas Intermediate was 3968 per barrel in 2020 6817 per barrel in 2021 and 9453 per barrel in 2022 The yeartodate average for 2023 is 7790 per barrel and Energy Transfers annualized adjusted EBITDA is 13110 billion Thus we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the companys adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believeWith that said there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do After all there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices However as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Profits in Dividends it is unlikely that this will be the case As the Wall Street Journal I pointed this out in a few articles published over the past two years in various shale companies as well Basically due to investor complaints about the industrys underperformance over most of the past decade shale companies are largely opting to simply keep their production stable and pay out the majority of their cash flows to investors Thus it is unlikely that Energy Transfers volumes will increase substantially due to shale producers increasing their output along with energy pricesThis does not mean that Energy Transfer has no nearterm to midterm growth opportunities just that the company will probably not see the volume growth that the market expects For example there are still significant growth opportunities in the natural gas space as energy producers are constructing an enormous amount of liquefied natural gas production capacity over the next few years Indeed the nations consumption of natural gas is expected to increase by 20 billion cubic feet per day by 2027 approximately 14 billion cubic feet of which comes from new liquefied natural gas production facilities that are scheduled to come online over the periodEnergy Transfer is engaged in some growth projects to take advantage of this situation For example the company stated recently that it is investigating the possibility of constructing a new natural gas processing plant in the Permian Basin due to strong customer demandThis is in addition to the 200 million cubic feetperday Bear processing plant that the company brought online in June The company also has a number of natural gas pipelines under construction that are meant to increase its ability to meet the growing demand for natural gas domestically as numerous utilities are replacing coal power plants with renewables supplemented by natural gas plantsAfter all wind and solar are not capable of meeting electric demand on their own with current technology and batteries are nowhere near sufficient to provide sufficient backup capacity It is fortunate that Energy Transfer is reasonably well diversified and has long had a substantial presence in the natural gas space to allow it to take advantage of this growth potential Indeed as we can see here the companys cash flows are quite well diversified between crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquidsMost of its forward growth will almost certainly come from the natural gas and natural gas liquids segments but that is okay as the company should still have much greater growth potential than some other midstream companies that exclusively focus on crude oil or refined productsEnergy Transfer could soon increase its presence in the natural gas space significantly by acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners  The company  on August 16 2023 that it is planning to acquire Crestwood Equity Partners in an allstock deal From the press releaseAs of right now Crestwood Equity Partners common units are trading at 2860 each and Energy Transfers units are at 1406 per share Thus the proposed ratio assigns a value of 2910 to Crestwoods common units That is a 175 premium today which is not really much but the premium was higher when this deal was announcedThis deal will certainly enhance Energy Transfers capabilities in the Bakken Shale as Crestwood Equity Partners is one of the largest midstream operators in that region Crestwood Equity Partners also has a gathering and processing business in the Powder River Basin which is an area in which Energy Transfer currently has no presence at allEnergy Transfer meanwhile has the takeaway capacity and longhaul pipelines that Crestwood Equity Partners lacks Overall I can certainly understand why Energy Transfer wants to do this deal Ultimately it could work out quite well for the company as it allows the combined firm to offer a onestop service for customers in the Bakken Shale Crestwoods substantial gathering and processing operation in that region can handle that need for the customers and then Energy Transfers longhaul pipelines can move it to where it is neededAs separate entities neither company can offer both services to customers Crestwood Equity Partners is also more natural gasfocused than Energy Transfer so this acquisition should weight Energy Transfers business a bit more towards gas As that is where the strongest growth is that is certainly a positive thingUnlike my rather scathing  on ONEOKs  acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners this one has some clear synergy and will probably benefit Energy Transfer The only real downside for Crestwood Equity Partners unitholders is that Energy Transfer has a lower yield so they could lose some income Hopefully Energy Transfers growth will be stimulated enough by this acquisition that it can raise its distribution to compensate for the loss but that is not certain For the most part though this deal should work out to the benefit of both partiesAs I pointed out in my previous article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer has been slowly seeing its interest expenses tick up recently although it has not been nearly as bad as companies in some other areas of the economy We can see this hereAs we can clearly see the companys training twelvemonth interest expenses have been gradually ticking up over the past few years although it has only been a relatively slow increase Certainly this is a less worrying trend than we have seen among utilities or a few other sectors One of the biggest reasons for this is that the market has not been friendly towards midstream companies for quite some time and Energy Transfer started focusing on strengthening its balance sheet following the COVID19 pandemic We still see that the companys interest expenses have been trending up however Thus we should not ignore the companys balance sheetOne metric that we can use to evaluate a companys financial structure is its net debttoequity ratio As of June 30 2023 Energy Transfer had a net debt of 48632 billion compared to 41457 billion of partners equity This gives the company a net debttoequity ratio of 117 Here is how that compares to some of the companys peersAs we can see here Energy Transfer compares quite well to its peers in this respect In particular MPLX which has long been one of the bestfinanced companies in the midstream sector actually employs more leverage than Energy Transfer This is a clear sign that Energy Transfer is not employing too much leverage right nowAs I have pointed out in various articles a midstream companys ability to carry its debt is much more important than its overall financial structure The usual way that we judge that is by looking at the companys leverage ratio which is also known as the debttoadjusted EBITDA ratio During the twelvemonth period that ended on June 30 2023 Energy Transfer had an adjusted EBITDA of 13080 billionThis compares to a total debt of 48962 billion as of June 30 2023 That gives the company a leverage ratio of 374x which is very reasonable As I have pointed out before Wall Street analysts usually consider anything below 50x to be reasonable However most companies have been working to reduce their leverage since the crash in energy prices in 2020 As such most midstream companies now have a leverage ratio that is below 40x which is the maximum level that I typically like to see As we can clearly see Energy Transfer easily meets this criterionWhen we consider that the companys net debttoequity ratio compares reasonably well to its peers and that its leverage ratio is very attractive we can quickly see that the company enjoys a very strong balance sheet There is really not very much for us to worry about here The companys finances are quite strongIn conclusion Energy Transfer continues to be a good holding for those investors who desire to earn a high level of income from their portfolios while still enjoying some growth potential Admittedly it is somewhat unlikely that the nations upstream energy producers will deliver growth that is anywhere close to what some market participants expect but there are still sufficient opportunities in the natural gas space for Energy Transfer to deliver volume growthThe pending acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners is interesting and it should significantly enhance Energy Transfer LPs potential to deliver natural gas midstream growth to the unitholders The company continues to maintain relatively strong finances and pays a very attractive 884 distribution yield Overall this company looks like a very solid purchase todayEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the

115,BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty: Call Option Like Gamble On Higher Crude Oil,I have been bullish on crude oil for several months now I wrote an article on the   back in  explaining why the odds favored another push higher forI have also mentioned a short list of other ideas to own as ways to take advantage of any oil  gas surge in prices I have written bullish views on names like    Of course a number of variables could keep crude oil under US100 a barrel next year My thinking is a recession may do the trick But what if a new and unexpected supply shock hits the oil market like a major war in the Middle East If some unknown event to us today does appear over the next 12 months crude oil could spike well above 100Dont laugh maybe cry but the 2008 spike high of 140 a barrel adjusted for inflation is roughly 230 a barrel in current dollar terms 15 years later To be honest reviewing its price adjusted for inflation in the overall US economy since 1989 crude oil is sitting at a LOWER than average price level vs the latest 35 years of trading historyAnyway the last few weeks I have been researching which investments have the best leverage to sharply higher crude oil without taking on insane amounts of risk My answer for a play on rising crude oil that could turn out to be a terrific hedge in your portfolio if energy prices jump dramatically during 2024 is to purchase a small stake in  BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust operates as a grantor trust in the United States It holds overriding royalty interest in the Prudhoe Bay oilfield located on the North Slope of Alaska set up by   in 1989 The Prudhoe Bay field extends approximately 12 miles by 27 miles and contains approximately 150000 gross productive acres Currently the Prudhoe Bay oilfield is owned and managed by privately held Seeking Alpha contributor  is basically the expert on this security writing on it for better than a decade The trust has a unique termination clause where the agreement could be dissolved after several years of weak production in Alaska depleted reserves or very low crude oil prices In his article summary from  Mr Cunningham lays out the framework for BPTs possible dissolutionAnd with no revenue during the first two quarters of 2023 it is entirely possible low crude oil prices will mean the trust heads closer to zero for price into the end of 2024 So in a sense low energy prices would bring an expiration date eventually just like a call option traded on regular financial securitiesMr Cunningham also reviewed his estimates on the minimum crude oil prices necessary to generate BPT revenue out a few years pictured below In the end if these cutoff prices are breached to the upside over the next year and a half the odds favor BPT sticking around for owners The good news is crude oil prices are today in the low80s per barrel near the necessary prices for the trust to generate revenue again You will also note the breakeven price is escalating rather quickly between 202224 rising from 76 a barrel in December 2022 to an estimate of 96 by the end of 2024Below you can see how the trust got perilously close to being terminated into early 2022 after 6 quarters of minimal revenues following the onceinalifetime pandemic bust in energy prices during early 2020 The trusts price fell under 130 in October 2020 on worries crude oil would not rebound in time to save BPT ownersOn the longterm chart from 1989 when BPT went public several things regarding how the trust has fluctuated in price vs crude oil jump out to me First is the gargantuan price rise from 6 in 1999 to 130 in 2011 Including steady dividends over most of the period BPT gained 1200 for shareholders vs just 27 in total returns between March 1st 1999 and January 3rd 2011 for the SP 500 index During this span crude oil rose from 13 a barrel to 110Second you will notice the rotten performance since 2011 as crude oil prices have failed to keep pace with inflationary rises overall Todays trust quote of 653 is back to 1999 levels Remember the way the trust is designed a currently rapid rise in breakeven costs to generate revenue and cash for dividends is shutting the window for the trust to remain in operationThe trust has been able to pay dividends really in every year outside of parts of 2020 2021 and now 2023 The structural and mandated design of climbing breakeven costs is bringing the idea of trust expiration to the fore BP never intended for the trust to live foreverThe 2year daily price chart adjusted for dividends below outlines a nice summary of the rewards and risks of owning the trust The monster advance in crude oil during the first half of 2022 supported a spike in BPT from 3 to 22 per unit which produced one of the top oilgas gains during the Russian invasion of Ukraine energy shortages for Europe Then a normalization of supplydemand for oil has pushed the trust back into worries about its longterm viabilityBecause of trust termination risk being different than other oilgas royalty names it is truly a boombust pick for performance On the 5year total return graph vs peers below you can easily see BPT has been the worst buyandhold idea of the group Plainly stated if crude oil prices do not rebound over 90 the rest of 2023 andor 100 in 2024 BPTs price will decline markedly and no serious dividends will be paidHowever the 53 gain in crude oil between the end of December 2021 and June 2022 helped BPT owners to a 637 advance over six months My research conclusion is a major spike in crude oil to 120 or even 150 a barrel in 2024 could turn the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust into the top performing oilgas royalty investment againI am personally torn about what to do with BPT My official 12month rating is  Yet I wanted to highlight the upside potential of this honestly degradingdecaying crude oil leverage name If I knew 120 oil was approaching next summer I would be bullish on owning the trust If I knew 150 oil was coming by early 2025 I would be wildly bullish on BPTThe trust did pay out 415 in dividends between late 2021 and early 2023 So a large spike in crude oil may allow the opportunity to get most of your purchase price today 653 back in cash distributionsHowever if crude oil succumbs to recessionary demand over the next 612 months with quotes under 80 a barrel next year BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust may be headed to 1 or less by the end of 2024Given trouble in the Middle East erupting soon a buy now decision will likely prove a great hedge for your portfolio Otherwise any drift lower in price at the same time as crude oil zigzags higher above 90 would deliver a better riskreward proposition in my opinion For the moment I am holding off purchasing a stake But BPT is on my radar for instant leverage to climbing crude oil

117,Could We See $100 Oil In 2023?,Goods things finally appear to be happening for energy bulls After languishing in mediocrity over the first half of 2023 oil prices now appear to be recovering and could well be setting up for another leg higher WTIAs it stands the fundamental outlook for the market appears quite constructive for the second half of 2023 and should these bullish factors remain in place a rally to 90bbl or even as high as 100 is not out of the questionStarting with the physical market crude oil inventories have flirted with both builds and draws for much of the year  giving little fundamental signal in theThis was the largest weekly drawdown of US crude oil inventories since the data was first recorded in 1982 And as we can see below not only does this appear bullish on an absolute basis but also on a seasonally adjusted basisFor crude oil analysing inventory changes and inventory levels provides a decent realtime proxy for the supply and demand dynamics within the market Should this record drawdown be a sign of things to come this bullish turn in inventories should continue to support prices for the months aheadIn similar fashion to changes in inventory levels the shape of the crude oil futures curve provides valuable insight to the ongoings within the physical marketAlthough the actual prices of the various futures contracts are themselves not useful predictors of future prices the shape of the futures term structure does provide valuable information into the underlying fundamentals of the oil market and is another excellent indicator of the status of the physical market GenerallyAgain similar to inventories the term structure has provided mixed signals for much of the year as it has flirted with backwardation and contangoAs it stands the curve now resides in firm backwardation across the board though not the same degree as was seen during 2021 and early 2022 Nonetheless this remains a bullish outcome for now as the market looks to be becoming increasingly tighter as we enter the second half of 2023Prompt and longerdated time spreads are also confirming this dynamic Both are sitting firmly in backwardation and confirming the recent move higher in WTIMeanwhile US crack spreads for refined products such as diesel jet fuel and gasoline have all also moved higher in line with the recent rally in crude thus confirming the tightness in the market as indicated by the backwardated term structure Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined productsFrom a positioning perspective everyone and their dog has been either short or bearish oil for quite some time now so there has been and remains still plenty of scope for a sustained positioning driven squeeze higherIndeed the managed money component of the futures market ie hedge funds and CTAs recently had their smallest exposure to oil in almost a decade as recently as early July And while their buying activity has fuelled much of the rally thus far there remains plenty of scope for speculators to drive prices higher stillLikewise total speculative positioning as a percentage of open interest remains close to favourable contrarian levels despite the recent rallyIn terms of the supply and demand outlook for oil it appears we could see deficits return to the market throughout the second half of the year if they are not already present Though I view their forecasts with a grain of salt the EIAs projections suggest global demand will exceed production by 098 mm bpd deficit in Q3 followed by an additional shortfall of 038 mm bpd in Q4Similar projections are being made by commodity analysts at Standard Chartered who  suggesting a  Likewise the IEA have also recently revised upward their demand forecasts and now predict a 17 mm bd shortfall through 2H23While demand overall still lags its preCOVID trend it has recently hit an alltime high As  by Bloombergs Javier Blas  Whether we like it or not it continues to look increasingly apparent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar lack the efficacy efficiency and base load capacity to replace fossil fuels so it stands to reason peak oil demand is still likely decades awayOn the supply side Saudi Arabia have confirmed they will extend voluntary production cuts through September this puts the cumulative effects of Saudis total production cuts over the past year or so at around 3 mm bd meaning their overall production is now around 9 mm bd below their estimated maximum of 12 mm bd Meanwhile Russia have also suggested they plan to cut exports by 300000 bd by next month after already agreeing to reduce exports by 500000 bd in AugustIt seems increasingly the case Saudi Arabia have now positioned themselves as the worlds swing producer of crude oil given the lack of investment in US shale of late This is likely a dynamic the Saudis will continue to leverage in the short term as they have hinted that current cuts could be extended or even deepened While Saudi Arabias production cuts are largely responsible for the supply shortfall we are likely to see throughout the second half of 2023 such supply shortages  coupled with reasonably strong demand  suggest the market will remain tight at least through the next quarterFrom a technical perspective the picture has improved dramatically this past month WTI looks to have broken out of its downward ascending wedge pattern that has been slowly developing over the last year whilst also breaking through key moving averages As it stands the 82 level looks to be key resistance for now and whether or not we can break through this level will be very informative as to how sustainable any potential 2H23 rally can beFrom a seasonality perspective the outlook remains favourable for the next quarterOn the whole the outlook for the oil market over the second half of 2023 looks quite bullish Market technicals trend and seasonality look to be taking a turn for the better while fundamental indicators of the physical market such as the term structure inventories and crack spreads also look to be leaning toward the bullish side of the equationUltimately there appears plenty of scope for higher prices in the coming months But while I remain very bullish oil over the long term and expect to see prices reach midtriple digits at some point in the future I am skeptical that this will occur in 2023Indeed there are a number of factors at play which could put a ceiling on prices in the medium term For one as discussed earlier much of the supply shortages seen in the market today are a result of Saudis numerous production cuts Should prices spike to the 90100bbl level it seems likely they will once again ramp up production to take advantage of these higher prices Whats more while Chinese oil consumption has disappointed this year we have seen the Chinese work to significantly increase their commercial and strategic stockpiles in recent months and history suggests they could release these barrels onto the market should prices rise sufficiently And finally while the economy remains robust for now the  for economic growth continues to appear subpar which may or may not impact demand in late 2023 to early 2024 Either way the second half of the year looks to be an existing one for energy bulls The summary bullets for this article were

119,Petrobras: A Return To Bearish Ground As History Comes Full Circle,Over the past few months I have been one of the few Seeking Alpha analysts who have  a bearish outlook on Petrobras   due to various sources of political risks However this pessimism hasMy initial pessimistic stance was primarily rooted in concerns about shareholder control and the potential impact of government decisions on Petrobras especially given the companys historical context Legislative changes such as the injunction that reduced government control over stateowned companies could have substantial implications Its worth noting that Petrobras current CEO is a former politician from the same party as Brazils current president LulaOne of the fundamental questions for theIn light of these factors my outlook remains cautiously pessimistic Its crucial to closely monitor future developments and their potential impacts on Petrobras and the broader oil industry Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of this scenario and observing how the situation unfolds in the coming years will be intriguing Brazils history with past leftwing governments especially during Dilma Rousseffs administration has led to longterm value erosion for PetrobrasWhile its still too early to make definitive predictions I believe its highly improbable that the company will thrive under a management that repeats the same mistakes as those made in the past which clearly had a detrimental impact on its valueThe significance of oil to the Brazilian economy is a topic that deserves careful consideration in my opinion The true nature of this resource is often misconstrued Oil has served as the primary energy source throughout the past century and continues to hold that position Despite the growing shift towards renewable energy sources oil remains indispensable and is unlikely to become obsolete shortlyHowever owing to Petrobras being a stateowned company there exists a misconception that the oil it extracts exclusively belongs to the state This misconception stems from a historical slogan in Brazil Such beliefs lead people to expect low gasoline prices complicating Petrobras management and government decisionmaking Society must grasp that while oil is indeed a valuable resource it is not the sole property of Brazil and international factors influence its priceOil and natural gas constitute the primary sources of revenue for the National Treasury and this trend is expected to continue for many years Oil plays an integral role in Brazils trade balance and its production is rising In 2022 426 billion of crude oil was shipped  13 of total Brazilian exports a share only one percentage point behind soybeans Exploring new areas like the Equatorial Basin is imperative to maintain high production levels Oil is critical in the economies of various nations globally including Russia where it remains vital even during conflictThe Brazilian government often fails to comprehend the economic significance of oil and tends to focus primarily on fuel pricerelated issues People need to recognize that oil is both lucrative and pivotal to the economy and they must understand its relevance in the context of the global economyPetrobras has delivered positive results thanks to effective management in recent years particularly during the presidencies of Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro This has proven advantageous not only for Petrobras shareholders but also for the Brazilian economyThe current government led by President Lula experienced some luck concerning the price of the oil barrel From January until July the price fell to approximately 70 to 73 per barrel enabling Petrobras to lower gasoline and diesel prices However starting in July prices increased again surpassing 90Fortunately once again the exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the US dollar declined offsetting one factor against the other Petrobras still operates with some delays in price adjustments but these favorable factors have contributed to its stock performanceNow shifting to the diesel issue the Russian war has significantly impacted the diesel market due to sanctions imposed on Russia These sanctions have led Russia to sell diesel at a much lower price than domestic diesel Approximately 80 of Brazils diesel imports come from Russia which has been beneficial However I have concerns about Petrobras futureThere was a period when Petrobras encountered significant difficulties particularly during the transition of government leadership from President Dilmas departure to President Temers assumption of office in 2016 The company faced a challenging situation even holding the worlds highest debtor title Additionally Petrobras faced at the time complications due to an unfavorable exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the US dollar which stood at R4Petrobras recovery from 2016 has relied on implementing a development plan cost reduction and capital management However these measures appear to have been neglected recently which raises concerns for me I am concerned about the possibility of Petrobras  in unprofitable refineries or oil fields Additionally there are questions surrounding Petrobras pricing policy The company discontinued its Import Parity Prices policy IPP in May and introduced a new pricing policy that is not entirely clearAs Brent crude oil prices have been climbing since July Petrobras reached a nearly 30  on fuels under the new pricing policy which recently compelled the company to raise fuel prices in the country However the discount persists with Brent crude oil continuing its upward trendBy the end of September the  set at Petrobras refineries currently show a 136 discount on diesel and a 23 premium on gasoline compared to the international market price parity This marks a change from the previous week when diesel and petrol had discounts of 136 and 55 respectively compared to international pricesThe premium on gasoline is due to Petrobras price increase which coincided with decreases in prices at international fuel hubs This increase was partially offset by strengthening the US dollar during the week which rose 14 Diesel prices remained relatively stable over the weekPetrobras needs a clear investment plan but it seems this is currently on hold under the new managementPetrobras has  a possible investment in offshore wind energy Firstly Brazil lacks regulations for offshore wind energy investments This means that the company is subject to congressional approval which can be uncertain due to the lack of a clear government majority In addition over the last 20 years Petrobras has accumulated a series of destructive projects such as Pasadena Abreu e Lima and others resulting in significant lossesIn my analysis Petrobras should focus on its core activities such as deepwater oil production rather than venturing into new projects Resources are scarce and investing in offshore wind energy may not be the smartest choice Another point to consider is the energy transition Brazil already has a clean energy matrix emphasizing hydroelectric power Investing in offshore wind energy may not be necessary since the country has already made its energy transitionThe idea of exporting energy is also questionable as it would require investments in transmission infrastructure to export energy to Europe and the US which is not feasible now  show that offshore energy production is one of the most expensive and least efficient Therefore investing in something that spends a lot and produces little doesnt seem wise Also many concerns exist from the lack of regulation to allocating scarce resourcesParallel to this Petrobras recently reported that its board of directors had approved a new  reducing the free cash flow distributed to shareholders from 60 to 45The companys investment cash flow for the upcoming years is still uncertain Petrobras has not yet released its investment plan which is expected to be disclosed along with the strategic plan 2024 and beyond in the coming monthsOver the last five years Petrobras achieved an average operating cash generation of approximately R 160 billion annually while the average cash flow from investments was R 40 billion Half this amount was allocated to maintaining operations while the other half went to growth and new business lines approximately R 20 billion eachI believe its crucial not to attempt to predict the future with absolute certainty but rather to engage in analysis We are witnessing higher oil prices in the second half of the year although they are not as high as they could be primarily due to factors like Chinas slower growth Oil plays a pivotal role in the economy as energy catalyzes economic growth Completely forsaking fossil fuels especially when oil consumption is expected to rise in the coming years and supply remains limited is not a viable optionMoreover there are two major players in oil production namely Saudi Arabia and Russia Brazil needs to expedite its oil production to capitalize on the growing demand and avoid overreliance on these major players However its essential to acknowledge the environmental discourse Countries like the UK are  legislation to phase out the use of fossil fuels Nevertheless Brazil should not follow a contradictory path by importing liquefied natural gas from the United States while financing a gas pipeline from Argentina instead of developing its productionCarbon capture technology is advancing and could contribute to mitigating the environmental impact of fossil fuel production The challenge lies in finding ways to use fossil fuels more cleanly while simultaneously promoting the utilization of renewable energies Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly accessible and efficient but its essential to recognize that oil will remain a significant energy source in the foreseeable futureWhile OPEC  a strong demand for oil in 2024 traders have  their concerns from undersupply to potential oversupply due to the structure of the global benchmark Brent futures contracts This shift comes as expectations of weak economic growth outweigh Saudi Arabias output cutsAs a result I believe it is unlikely that oil will experience a sharp drop to very low prices such as 30 or 40 in the coming years Oil will continue to play a significant role in the global energy landscapePetrobras continues to trade at exceptionally low valuation multiples compared to other global and domestic private oil companies with a PE ratio 4x versus the sector average of 10x However its essential to clarify that this 60 discount is primarily due to the significant political risk associated with the companyFurthermore when considering the forward EVEBITDA Petrobras trades at a premium compared to Norwegian stateowned Equinor ASA  and political risks influence both companies valuationsPolitical risk cannot be quantified as it hinges on government decisions that can swiftly and dramatically impact the companys stock eroding investor confidence Petrobras has  its CEO 17 times in the last 30 years starkly contrasting privatelyowned oil companiesAt current price levels Petrobras is trading at 28x forward 2024 EVEBITDA with a 20 cash flow yield for 2024 These levels may appear attractive but do not account for the risks associated with potentially harmful investments or unwise acquisitions Additionally there is pressure on refining margins compared to wellmanaged private peers with successful track recordsFurthermore recent measures such as curtailing international parity and reinitiating investments in noncore initiatives have raised additional concerns Frequent changes in shareholders and presidents often driven by political pressure and fuel price concerns should not affect Petrobras managementSatisfying Petrobras shareholders also equates to serving the broader society as all Brazilians are indirect stakeholders in the company Petrobras generates dividends which the government can allocate to investments in critical areas like education healthcare or national debt reductionHowever the generous dividends distributed last year are expected to diminish The forecast for 2024 and beyond is regressive due to the implementation of the new dividend policy and potential challenges stemming from price gaps and investments in noncore businessesIts crucial to acknowledge that Petrobras is profoundly influenced by the international market with oil prices playing a pivotal role If oil prices surge it will present a substantial challenge for the company Nevertheless I believe Petrobras can rebound by taking the appropriate measures Ideally the company should acknowledge its past mistakes and rectify them However the abandonment of development strategies and an uncertain pricing policy are sources of concernI do not see the current government making the optimal decisions for Petrobras and there remain numerous uncertainties about the companys future The energy transition is also crucial but oil remains significant in the Brazilian economyPetrobras stock seemed to have encountered a resistance of around 15 per share in midSeptember relying on favorable conditions including lower Brent crude oil prices in the years first half Even as oil prices rose since July the foreign exchange rate variation favored Petrobras which I view as primarily the outcome of fortunate circumstances rather than reflecting the companys improved fundamentalsConsidering that at the beginning of the year amid political uncertainties becoming more evident in the market Petrobras was stuck in limbo struggling to break the 12 support until May And thats where I predict the stock is heading especially as more discouraging news continues to emerge with the company trading at a forward PB that is 17 above its historical average Consequently I maintain a bearish outlook on Petrobras for the long term

123,U.S. Oil And Gas Echoes Macro And Geopolitical Environment (Video),The most unfortunate threats to global economies are the volatility and instability wrought by the recent attack on Oct 7 of Israel We were already troubled by the Russia invasion of Ukraine There has subsequently been a reworking of energy trade routes with both oil and natural gas With the trouble in the Middle East energy trade relationships could alter courses againThe centers of geopolitical gravity of late have been the Middle East and Russia Notably in a recent USEU  a NATO leader spoke of how US LNG hasWith respect to the Middle East where I have spent much of my bandwidth assessing and the majority of my time from Oct 4 to now even  of course oil prices have risen to reflect a risk premium Just like what happened with Russia last year markets start to settle once specific events and their direction are more apparent But we have groups willing to incite scorched earth policies and events Eventually this will have repercussions in another form whether it be domestic political instability or being out of favor with investors as an investment destinationIn both cases alternative sources of gas and oil have been found by market participants The US is a significant player as a source of global oil and gas supply in Asia and more so in Europe than previouslyAlso in Europe from a NATO perspective they continue with sustainable sourcing of energy such as alternative fuels microgrids storage  more homegrown solutions In Montana on a panel and conversation with a former Governor of Montana we talked about various forms of storage and energy Energy storage is becoming an increasingly interesting space in which new ventures and acquisitions will be happening All of the majors such as Exxon Mobil  and Chevron  are investing to make sure they can play in emerging energy spaces of the futureGiven the events of the day oil and gas markets and the energy transition have changing investment implications Interest rate increases are a driver in ways we are just starting to see especially with renewables and EVs Higher rates shift decision making This idea was echoed by the CEO of ATT who l listened to at the economist conference I attended just before Montana Regarding transition type investments I would focus more on needsbased investments The Inflation Reduction Act legislation is a real mixed bag on its incentives distortions and ultimate effects and thus capital signalsIn the end oil is fungible and a mosttraded commodity In advanced economies electrification is becoming potentially more inflationary with all of the factors of green as witnessed in Europe Many countries in Europe are rolling back their initial plans to some degree but not entirely either Power generation grows in the rest of the world From a recent Texasfocused energy conference at Texas Tech University on Oct 20 unique demand centers are emerging in the tech space that can offset the supplydemand mismatches that are occurring My 2023 theme of  is playing out in a big way in Texas owing to its decentralized marketThe natural gas trade is shifting around the globe as alluded to in the  work The US is a lowcost producer in oil and gas and a reliable partner Were a global benchmark as I noted in the past and in my Montana presentation roughly half way throughOil prices will remain higher with tight supplies occurring to the year end US producers are expected to respond but this is still a capital discipline regime by oil and gas firms It seems that natural gas prices in the US will stay on the lower side Importantly US production is a player on the global stage with new avenues emerging as geopolitics shift thinking and strategiesIn recent West Texas Intermediate or WTI a key US oil price benchmark is now to be folded into the global benchmark Brent alongside its other constituentsIn the past I have written extensively about Pioneer the Permian and more recently about the Exxon acquisition The markets reception is quite significant and positively viewed Given the events of the last couple of weeks in geopolitics its all the more positive that consolidation and scale occur in parts of the industry In my article from April where the acquisition idea was floated much is covered First    potential tieup articleWith the ChevronHess   announcement the continuing consolidation in the industry indicates the ideas of scale and efficiency this was discussed and analyzed more indepth since the first quarter of 2023The   possibly looking to acquire Marathon Oil  speaks to this continued themeAt the National Association of Business Economists conference Oct 910 a few takeaways stand out One of the sessions I attended focused on the macro environment with attention to rising longterm yields This Wall Street Journal article speaks to the ideaLogan didnt delve deeply into what specifically is driving up term premiums But on Wall Street many have  that yields have been rising largely thanks to a growing federal budget deficitHowever being in the room on Oct 9 my notes sayPressure is stemming from longterm yields Where the pressures are coming from determine the direction of interest rates changes whether up or down Logan mentioned that half of the longdated yields is from the term premiumThen the 19 Fed Chairman Powell  echoing what Logan had saidOn the global macro side Logan mentioned slowing global growth in the second and third quarter Chinas structural issues influence this but also nearshoring trends are influencing global trade flowsAdditionally I was struck by a comment in the deindustrialization panel Bottomline Different trading relationships are happening Were still dependent on China trade its just happening differently via proxies such as VietnamAlso theres the chance that trading blocs shift toward that of likeminded partners North America looks good and offers balance Other parts of the world are more difficult to project especially now with this current crisis and its effect in the Middle East and beyond In the longer term the momentum of markets will prevail  but we are effectively disruptedOur US industry is global capable and efficient We will continue to utilize technology to produce resources more efficiently and cleanly in the future I think with Exxons purchase of Pioneer the sheer size of Exxon will allow for new advances in the Permian and translate elsewhere The same is true of the ChevronHess acquisitionIn general my geopolitical takeaway is Disengagement is not an option We can engage with the rest of the world in energy and alongside our capital markets That is a positive path forward our technology innovative minds and markets transparencySecondly the theme of natural gas being a transition fuel is still my main idea in that thought experiment However on a practical level natural gas is a generally reliable and affordable source of baseload power It has a cleaner emissions profile and more work is being done globally to cleanup methane emissions a byproduct of its production when not addressedWith regards to Energy Transfer  and an upcoming feature the eventual start of their Lake Charles LNG plant is a net positive for the US the industry and other countries There has been support for their stewardship in this capacity from global players such as Shell  and others Once the story is online I will post a link in commentsIn summary US oil and gas offers a bullish investment theme as noted in the video Given geopolitics oil market tightness and the economic outlook the majors have picked their moment well In the  shale story I noted that the majors had l and now they have returned In 2023 they have returned again in even more full force The requisite energy infrastructure has to work connecting supply to demand centers as geopolitics and market conditions shift the landscape again The midstream sector which includes diversified players like Energy Transfer with their large global footprint also will be part of the solutionEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be

125,Attacks On Israel Introduce Tail-Risks To Oil Prices,At the outset our thoughts and sympathies go out to those affected by the shocking attacks in IsraelThis past weekend we witnessed a severe escalationBefore these developments the ongoing talks around normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel were a key market focus given their potential implications for oil production Saudi Arabia had reportedly expressed a willingness to boost oil production if crude prices remained high This was part of a complex deal brokered by the US that aimed for Saudi Arabias recognition of Israel and a commitment to increased production The talks were under close scrutiny by investors asHowever the recent attacks have dramatically shifted these dynamics The escalating conflict has likely decreased the chances of nearterm normalization in SaudiIsraeli relations This could potentially affect Saudi oil production plans leading them to extend their existing cuts for a longer period which could further deplete already low global oil inventoriesAnother significant player in the global energy market Iran is also expected to see a major shift in US policy Before the attacks the US had adopted a softer posture toward Iran allowing it to approach pre2018 levels of oil production However given recent events and Irans known support for Hamas the US may adopt a stricter stance potentially leading to a reduction in the Iranian oil supplyThese developments underscore the real and potentially harmful risks presented by geopolitical uncertainties Persistently high oil prices could drive inflation affecting both stocks and bonds In these uncertain times assets sensitive to geopolitical events could serve as a potential hedge In particular we believe the energy sector which is intrinsically linked to geopolitics may offer an opportunityThat said the implications of recent events are only beginning to emerge and we will watch closely in the coming weeks for signs of potential direction and impact for commodities and the broader financial markets and economy 20092023 Neuberger Berman Group LLC All rights reserved ,2,2023-10-27,2

127,Hess: The Future Of Oil And Gas,John Hess CEO of Hess Corporation   his view as to why the company is investing in longterm projects like Guyana Oil and gas has long predicted to die shortly But the history has never workedI cover Chart industries  and have for a backlog that was up 24 for the newly combined company Chart itself is a relatively small player so its orders tend to be lumpy But the backlog has shown steady progress despite the renewable transitionChart does handle several parts of the renewable markets like the rapidly growing hydrogen market But the oil and gas business remains a significant part of the business Currently that business is not slowing down due to the announced transition to renewablesA suppliers optimism as is the case here speaks volumes about the future of oil and gasThis backs up what John Hess states when he says we need to invest 4 trillion in renewable investment per year to bring about that energy change we talk about But actual investment is about one third of that There will not be a fast energy transition due to low investment levels in that transition Therefore the oil and gas business has a bright outlook with growth in use even if the market share of the energy source declines oil and gas needs considerably significant and continuous investment to meet the growing energy needs under any scenario The industry view right now is that the Net Zero goal shown above is not realistic because the money is not there to bring that about The industry does realize that could change But theres no sign it will change from really stated policiesActions are always more important than words Obviously as usual with politics the actions do not come close to meeting the words because of the sheer magnitude of the cost Some realism would help But Im not holding my breath for that realismThere are plenty of changes in the past that serve as a guide as to what will likely happen with the transition to renewables even coal with all its disadvantages has grown in absolute terms until very recently This history belies the argument that any new energy sources will render the use of an older energy source extinct Instead what it does do is give all consumers a choice of energy sources and they pick the optimal source for them Thats highly unlikely to change anytime soonAs John Hess pointed out even if oil and natural gas use remains steady theres plenty of declining production that needs to be replaced in the future But the other issue for several of these sources is that they are used to make many products besides oil For years coal was necessary to make steel for example So even if the energy need eventually fades then we would need new technology to replace the use of a lot of these energy sources elsewhere to get over the need to use oil and gas for energy we would still need oil and gas for the products listed above and probably more because the list above gives you an idea but is probably not a complete list There are industrial chemicals like Benzene for example from which aspirin can be made from that are not on the listThis means that the longterm outlook for oil and gas is bright even with the emphasis on renewablesWhen it comes to reducing emissions Hess is in the catbird seatHess has been rapidly growing production from one of the lowest emission projects in the world Thats automatically going to reduce average emission intensity the corporation reports just by growing productionOffshore production is pollution friendly because operators often as is the case here reinject any natural gas produced and related gases back into the reservoir to maintain well pressure and enhance oil recovery Exxon Mobil  the operator intends to do that whenever possible well into the future This makes not only Hess but a whole lot of offshore producers relatively environmentally friendly compared to just about any other project where the gas is not reinjected This reinjection procedure is relatively new to the industry It also gives the industry a way to tout low emissionsMany state that Hess is one of the more expensive stocks But Hess is the smallest player in the Guyana partnership As such its likely to become a takeover target at the right price in the futureThe current market value of the stock is in the 46 billion range Hess has a 30 interest in the 11 BBOE which is worth about 10 in the ground in the current environment This alone is worth roughly 33 billionBut John Hess has mentioned several times that the partners know theres oil at the 18000foot level whereas most of the discoveries are at 15000 ft so many would double that first figure just from that statementThe partners have not yet hit a series of dry holes and are testing some of the recent discoveries to update that figureIn addition John Hess updates the Total  and Apache  discovery in Suriname because Hess is right next door to that discovery Developments there are likely to soon influence the partnership decision different partnership to drillAlso John Hess mentioned that the partnership now has six ships active in the Guyana acreage This gives them an advantage in the extra year as the partnership only had three ships active in fiscal year 2020 when the pandemic stopped exploration cold This extra year is meant to replace the time lost back then Anything the partners can move to developed acreage is acreage that will not be part of the 20 giveback when that happens next year Therefore the race is on and now it is on with six shipsThe above guidance puts a description to the expectations of John Hess that he expects profits to triple every five years The margin will expand due to the unusual profitability of the Guyana partnership So profits will grow faster than production After five years most expect Hess to show growth from more than one lease in Guyana and Suriname although timing is uncertain and depends upon what are now assumptions working outOptimism for Hess is building along with the reserve increase The reason is that now the market can see the cash the Guyana project generates Therefore more reserves are not equated to gold at the end of the rainbow Its a very profitable rainbow too John Hess has promoted the company for three years stating this was quite a find and probably longer But really no one paid much attention until the cash began to roll inNow Hess may well become a concept stock with a concept valuation like Tesla  and Netflix  were But the difference here is the market can see a climbing pile of cash well into the future now that Guyana superior profitability is becoming apparentJohn Hess did mention that Exxon Mobil as the operator was changing manufacturing plans for the FPSOs these are the ships that handle the oil and gas processing offshore and store the production as well by doing premanufacturing to keep costs down so that the breakeven remains at worldclass lowsWhile Hess has certainly other assets that are doing well all eyes are on Guyana as that production has come to dominate the future of the companyDespite the price of the stock its probably still a risky and volatile strong buy for those that can stomach the bumpy ride of oil and gas Guyana is still in the early stages of development This small company is likely to find ways to continue to triple production every five years for a while Mr Market loves stories like that But the high priceearnings ratio is raising investment riskEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange

128,Why Enbridge Is Overrated,While I certainly understand the need for retirement income many retirees with substantial assets and income from Social Security and pensions still get convinced brainwashed into thinking that they need to overemphasize dividend income yield simply because theyre retired Typically this strategy causes them to significantly lag the returnsAnd despite all the bullish articles on Enbridge  and readily admitting that I wrote some of them  today I argue that Enbridge  is yet another example of what Im talking about here and the chart below proves itAs can be seen in the graphic above and despite ENBs strong dividend growth and its current 72 yield the 10year total returns just like XOM and T have been relatively abysmal in comparison to the broad market averages as represented by the Vanguard SP 500 ETF  the SPDR DJIA ETF  and especially the Invesco Nasdaq100 Trust My followers know that Im a big fan of a topdown capital allocation strategy  one that divides a portfolio into various categories and then allocates capital according to each individuals personal considerations goals retiredworking comfort level etc Personally I recommend the SP 500 be the foundation of any portfolio given the vast majority of individual investors and even the majority of professional money managers fail to achieve the average annual returns of the SP 500 over the long runOther categories might be Growth Technology Sectors Energy and for example the one we will be talking about today Dividend GrowthIncome After retiring at 45 Im a big fan of dividends and get the majority of my dividend income from energy stocks like Exxon Chevron  ConocoPhillips  Phillips  and  yes  even Enbridge That being the case the Energy and Dividend Income categories within my own personal portfolio are effectively mergedBut lets get back to Enbridge I inherited ENB shares when Spectra Energy sold out While Enbridge did keep its promise with respect to dividend growth in the years immediately following the merger Im sure many former Spectra shareholders would agree with me that they would likely have been much better off had Spectra remained an independent company But then again former Spectra CEO Greg Ebel has taken over as President and CEO of Enbridge so thats how that works sometimesThe primary investment thesis for ENB is income and  at least it was  excellent dividend growthThe red line with the strong upward slope were the dividend commitments made to shareholders with respect to the Spectra merger completed in February 2017 However since those commitments were met note the dividend increases have been less than impressive Indeed the last dividend increase was only   despite the fact that DCF grew by 93 from 20212022 But hey like I said at least the merger got done rightBut of course income is only part of the total returns equation And from a stockprice appreciation standpoint ENBs 10year track record is in a word pitiful The stock is currently  where it was 10 years agoAnd I should know I own the damn stock and right along with Exxon there were many years in a row when both stocks were at the very bottom of my investment spreadsheet during the biggest bullmarket of my lifeAs most all of you know Enbridge is a pipeline oriented company that gets the majority of its cashflow from liquids and natural gas pipelines It also has renewables operations and it owns the Union Gas utility company in Canada The point is that the majority of ENBs cash flow is stable and supported by longterm energy delivery contracts 98 of contracted volumes are cost of service fees with 80 of EBITDA having builtin inflation protection All this is goodWhat isnt so good is that ENB had for years been targeting a 60 payout ratio a somewhat low and relatively arbitrary choice for a midstream company with such a large percentage of feebased and inflation protected cash flow However ENB has big growth plans and they advertise its growth plan as being self funded But as longtime ENB investors know the company has a track record of somewhat pushing on the growth string which on multiple occasions resulted in tying up billions in shareholder capital in largescale pipeline projects that got hung up in court  adding significant additional expense to the projects original brightnrosy costsreturns estimates In addition though the company says its selffunding growth debt continues to grow as wellCertainly ENB took on additional debt as a result of the Spectra takeover However according to Seeking Alphas  ENBs debt has continued to grow since the Spectra merger was closed in 2017Indeed the company has added an estimated 53 billion in additional debt since the merger closed and currently has a whopping 5476 billion in total longterm debt And while the company likes to toot its horn about its current 47 DebttoEBITDA ratio being in the lower half of its target range ie 4550 the company still has to pay interest on that debt Last year the interest paid on ENBs longterm debt was 215 billion  thats over 1share Note the 2023 dividend was 355shareTo have a 5476 billion debt load more than half its marketcap is probably not a good idea in the first place But considering that ENBs largest segment transports oil sands crude one could argue that fact puts an additional risk premium on the companys debt I say that because investors have to consider that in an age of global warming goosed renewables clean tech and EVs that diesel transportation fleets will eventually get electrified Considering oil sands producers make heavy crude which is an excellent feedstock for high distillate yield refineries fleet electrification could have a big impact on demand And of course oil sands production in and of itself is considered to be a relatively heavy CO2 emitting industryEnbridge is another in a long line of income related investments that while certainly fulfilling its investment income thesis has significantly lagged the longterm total returns of the broad market averages While the current 72 yield is attractive is it really so attractive as compared to my 5 yielding money market fund such that I will risk tying up capital in a company that so significantly lags the broad market averages has an arguably high debtload and could very well face some existential threats from EVs and global warming I will leave that up to the individual investor to consider as a homework assignmentMeantime Ill end with a 10year total returns chart of Enbridge in comparison Exxon Chevron and ConocoPhillips   all companies that pay decent dividends and yield 33 38 and 39 respectively Note that even ExxonMobils 10year returns have nearly doubled the total returns of EnbridgeIs Enbridge overrated You bet it is And the next time it gets above US40 I will start selling my shares before it  once again  retreats back from that level Just as it had to my dismay many times in the past  I

130,Crude Oil Prices Reach A 13-Month High,Last week crude oil prices reached their highest price since August 2022 with West Texas Intermediate Crude reaching 95barrel on Thursday Whats more the Energy Information Administration EIA reported a bigger weekly inventory drop 22 million barrels than analysts anticipated placing inventories at a 14month lowThe inventory of refined products is now 13 below its 5year average As refineries shut down to shift to oxygenated winter fuels refined product inventories will remain lowHigher energy prices help shrink the trade deficit and boost GDP That explains why the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit declined 73 in August as imports declined 12 to 2531 billion while exports surged 22 to 1688 billionAt quarters end the Atlanta Fed forecast 49 annualized third quarter GDP growth aided by a lower trade deficit and higher energy exportsTheFurthermore the diesel shortage is rising again especially in Europe so the US is exporting more distillates diesel heating oil jet fuel etc which is causing the trade deficit to decline and boost GDP growthNaturally since gasoline prices are high Joe Bidens popularity is plunging in the pollsWith 4 gasoline prices and up to 6 per gallon in California and other locations and with an imminent debut of 4 unemployment rates due to an 11month manufacturing recession it should not be surprising that Joe Biden is almost 10 behind candidate Donald Trump in a recent ABC NewsWashington Post pollDue to rising food and energy price inflation consumers are not happy The Presidents war against fossil fuels is failing especially against natural gas since in America we are blessed to have the cheapest natural gas in the worldMore pipeline projects are now reemerging as natural gas prices meander higher Natural gas prices are very sensitive to the weather and ideally perform best in hot miserable summers for peaker power plants and very cold winters for heatingThis winter is forecast to be much colder in Europe and North America due to an El Nino weather pattern which indicates higher natural gas pricesCandidate Donald Trump clearly wants to restore lower gasoline prices shore up the US southern border and end the war in Ukraine but there are other qualified challengersRussia may also want to keep energy prices high to impact the 2024 electionsAll this international chaos is expected to keep crude oil prices high Furthermore Joe Biden is going to have to defend spending billions to fund the war in Ukraine while disaster relief in Maui and East Palestine Ohio is widely believed to be lackingAmidst this chaos plus ongoing labor unrest in the US with the UAW being the biggest of several strikes this year American consumers remain grumpy but continue to spend up a storm as their credit card bills grow to record levelsHowever due to a strong US dollar the price of imported goods should continue to decline as falling EV prices have demonstrated and the US keeps importing deflation from ChinaAs a result of these many distractions our best defense remains a strong offense of fundamentally superior stocksIn addition to all the refinery and energy stocks we own I also recommend 1 the best AI stocks 2 drug companies profiting from the booming demand for weight loss medication 3 the strong demand for cruising and travel 4 selected crop shortages and 5 resurging semiconductor demandIn other words we invest in timely economic sectors with improving sales and exploding earningsThe overall earnings environment is poised to steadily improve over the next four quartersWhile a strong US dollar may hinder the earnings of some big multinational companies since almost half of SP 500 revenue comes from outside of America the growth stocks I recommend are not expected to be hurt by a strong US dollar Furthermore positive analyst earnings revisions could deliver big earnings surprisesIn other words we remain locked and loaded for another earnings announcement season starting soonLast Friday the Commerce Department reported that the Feds favorite inflation indicator namely the Personal Consumption Expenditure PCE index rose only 01 in August and 35 in the past 12 months The core PCE excluding food and energy also rose 01 in August and 39 in the past yearThis is good news for future Fed policy decisions If the PCE continues to cool off the Fed will not need to or want to raise key interest rates further The Commerce Department also reported that consumer spending rose just 04 in August down from 09 in July so consumers are becoming more cautiousInflation excluding energy is also decelerating around the world One example is in Germany where consumer price inflation decelerated to a 43 annual pace in September down sharply from a 64 annual pace in August German consumer prices are now running at their slowest pace in two yearsEurostat on Friday also reported that consumer prices for the entire eurozone declined to a 43 annual pace in September down from 52 in August This was better than economists consensus expectation of 48 and the lowest pace for eurozone consumer inflation since October 2021 Due to decelerating inflation it is now widely believed that the European Central Bank ECB will pause raising interest ratesWill the Fed listen to reason I think so Of all current members of the Federal Open Market Committee  I respect Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari the mostNeel ran the TARP program under former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in 2008 so he has been stresstested Neel has been a dove in recent years but he became a hawk in the past yearAt the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School Neel said If the economy is fundamentally much stronger than we realized on the margin that would tell me rates probably have to go a little bit higher and then be held higher for longer to cool things offAlthough the financial media assume Neel is in favor of another rate hike I expect that higher jobless rates and slowing retail sales may force Neel and other FOMC members to reject another rate hikeIn other important economic releases last week the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that it slashed its calculation of personal consumption in the second quarter down to only 08 from its previous estimate of 16By comparison personal consumption rose 17 in the first quarter so consumers were clearly becoming more cautious in the second quarter Overall GDP grew at a 21 annual pace in the second quarter as strong business investment offset slowing consumer spendingAlso the Conference Board announced that its consumer confidence index declined to 103 in September down from a revised 1087 in August This was a much bigger drop than economists expected since their consensus estimate was 1055 Consumer confidence is now at its lowest level in the past four monthsMy biggest concern now is high 10year Treasury rates I anticipate that Treasury bond yields will finally moderate when the debt ceiling is lifted but in the meantime these ongoing budget battles contribute to artificially high Treasury yields that are getting close to 5 across the entire yield curveOver the weekend Congress merely kicked the can down the road to midNovember but if Congress does not pass a stopgap funding measure between now and then be aware that essential workers like TSA air traffic controllers and customs officials would stay on the jobHowever funding for the big bureaucracies like the Commerce Department and Labor Department would dry up so economic data would cease to be released This would obviously cloud the economic data the Fed is monitoringIn the past partial federal government shutdowns have suspended funding for the federal courts the FTC the SEC and other federal agencies Typically federal workers are reinstated within two weeks with full back pay so a shutdown for most workers is like a free vacation in the midst of stale old political theaterAll

133,Midstream Income For Life,Sometimes I really think about how simple my oneyearold grandsons life isAsher doesnt read the news Or pay the bills Or even know what the news or bills areWhat a happy state of existenceThen again he also has people dictating what he eats when he eats how he eats and where he eats As well as why he eats what he eats when how and whereThe same goes for naptimes bedtimes playtimes the toys he has what he wears Pretty much his whole entire world is determined by outside forces Which Im sure can get frustratingIve seen the proof since like most babies and lets face it most adults too Asher isnt always fond of being told no Then again considering the news and bills due these daysMaybe the tradeoff is worth itLife is expensive And involved And as we keep seeing through the economic headlines and in person its getting more expensive and involved still Sure the inflation rate is down but inflation itself is notIts just headed higher more slowly than before So any additional money we can bring in is important to talk aboutThats why Ive been writing this Income for Life series First I published   Then it was  And now were onto a third installment this one focused on energyEnergy of course is part of the reason why life is so expensive right nowIts not the entire reason mind you Im well aware of that and not trying to start any fights about what else is and isnt involved in our pocket painsBut I think we can all agree that the fuel situation isnt helping As the cost of transportation goes higher  whether by plane ship truck or whatever  the price tags of everything else tend to follow This only makes sense for anything that needs to be transported from raw goods to finished products at the end of the manufacturing lineTheres no escaping it Whether youre shopping for a house new furniture and appliances food or whatever you buy from Amazon costs are upSo why not profit from those expenditures if possible Which as Energy Income for Life is about to show you it isIm not talking about buying and selling oil directly mind you Commodities trading is complex and volatile Its not a headache I care to have And I wouldnt wish it on anyone else who doesnt have the time money knowledge and wisdom it takes to make it workI believe in investing in companies that do have all that going for them instead Let them deal with all the industry ins and outsI just want to kick back relax and take a cut of the profits Or perhaps I should put it this way considering how much else there is to deal with these daysI dont want another set of responsibilities on my shoulders if I dont have to Which in this case I dontNeither do youThats one small part of why energy fits so perfectly into my Income for Life series The companies that deal with and in it perform a certain way offering essential services wrapped up in neat little boxes tied with bowsTake real estate investment trusts or REITs They own entire portfolios of properties where theyre in charge of finding tenants maintaining tenants and collecting rent from those tenantsREIT investors dont have to worry about any of that hassle And take it from a former landlord it can be a major hassleBusiness development companies or BDCs meanwhile are financial institutions that lend money to the otherwise unlendable Businesses that cant easily find fiscal backing whether because theyre small struggling or in a problematic industry  can very often turn to a BDC for helpThe BDC researches them determines the most viable terms to work with them and monitors the borrower and borrowings from there Then they summarize all of that for their investors to read over while sipping on a cup of coffee or teaMaybe even a cocktail on some sandy beachEnergy companies do the same just with portfolios of well energyYou could argue that description fits a larger array of stocks than Ive mentioned above I know So heres the real reason to keep reading Dual profit potentialREITs and BDCs reward their shareholdersAnd so do the energy companies Im about to dive into Today Ive got three particular picks to recommendTwo of them are dividend aristocrats with plenty of growth potentialBefore we continue bear in mind that MLPs do not technically pay dividends They are called  Also shares are called  For everyones convenience Ill go with dividends and shares in this article as not all picks are MLPs so please do not be confusedI start this article with the gold standard of midstream companies The company isnt just one of the oldest and bestmanaged master limited partnerships or MLPs but it also enjoys our highest quality ratings among midstream companiesAs the subtitle already shows that company is Enterprise Products PartnersFounded in 1968 Enterprise Products Partners has become one of the most important companies in the North American energy grid as it now manages more than 50000 miles of pipeline storage capable of holding more than 260 million barrels of liquids 30 natural gas processing plants 25 fractionators to produce valueadded products and 20 deepwater docks to service overseas energy demandLast year the company made roughly 42 of its money in the Natural Gas Liquids Pipelines  Services segment 32 of its sales came from the Crude Oil Pipelines  Services segment The remaining dollars came from Petrochemical  Refined Products Services and Natural Gas Pipelines  ServicesEssentially this giant combines all important feedstocks to buyers that turn these into products we use every day This includes fertilizers food packages water pipes medical supplies helmets diapers lubricants tires paints and obviously gasoline and dieselIn addition to this the company helps companies expand production in critical areas like the mighty Permian basin the only basin capable of keeping American shale production in an uptrendIn 20232024 the company is bringing four new gas plants online scheduled to increase processing by 12 billion cubic feet per dayOn top of that the company helps America to increasingly export its fossil fuels This isnt just a benefit in light of rapid middleclass growth in emerging markets but also a necessity in light of the Ukraine war where fossil fuels are used as leverageRight now Europe barely receives any natural gas from Russia putting tremendous pressure on the US to keep the lights in Europe from going outOne of the reasons  if not THE reason  why EPD is such a highquality stock is its consistent financial performance Like its peers the company is spending billions on new infrastructure However the company is older and had a large profitable network in place when others were still in the early phases of expansionA lot of MLPs cut their dividends in 2015 when high investment requirements met imploding commodity prices and lower demandEPD did not cut its dividendEven better EPD is a dividend aristocrat with 25 consecutive years of dividend hikesSince 1999 the company has covered its dividend every single year using its consistently rising distributable cash flowThis dividend isnt just backed by consistently rising distributable cash flow but also a healthy balance sheetThe company enjoys an A credit rating with an average weighted cost of debt of just 46 It has no debt maturities in 2023Next year the company is expected to generate 58 billion in free cash flow which implies a 10 free cash flow yield This covers the 75 dividend and investments in growthmaintenance with a wide margin of errorWith regard to growth the dividend has a 5year CAGR of 28 which beats the Feds inflation targetWhile it needs to be seen what the company is up to it is not unlikely that dividend growth will accelerate a bit in the next few yearsThe current market capitalization of the company along with its expected net debt and potential EBITDA puts its estimated EBITDA for 2024 at 89xThis also includes the minority interest income streams the company doesnt fully own which are valued at roughly 10 billionDespite this the valuation is still attractive when compared to the companys usual trading range of close to 10x EBITDABased on this the companys fair value is estimated to be 18 above its current unit priceiREIT has a rating on the stockEnergy Transfer is a comeback stockDuring the pandemic the company cut its dividend Now its back with a very bright future aheadWith a market cap exceeding 42 billion this giant is going back into the MA gameLast month it made an offer to buy Crestwood  in a 71 billion deal including debt which would make it one of the bestdiversified midstream giantsET would expand its footprint in oilweighted basins and increase its exposure to some of the Nations largest upstream companies The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval The deal might close in the fourth quarterEven without these assets ET is one of the largest midstream companies in North America servicing all major basins in the South the Powder River basin and the Williston basinThe company owns 34 of Sunoco LP  which distributes motor fuels to independent dealers and operates 76 retail stores in Hawaii and New JerseyWhile its market cap is a pretty good indicator of its size there are a few impressive numbers I want to share with you For example the company gathers roughly 20 million MMBtu of gas per day and transports more than 4 million barrels of crude oil per day It is capable of exporting roughly a quarter of that in its own facilities90 of its EBITDA is dependent on fees which means that commodity price fluctuations arent a major issue  at least not compared to companies that actually produce oil and gasEnergy Transfer is also a stock that shows a lot of conviction from its management Not only does it have one of the highest insider ownership rates in the country 12 but it is also mainly owned by retail investors who own roughly 50 of all unitsThanks to its mature business and strong tailwinds consisting of rising global demand for natural gas oil and refined products the company is in a good spot to protect and grow its dividend while focusing on growth opportunitiesThe companys longterm capital allocation strategy aims to distribute more than half of its distributable cash flow to shareholders Roughly a quarter of its discounted cash or DCF will be used to grow the business 7 to 20 will be used to reduce debt and buy back unitssharesThanks to its focus on debt reduction the company has a much healthier balance sheetIt is expected that the net debt at the end of this year will be 503 billion which is likely to decrease gradually to 46 billion by 2025 Taking into account the gradual increase in EBITDA the estimated net leverage ratio for 2025 is 34x EBITDAThe companys current credit rating is BBB which is one level below the companys target rating of BBB With a positive outlook from Fitch a rating upgrade may be imminentWith regard to its dividend the company has a juicy 91 yield which comes with strong free cash flow protection The company is expected to maintain a 13 free cash flow yield before a surge to 15 in 2025 Please note that free cash flow takes growth and maintenance capital spending into accountIn other words the dividend is safe not only because of a healthy balance sheet but also because the company is finally producing consistent free cash flowThis also helps the companys valuation After all a 91 yield is a huge deal Its the highest yield we discuss in this articleThe company is trading at just 74x NTM EBITDA which is below any of its peers While ET has a history of cutting its dividend it is now a much stronger player which warrants a higher valuationThe current consensus analyst price target is 17 This is 25 above the current priceGiven the bigger picture thats more than fairThe third midstream company is no MLP Enbridge is a Canadabased CCorp which means it does not issue a K1 formLike its American peer Energy Products Partners its one of the most reliable dividend payers in the industry The company has a track record of 28 consecutive annual dividend increases Since 2002 the dividend has been hiked by 12 per yearHowever in this case investors need to be aware that Enbridge pays its dividends in Canadian dollars which means dividend growth for foreign investors is dependent on the Canadian dollarThe company currently pays CAD 08875 per share per quarter which translates to a yield of 73Taking a step back Enbridge is a giant With a market cap of 72 billion the company is a giant in its industry connecting energy producers to customers in North America and EuropeHeadquartered in Calgary the company operates the worlds longest and most complex crude oil and liquids transportation system with more than 17800 miles of active pipelines in North AmericaEvery day the company delivers more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and liquids via its Mainline and Express networksThe company transports roughly 30 of total North American crude oil production 65 of USbound Canadian exports and 40 of total US crude oil importsNot only does this company have a massive moat but it also has a wellcovered dividendThis year the company is expected to generate 89 billion in free cash flow which results in a 91 free cash flow yield indicating an 80 cash payout ratio that supports the safety of the dividendOn top of that the company has a BBB credit rating and a highly favorable business modelFor example 98 of the companys anticipated 2023 EBITDA comes from regulated assets or longterm takeorpay contractsApproximately 51 of these assets fall under the takeorpay plus category These assets are backed by extended agreements with inflation protection and costsharing provisionsRoughly 47 of the EBITDA is characterized by low risk resembling utilitylike stability with minimal volatilityThe company also enjoys one of the strongest customer bases 95 of its customers have an investmentgrade rating meaning it is unlikely to suffer from bankrupt customers in the event of severe economic weaknessWhile this goes for many of its peers ENB is at the very top when it comes to benefiting from strong customersEnbridge is also growing through strategic investments For example the company aims to boost its market share in the Gulf Coasts LNG exports It targets a market share increase from 15 to 30 by 2030 making Enbridge one of the most important players in Americas plans to become a gotomarket for liquid natural gasThese growth programs are expected to provide the company with roughly 5 average annual compounding EBITDA growth in the 20222025 period boosted by toll escalators higher prices for pipeline usage organic expansions and growth projectsBear in mind that the company is growing without risking the safety of its dividend as the aforementioned free cash flow numbers account for maintenance and growth CapExHaving said that ENB isnt having a good year The stock is down 9 in New York Shares have lost a quarter of their value since the 2022 peakShares are now trading at 116x forward EBITDA As the valuation chart we discussed in the Energy Transfer part of this article showed its one of the most valuations However the company usually trades close to 16x EBITDA which reflects its stronger financials and growth potentialAnalysts currently give the stock a consensus price target of 43 which is 21 above the current priceThis is fair On a longerterm basis I expect higher and more consistent gains backed by consistent dividend growth and the benefit from growth investments in new energy projects like LNGIn todays world of complex financial decisions and everrising expenses its easy to feel overwhelmed But as I explored the world of Income for Life focusing on energy investments I found a way to simplify and secure my financial futureJust like my oneyearold grandson Asher who lives a carefree life without worrying about bills or news I realized that I dont need the added responsibility of managing commodities trading Instead Ive discovered a strategy that allows me to kick back and relax while still reaping the benefits of the energy sectors growthThree compelling picks stand outWhile these picks have different strengths they all promise dual profit potential stock price appreciation and dependable dividends In a world of uncertainties these energy investments offer a sense of security and the potential for financial freedomJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREIT Preferreds BDCs MLPs ETFs

134,Is U.S. Oil Production Surging?,Is US oil production surging I am certain that if you have been on Twitter lately you mustve seen a few people post pictures of how close US oil production is to the prepandemic highs You cant blame these people for buying into thatBut what people may not realize is that the EIA weekly US oil production figure has lagged behind the monthly production figures for almost a year Its funny that it has taken them this long to rebenchmarkNow before we begin its important to remind you of an important update the EIA did to US oil production tracking On August 31 we published a very important update on US oil production In thatTo make the long story short EIA pegged US oil production in June 2023 at 12844 million bd 634k bd was in transfers to crude oil supply ie blending and adjustment came in at 200k bdOur old formula for calculating real US oil production was as followsThe chart below shows how accurate we are at tracking US oil productionNow this is where things get tricky Because of EIAs attempt at being more transparent they are now in fact overestimating US crude production Why Because the adjustment came in at 200k bd and using our old methodology of calculating real supply US oil production in June really came in at 12644 million bdIf we circle this back to what we are seeing in our highfrequency tracking data we find the same conclusionTheres been no real surge in US oil production since March 2023In fact we can go one step further and look at associated gas productionNote We include adjustment in our production calculationFrom this dataset you can find the same conclusion Readers should ignore the noise from the weekly US oil production figures EIA STEO has US oil production growing to 132 million bd by yearend We dont see that happening As a result you will notice the EIA adjustment figure in the weekly report trend lower and lower Last week was a great example of that when the adjustment came in close to zeroAnother way to validate that we are correct about the US oil production assumption is by looking at the weekly EIA crude storage figure change relative to our estimate If EIA reports a figure more bearish than the one we published then it implies that production is surprising to the upside If EIA is more bullish then it implies that production is lower than our estimateHere is an example using next weeks estimateIf EIA reports a larger crude draw than our estimate then it is likely that US oil production is currently below 1275 million bd and vice versaGoing forward readers can use our estimate as a proxy for US oil production This is why we have spent so much time perfecting this methodologyUS oil production is not surging its flat Please ignore the EIA weekly US oil production figure It is not useful As long as you know that and look at what we say US oil production is you will have an edge over the rest of the marketThank you for reading this article We launched our oil trading portfolio in 2019 The oil trading portfolio is designed to take advantage of shortterm longshort oil and energy stock trades in the market For readers interested in our positioning along with realtime trades    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,48,2023-09-22,5
135,"Hedge fund bets on U.S. Treasury futures could trigger turmoil, BIS says",The increased use of heavily leveraged bets by some hedge funds against US Treasury futures while they go long US Treasurys poses a financial vulnerability worth monitoring because of the margin spirals it could potentially trigger the Bank of International Settlements said MondayUnwinding those leveraged short positions in US Treasury futures if disorderly has the potential to dislocate core fixed income markets the BIS said in its Quarterly ReviewIn recent months hedge funds have built up net short positions in US Treasury futures of about 600B with more than 40 the the net shorts concentrated in twoyear contracts Fernando Avalos and Vladyslav Sushko both senior economists at the BIS said in the reportA common trading strategy seeks to profit when Treasury futures are priced at a premium to the bonds theyre based on As such traders sell futures forward or establish short positions matched by bond purchases or long positions To bolster their profits on the very narrow price gap they use high amounts of leverage which means they commit very little of their own capital and borrow the restAvalos and Sushko note that investors often borrow cash in the repo market by posting their US Treasury holdings as collateral They pointed to similarities with the September 2019 repo market turmoil and the March 2020 bond market dislocation caused by the pandemic Recent evidence suggests that the same type of trade may be driving the current build up they The two economists described the mechanics used to leverage the futures forward sales and how that can lead to a margin spiral When entering a futures contract traders need to post initial margins in cash or highly liquid assets that the counterparty keeps as collateral Increased volatility in US Treasurys would increase the initial margin requirement causing the trader to post additional cash or to close their positions A disorderly reduction in margin leverage exacerbated fixed income market distress in both September 2019 and March 2020 with both episodes preceded by significant hikes in initial margins,32,2023-09-18,1
136,Largest Weekly U.S. Crude Storage Draw On Record And More To Come,You may not know this from the price action in oil today but EIA reported the largest weekly crude draw in history 17 million bblsThe drop also puts us inline withPreliminary figures show a build as US crude exports drop and imports reboundThis is not expected to be a trend Looking at Kpler tanker traffic over the coming weeks US crude exports are expected to remain elevated while US crude imports remain low This combined with flat US oil production is a recipe for much lower crude storageOur very early estimate shows US crude storage falling in line with 2022For readers the conclusion to reach is that the crude draw is only beginning Seasonally speaking US crude storage draws into midSeptember so this is not a surprise to the market But the magnitude of the draw will be a tailwind for the bullsFor the Saudis this is much needed in order to sustainably keep prices higher We think the Saudis will keep the voluntary cut of 1 million bd into November to ensure that any demand downside surprise will be coveredNow that weve covered the incoming US crude storage changes lets move on to the positives and negatives in the reportUS oil demand is not recovering as we expected In fact it is now moving in the opposite direction of what we expected While the weekly demand figures are by no means accurate of the bigger picture the directionality has been a good indicator As a result it is unlikely that we see US oil demand reach an alltime high this summerInterestingly gasoline demand which was a key tailwind going into the summer is now becoming a dragAnd if we overlap this with the monthly oil demand data we can see that gasoline demand has not been as strong as we had hoped forNow for those of you that say that weekly oil demand is garbage you have to realize that the monthly big 3 demand gasoline distillate and jet fuel have tracked closely with the directionality of the weekly figuresThe latest weakness in the big 3 is the result of weakness in gasoline and distillate Labor Day usually marks the peak for US gasoline demand so without an uptick in the following weeks it is very likely we do not see further improvements in those demand figuresAs for total US oil demand other oil has kept total demand elevated For those wondering what other oil entails EIA describes it asIn the coming weeks we will need to see US oil demand trend higher or else our assumption that WTI reaches 85 to 90 will have to be lowered Elevated refining margins and low product inventories suggest a tighter market condition than implied by EIAs demand figures so lets see what the data shows usOur latest highfrequency data puts US oil production around 126 million bd or slightly lower than the May production average of 1265 million bdTypically US oil production starts to meaningfully grow by the end of Q3 and into Q4 If we dont see similar momentum this time it implies that US oil production has already peaked for the year Given the rig count drop we think this is a very high possibilityDespite the weak demand we alluded to previously product storage remains low Gasoline storage is still at the lowest level over the last 5yearsDistillate storage remains lowAll things considered elevated refining margins continue and suggest to us that low storage levels are incentivizing refineries to increase throughput But with US refinery throughput stuck around 165 million bd and maintenance just a few weeks away refining margins are likely to remain elevated going forwardQ3 inventory draws are underway Next weeks EIA report will show a crude build but the following weeks will show material draws The trend has not changed This combined with flat US oil production and low product storage should continue to push oil prices higherHowever readers should note the weakness in US oil demand figures and we will want to see that rebound in order to keep pushing prices higherFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are interested we can help    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,30,2023-08-02,5
137,"USOI: Covered Call Oil Fund, 24% Yield",As per its prospectus The ETNs are senior unsecured obligations of Credit Suisse AG maturing April 24 2037 USOI isYou will notice that outside the top5 ETNs the fund assets amounts are very small For example the In the covered call funds world most names tend to systematically underperform their reference index Take for example equitiesThe Global X SP 500 Covered Call ETF  has spent the last year below the total return levels provided by the index itself That translates into investors being better off buying the SP 500 index outright versus XYLDThe story is different for oil and USOICovered call strategies are dependent on the implied volatility levels present in their respective markets Writing calls is only profitable from a riskreward perspective ie giving up a part of the upside when implied volatility is high and hence the option premium received is consistent In the equity space the VIX has plummeted to levels below 15 and represents a very unappealing place to short volatility In the oil space however volatility is markedly higherAlthough volatility as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index has come down substantially in the past year it is still above 30 This translates into option premiums received for writing calls being rich from a riskreward perspective As a personal rule of thumb for writing calls we would never do it for volatility levels below 25 It just does not payThe Seeking Alpha platform indicates a 24 dividend yield for USOIHowever do note that from a pure price perspective the ETN is mostly flat on the year The fund basically distributes the option premiums it makes on the written call portion premiums which can vary depending on the level of implied volatility and interest rates in the marketYou can see from the above historical table of paid dividends the close correlation with the oil implied volatility At the beginning of the year when implied volatility levels were high the fund paid very consistent monthly dividends The figures have come down as volatility has subsidedThe 24 figure the platform quotes is the trailing twelvemonth one please note TTM in the parenthesis which is obtained by adding the dividends for the past twelve months and dividing by the current fund price If volatility stays at current levels the dividend yield figure is going to come downThe fund is designed to follow a CS covered call oil indexAs per its definition the Index engages in the followingIn the definition above the Reference Oil Shares are shares of the In essence USOI sells monthly covered calls on USO that have a 6 upside only The ETN gives up any monthly moves in USO above 6 A slow steady increase in the price of oil is beneficial for USOI while violent moves both on the upside and downside lead to worseoff resultsAs a reminder USO holds WTI futures staggered across a number of maturity tenors in order to create a total return profile as closely correlated with spot WTI as possibleThe moves in USO this year have been ideal for USOI Oil has moved steadily both on the downside and upside thus creating an ideal environment for USOIs covered call strategy to harvest volatilityinduced premiums Please note from the above graphs that midyear when USO had 10 drawdown USOI did not breach a negative total return figure due to its call option premiumsAs we have described in a number of  as of late we are bullish oil into the year end feeling that it is well supported on the supply side by OPEC A rangebound or bullish oil outlook is positive for USOI setting it up to continue to outperform a pure oil fund like USO which experiences decay if oil prices stay putWe do not think we are going to have a recession this year and while going through a minor correction currently oil will continue to perform into December USOI is the best instrument outside pure equities to take advantage of that viewUSOI is an exchange traded note from Credit Suisse now UBS The fund provides for both the embedded return of an oilcovered call strategy and the default risk associated with the issuing entityThe ETN provides for a monthly 6 outofthemoney covered call writing strategy on the USO WTI oil fund USOI has done extremely well this year consistently outperforming USO and being up over 23 The fund disburses all the option premiums it makes hence while its price is fairly unchanged for the year its dividend yield is extremely highGiven the high level of implied volatility in the oil space we expect USOI to outperform USO into yearend with the ETN being a much better choice to express a range bound or bullish view on oil We are therefore a Buy for the name for the remainder of 2023 taking advantage of the current shallow correction in oil prices

138,SCHD: An Even Worse Income Investment Than When I First Said 'Sell',Its almost seven months since I issued a SELL recommendation for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF  in an article titled You can see below how SCHD hasSince my February call even with its dividends SCHD has delivered shareholders a total return loss of 208 This is particularly painful because had investors taken my advice in midFebruary and bought Treasuries instead of SCHD they could have locked in a 1 year 4354 yield free of state taxes If they had built a ladder they could have done even better as there were 6 month Treasury bills available back then paying 5 And then IIf you are investing in a retirement account its obvious that a yield of 4354 or higher is a better deal than the 332 SCHD was yielding as of last February They suffered the full brunt of the loss of NAV and an inferior dividend which will compound at a slower rate than the income from a higheryielding TreasuryInvestors investing in taxable accounts argue that SCHDs dividends arent taxed as harshly as the interest income from a Treasury That is true but a favorably taxed unrealized  of over 2 does not compare well with a taxed gain over 4And to add insult to injury even after suffering the decline in share price shareholders holding it in a taxable account would have still had to pay both Federal and State taxes on its dividend so which would further decrease SCHDs already negative total returnEven if SCHDs price had not deteriorated investors would have still been earning less income from SCHDs dividend than they would have received from Treasuries bought when I issued that Sell call Back in February SCHDs yield was reported to be 332 However had you bought SCHD at its closing price on Feb 16 2022 the day my article was published your actual yield through the first six months of the year would have been less SCHD closed at 7675 per share on February 16 and has so far this year paid out 12612share This annualizes out to a yield of 329 on a cost of 7675For investors in a taxable account the big advantage of receiving income from stocks instead of bonds or CDs is that qualified dividend income is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income For a single investor whose taxable income is below 41675 or a married couple whose taxable income is below 83351 there is no tax on qualified dividends at all But investors with taxable income below those levels will be paying at most only a 12 Federal tax on earned InterestThe 1 year Treasury yielding 4354 taxed at 12 still leaves you with a 382 yield on your investment which is far better than what they received from SCHDs 332 yield And the Treasurys interest is not taxable by state or local authorities but SCHDs dividends areEven a well off retiree with enough income to land in the middling tax bracket that begins when income exceeds that 41675 for a single person or 83351 for a couple and who is paying a marginal tax rate of 24 on ordinary interest may have done better with that 1 year Treasury bill After paying the 24 tax the Treasury it was still putting a 331 yield in their pocket not the 329 SCHD actually paid out And SCHDs 331 dividend would have been taxed at 15 by the IRS leaving them with an after tax yield of only 281 If the investor lived in a state that has an income tax that yield would have been decreased further by state taxes which the Treasury escapesPast results dont necessarily tell you what will happen with money you invest now Its possible SCHDs price could shoot up delivering a superb total return But is it likely Lets look at the conditions in which you are going to be investing your money todayAs I argued in my February article SCHD performed as well as it did because it had only begun trading in 2011 which is when the Federal Reserves Quantitative Tightening QE policy had forced interest rates to the historic lows they maintained for the next decade The rates of quality dividend paying stocks were far higher than available Treasury or CD rates until 2022 This caused investors who were investing for income to bid up the prices of those quality dividend stocks which are what SCHD invests in so that they not only received a higher income yield they saw gratifying capital gainsThroughout that period the US market as a whole was experiencing a dramatic relentless bull market especially the large cap part of it Remember SCHD is market cap weighted and its fate is largely determined by the fortunes of the top 10 or so largest stocks it holdsAs you can see from the chart below from its inception SCHDs price has risen and fluctuated very much in sync with the broader largecap market as exemplified by the SP 500 That said over its entire lifetime it has underperformed the SP 500 because its methodology screens out aggressive growth stock and it was those stocks especially the big Tech stocks that drove much of the SP 500s dramatic growth The consistent dividend growing stocks that SCHD screens for tend to be mature companies whose earnings growth prospects are modestIn the chart below you can see how SCHDs total return moved in very much the same pattern as did the SP 500 I use the Vanguard SP 500 ETF  to stand for the SP 500 for this comparison purposes as it was back in 2011 the cheapest investable form of the SP 500 available to investorsThe bull market we see graphed above ended with the advent of The Great Inflation V2 in 2022 The Great Inflation V1 occurred from 1973 to 1982 which I remember clearly but many of you reading this were too young to noticeThis is what has happened to VOO and SCHD since inflation kicked in in January of 2022As you can see SCHD still mostly fluctuated in sync with VOO Though it did not lose as much as VOO did in the decline that bottomed out in October of 2022 it did see its NAV drop significantly in 2022 It also did not recover as sharply as did VOO in 2022 From this we can see that when the market hits hard times SCHDs dividend stocks can be expected to lose value tooThere is only one period we can see in this chart where SCHD did not move in lock step with VOO That was in the period after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank  that occurred on March 10 2023 on SCHDs net asset valueAs I warned in my March article  because of its focus on dividends SCHD holds a high percentage of banks and financial institutions They have recovered over the short term since the SVB debacle thanks to the Fed taking extraordinary measures But if you follow banking news you will know that there are significant rumblings pointing to oncoming problems in the Banking sector with troubled commercial property loans and rising consumer credit card defaults raising warnings Further pressure on banks will definitely be reflected in SCHDs price at least until its next reconfiguration in March of 2024 when it has the opportunity to dump some of its bank stocksSCHDs yield is not competitive right now because inflation is still a factor And it is going to continue to be a factor for a lot longer than most investors currently believeDespite a lot of wishful thinking by talking heads who want you to buy stocks because that is what makes  money the Fed has signaled repeatedly that it is not going to be lowering rates any time soon and may very well be raising them Inflation looked like it was slowing for the past month or so but it looked like it was slowing in the Mid1970s only to roar back after the Fed began easingPowell has stated numerous times in the speeches he gives after each FOMC meeting that the Fed will hold rates at their current level until it has a lot more data convincing it that inflation has dropped to its 2 target and will remain thereTypically his conferences focus on a single phrase or two defining it as hawkish or dovish without listening to the more nuanced points that Powell makes I have listened to all of them this year and what I have heard has guided my investing much to my satisfaction Because the Fed has made it very clear that they will take their time bringing rates down Instead they are doing what was traditional until QE keeping rates a point or two  currently reported inflation rates That is what they mean when they use the term restrictiveAnd the Fed has made it clear that they are looking at many months worth of data before declaring victory over inflation And that is where the challenge lies Because two very troubling factors right now make it likely that inflation will turn out not to be tamed after allOne is the strong persistence of the employment data The Federal Reserve is legally bound to do two things control inflation and support employment The unemployment rate which you can see broken out by states in this Bureau of Labor Statistics  is at a level that is in many states an alltime lowThe other issue is the price of oil which has surged 24 since July thanks to the actions of our supposed allies the SaudisA sustained rise in the price of crude oil will echo through the entire economy Most people understand that while rising oil prices might make some money for shareholders in oil stocks it raises the price of transporting the goods manufactured by most other companies and also raises the price that the majority of consumers who are not rich enough to buy EVs must pay to drive to work shop and leave home for entertainment It also raises the price of heating in rural regions where oil heat is still the normBut many dont understand that there is  reason that a rise in the price of oil will affect consumer prices crude oil is refined into the petrochemicals used to make  too Plastics are a major component of everything from appliances automobiles siding tech devices and packagingIt takes a couple months for the rising price of oil to show up in the prices of good but it is already affecting how much consumers can spend given the increases they are seeing at the pumpThe Fed governors whatever you might wish to believe are not stupid Nor are they driven by the political agendas that drives so much of the news reporting you absorb They see the factors that make it likely that inflation will persist and they will use the very limited tool set at their disposal to control it Their main tool is the ability to raise the Federal Funds rate They are not legally mandated to help the government deal with its debt despite what may hear from political partisans This means rates may very well rise another point at least over the next few months and then settle at that higher rate to remain restrictiveThe CPI will be reported Weds Sept 13 2023 and it will be tempting to look only at the core CPI which doesnt include food and energy especially if it declines But the consumers ability to pay for anything else after paying for food heat and transportation can be very limited if those noncore food and energy prices riseFinally if inflation persists it is quite possible that the market will enter the doldrums as it did the last time inflation was a factor in the 1960sInvestors who have only been investing in stocks during the past decade have been lulled into a belief that the market will of course drop from time to time But this only provides a nice buying opportunity The past decade has taught investors to expect stock prices to quickly revive and reach new highs This has not always been the caseAs you can see from the chart below the market has experienced long periods when stocks drop and then meander around trading in a range for a decade or moreMost online graphs displayed by brokers and sites such as this one only show you the price and total return of the SP 500 going back to at most the 1990s But the market has been trading far longer than thatIn this chart  you see depicted the SP 500 index price since 1927 Its historical data is inflationadjusted using the headline CPI and each data point represents the monthend closing valueThe red lines I have added show you the periods when it took a very long time for the SP 500 to recover its value after a sharp decline The three periods highlighted are 1937  1954 1968  1993 and 2000  2015Throughout all these periods Treasuries provided a much better return than stocksAs I write this on the afternoon of September 12 my brokerage Schwab is offering the following yields on CDs and US TreasuriesThe smallest amount that will buy you a Treasury bond or CD in at Schwab is 1000 If you have a smaller amount to invest you can get a yield of 524 from Schwabs Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund  The yield on Vanguards Federal Money Market Fund  is 527 These money market funds are taxed by state and local authorities and their yields fluctuate weekly so if you can buy a longer term investment you have a better chance of locking in a good rate But they are a great place to accumulate the funds you will be able to use to buy Treasuries or CDsI currently am not enthusiastic about brokered CDs for retirees despite their higher prices because they are extremely hard to get out of You will have to offer a price that results in a yield that is much higher than the current market rate to be able sell one if you need to get your money out before it matures Treasuries are very liquid and you can sell them easily if needed at a price that reflects the current market rate So while they will let you lock in excellent longer rates do not invest in brokered CDs with any money you might ever need during the term of the investment They are however suitable for younger investors retirement accountsMany of you reading here will be thinking that your yield on cost from purchases made years ago are higher than what you see here But that is a faulty way of thinking By leaving your money in SCHD you are for all practical purposes investing that money today at todays yield And unlike the case with Treasuries the yield on your investment is not guaranteed nor are you guaranteed to receive the money you invested at some set time If we go into a prolonged period of decline followed by plateau like the periods highlighted above you may deeply regret having counted on your fleeting capital gainsThen too if the economy suffers and company earnings contract dividends may be cut or eliminated If the prices of stocks decline dramatically executives may decide to put some of their profits into buying back share of their stock at lower prices instead of paying out dividends If dividend investing goes out of fashionand it has been very faddy over the last decade the stocks that SCHD has to choose from because of the way its rigid index methodology must pick stocks may decline in qualityFinally remember that the only reason the prices of the stocks making up SCHD will rise is if investors are willing to pay more for their shares than they cost now You may be a devoted dividend investor with a large investment in SCHD which skews your perspective we hate hearing bad news about the stocks we hold as they can challenge our sense that we can trust our decisionsSo you may be attached to your investment in SCHD But those retirees and incomeseekers who arent already sitting with a lot of money invested in SCHD s arent dumb They look at recent results They see how much better and safer those Treasury rates are than the yields of questionable dividend stocks They will invest accordinglyThe flow of assets into SCHD is already far less than it was during the years when Treasuries offered a 25 yield on your money The chart below shows this Keep an eye on it You may see those flows reverse if rates remain at their current levelsIf you have a huge capital gain in SCHD in a taxable account you will have to analyze how a sale would affect your overall tax picture At a minimum you might consider not reinvesting dividends and investing those dividends and any new money you have to invest in safer fixed incomeIf you hold SCHD in a retirement fund this might be a great time to take profits and invest the capital you receive in a safer higheryielding Treasury that will compound at a far higher rate than SCHD with no threat to your invested capitalInvesting in inflationary times is very different from what we have experienced for many decades SCHD was a fine investment when inflation was not a factor and rates were forced down to historical lows Those days are over Retirees fortunately now have a much safer way of generating income at a rate slightly higher than current inflation while protecting their hard won nest eggs  I am not a certified investing

141,"2 Champs, 1 Winner: Energy Transfer's 9% Yield Beats Enterprise Products' 7% Yield", and  are two of the best Master Limited Partnerships on the market The two giants are the backbone of Americas energy infrastructure and valuable sources of income and capital gainsI have covered both in the past EPD in this coproduced  and ET in this  and like both as longterm investmentsHowever given recent developments EPD is yielding only 7 while ET can still be bought at a 9 yieldIn this article Ill share my thoughts on two similar yet different stocks and explain which one I would be buying if I could only own oneSo lets get to itOn a side note please note that both companies operate in the midstream energy industry which means they connect producers ofBoth EPD and ET benefit from throughput fees which makes cash flows reliable and both stocks good income tools MLPs are not necessarily a bet on higher energy prices Thats what upstream companies are forBoth ET and EPD issue K1 forms which means taxes are shifted from the corporation to its unitholdersPlease make sure to be aware of what this could mean for your portfolio before buyingAlso bear in mind that shares are called units Dividends are called distributionsIn this article I may use both although its not technically correctEnterprise Products Partners always makes me think of a Toyota Corolla According to multiple  its one of the most reliable cars ever built Its not fancy and its not fast but it sure gets the job done which is to get its owners from A to B and back without unexpected costs annoying breakdowns and whatnotA few years ago people got a good laugh out of a  from CraigslistSo why does this remind me of EPDLike the average car EPD and its peers are dealing with many uncertainties and costs In the Midstream industry thats mainly demand fears and high investment requirementsFor example over the past ten years the Alerian MLP ETF  has returned just 10  including dividendsThis poor performance is due to a number of steep selloffs that were caused by demand fears hitting skyhigh investment requirementsSince the Great Financial Crisis the American energy industry has required a ton of new pipelines to facilitate rapidly rising oil and gas production export facilities and the production of related chemicalsAs building pipelines is expensive most MLPs and CCorp midstream companies used debt to fill funding gaps as operating cash flows were often not enough to deal with capital expenditures  let alone dividendsEnergy Transfer is one of these companies but more on that in a bitEnterprise Products Partners has a large network consisting of more than 50 thousand miles of pipelines more than 260 million barrels of liquids storage 20 deepwater docks 30 natural gas processing plants and 26 fractionatorsThese assets connect producers of fossil fuels to buyers and turn these products into valueadded products They also facilitate exports which is increasingly important in a world where the US allies rely on its energy exports for example caused by the war in UkraineOn top of that there are a number of things that make EPD very specialAs of 2Q23 the company has a total debt principal outstanding of approximately 289 billion with a weighted average life of the debt portfolio at 20 years and a weighted average cost of debt at 46Around 97 of the debt is fixedrate The consolidated liquidity at quarterend was approximately 4 billion which includes both availability under credit facilities and unrestricted cashThe aforementioned leverage ratio of 30x aligns with their target range of 275x to 325xAs a result in the past four quarters the company has distributed 57 of its operating cash flow to shareholders CapEx accounted for less than 40EPD also has a track record of consistent dividenddistribution growth The company has hiked its dividend for 25 consecutive years making it the only MLP with a dividend aristocrat track recordEven better the dividend has consistently been covered by distributable cash flows allowing the company to hike its dividend even in 20152016 and during the pandemic when most of its peers were cutting dividendsJust like the Corolla of the Craigslist ad it didnt matter to EPD how much trouble its industry was in Oil price crashes demand fears a major pandemic political fears wars and more didnt keep EPD from sustainably raising its dividendThis has allowed EPD to consistently outperform its peers as shown by the YCharts chart earlier in this articleCurrently EPD yields 73 The 5year distribution CAGR is 28 which means that dividend growth is barely above the Feds 2 inflation targetValuationwise the stock is trading at 77x operating cash flow which is below its normalized valuation of 107x OCF Next year OCF is expected to grow by 2 followed by 4 growth in 2025This paves the road for consistent lowsingledigit dividend growth and its backed by 41 billion in projects under constructionThese projects include a natural gas pipeline expansion a cryogenic natural gas processing plant an NGL fractionator and the PDH 2 plant in Chambers CountyThe company also announced plans for three new natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and the first phase of the Texas Western products pipelineThese projects will significantly expand their capacity and valueadded servicesThe current consensus price target is 32 which is 16 above its current price I believe its a fair targetIn general I really like EPD Its reliable a source of elevated income and undervaluedHowever it may not be the best play on the marketIf EPD is a Corolla ET is that car you almost totaled but managed to fix a few times As the chart below shows excluding dividendsdistributions ET lost 90 of its value during the 2016 commodity crash It revisited these lows during the pandemicIt also cut its dividend during the pandemicOverall ET wasnt a great place to beThat has changedExcluding the Crestwood merger the company has a massive footprint in the United States which includes 14300 miles of crude oil pipelines a million barrels of daily Permian crude oil takeaway capacity and pipelines to other major basins like BakkenThe company also has eight fractionators close to 6000 miles of NGL pipelines and more than 54 thousand miles of gathering pipelines with almost 12 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity making it a giant in the natural gas industryNow ET is a much healthier more mature corporationIt could be a future CorollaIn August the companys credit rating was upgraded to BBB which means its now an investmentgrade rating Its leverage ratio is expected to be at the lower end of the 445x target range and its CapEx requirements are dropping allowing the company to boost free cash flowLooking at the table below we see that the company is expected to generate 62 billion in free cash flow this year which would translate to 14 of the companys market capBear in mind that free cash flow is operating cash flow after all capital expendituresThis would mean that theres a path to doubledigit dividends down the roadIn the second quarter Energy Transfer announced a quarterly cash distribution of 031 per common unit an increase from the 023 paid in 2Q22The company maintains its goal of achieving a 3 to 5 annual distribution growth rate while managing leverage reduction enhancing equity returns and ensuring sufficient cash flow for investment in its growth opportunitiesThis month the company hiked by 08 to 03125 which translates to a yield of 89Going forward the company is acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners in a 71 billion deal that wouldnt affect its credit and add a business with more than 85 feebased income to its portfolioMeanwhile the companys Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals continue to benefit from the increasing demand for ethane and LPG products with plans to expand NGL export capacity at NederlandAdditionally the company is considering an optimization project at the Marcus Hook terminalIn the Delaware Basin several processing plants have been placed into service supported by customer commitmentsThe Gulf Run pipeline connecting gasproducing regions to LNG export markets is nearing full subscription causing discussions about capacity expansionAll of this supports lowtomidsingledigit longterm operating cash flow growth which makes the company attractiveDue to past troubles the company has a more attractive valuation than most peersET is trading at just 75x forward EBITDAThe current consensus price target is 1730 which is 24 above its current priceThanks to the mix of a strong business a juicy wellprotected dividend yield and an attractive valuation ET has turned into an outperformerSince 2011 ET has consistently outperformed the AMLP ETF and the dividend aristocrat EPDGiven the attractive valuation and massively improved business I expect that ET will continue to outperform which is why I would rather buy it than EPDNeedless to say this is not a call to get people out of EPD I respect EPDs business a lot I just have to say that the riskreward of ET is still better even after two years of outperformanceWhen comparing Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners I find myself leaning toward ET as the more attractive investment choiceWhile EPD is like the reliable Toyota Corolla of the MLP world offering a steady 73 yield and consistent dividend growth ET has transformed from a troubled past to a more mature promising optionET boasts a healthier financial profile with an investmentgrade rating and a path to doubledigit dividendsWith a current yield of 89 and strong business growth prospects it has consistently outperformed its peers since the pandemic which I expect to lastThis is not to downplay the merits of EPD which is reliable incomegenerating and undervalued However the riskreward balance seems to tilt in favor of ET making it my preferred choice in this

oil rallied as OPEC cut production citing Chinese economic weaknessThe rally ran out of upside steam at just over 95 per barrel falling to 8150 on October 6 The October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel ended the correction and crude oil was back above the 88 per barrel level on October 19 War in the Middle East caused supply fears for the energy commodity that powers the worldSince 2016 when crude oil prices fell below the 30 per barrel level Russia has cooperated with the international oil cartel coordinating production policies and turning OPEC into OPEC Over the past seven years production decisions have resulted from negotiations between Riyadh Saudi Arabia and Moscow Meanwhile the Biden administrations policies addressing climate change by supporting alternative and renewable fuels and inhibiting US fossil fuel output and consumption handed pricing power to the cartel Cool relations between Washington and Saudi Arabia and the incendiary relationship between Washington and Moscow have only increased OPECs desire to keep oil prices highSaudi Arabia needs an 80 per barrel oil price to balance its domestic budget Russia depends on oil revenues to fund its ongoing war in Ukraine Moreover Russia uses commodity production as an economic weapon against countries supporting UkraineThe US used its SPR to reduce oil prices after Russias invasion pushing prices over 130 per barrel When prices fell to the administrations 6772 target range the Department of Energy only purchased four million barrels after selling more than a quarter of a billion since early 2022 With oil prices heading higher and the US SPR at 3513 million barrels the US has far fewer barrels to address rising oil prices than it did in March 2022Aside from crude oil and oil products natural gas prices have

143,Baytex Energy Offers Big Upside And A Growing Dividend But Beware Of The Risks,  isnt an obvious energy income investment It currently pays a 009 per share dividend on its stock which generates a 16 yield Thats not even inAt the moment BTE shares dont reflect this possibility so investors seeking income generated from higher oil prices could consider buying them now in anticipation of a higher dividendIn recent weeks BTE transitioned to paying out 50 of its free cash flow for debt repayment and 50 in a mix of dividends and share repurchases We estimate that at current oil prices BTE generates a 30 free cash flowAt oil prices above US80 per barrel WTI  we expect BTE to pay out 025 per share annually as a dividend which would generate a 45 yield on the current share price As the remaining free cash flow is used to repurchase shares the number of shares outstanding will decline over time and free cash flow per share will increase Consequently BTEs capacity to pay dividends on a pershare basis can grow as long as WTI remains above US80 per barrel and BTE shares remain undervalued by the marketFrom a capital appreciation standpoint BTE shares offer multibagger potential due to the huge amount of free cash flow generated at higher oil prices Our price target for the shares is 950 representing a 73 upside from the current priceThe challenge in analyzing the investment merits of BTE equity lies in the companys Eagle Ford assets The longterm economics of depleting shale assets is receiving more attention and investors have to be comfortable with the prospects for BTEs shale acreage to continue generating free cash flow Particular attention must be paid to the longevity of the assets reserves and the sustainability of their current production mix We address both issues in this articleBTE is a Canadiandomiciled oilandgas EP that derives half its revenues from several oilrich basins in Alberta and Saskatchewan and half from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas Its assets are shown in the BTE shares have been well known among Canadian oil investors for the companys tremendous cash flow torque to higher oil prices As oil prices increase its cash flows grow more rapidly than most of its peers Of course the flip side is that as oil prices decline BTEs cash flow falls more rapidlyOn February 28 BTE  it would acquire Ranger Oil for C34 billion US25 billion In the deal BTE paid Ranger shareholders 749 BTE shares plus US1331 in cash for each Ranger share which represented a premium of 74 to Rangers closing stock price the previous day BTE also assumed Rangers debtTo finance the deal BTE paid 7328 million in cash and issued 3114 million new BTE shares valued at 13 billion or 426 per share The newly issued shares increased BTEs share count by 54 It funded the cash portion through borrowings on its credit facility a twoyear term loan and the issuance of 800 million senior secured notes due 2030 The deal closed on June 20 2023The deal was transformative to BTE After it closed the companys Eagle Ford acreage was comprised of two largely contiguous blocks allowing for optimal development and lower costs per barrel  shows that its acreage is located primarily in the oily part of the Eagle Ford play depicted in greenThe deal has clear benefits for BTE shareholders It modestly extends the companys provedplusprobable reserve life for oil natural gas and NLGs by approximately one year to 12 years It also boosts the oil weighting of BTEs Eagle Ford productionThe before and after pro forma metrics for BTEs Eagle Ford acreage are shown belowImportantly the acquisition increases the percentage of Eagle Ford production that BTE operates With greater control over its Eagle Ford operations management can drill at its own pace and work to improve drilling techniques Weve heard an unsubstantiatedthough we believe credibleclaim that BTEs management believes it can improve the productivity of the legacy Ranger acreage through its operatorship of the property CEO Eric Greager was previously the CEO of Civitas Resources  a Coloradobased shale EP No doubt his experience can prove valuable in optimizing BTEs Eagle Ford drilling Improved productivity holds the potential for improving shareholder returns and turning the Ranger deal into a bargain purchaseThe deal improves BTEs realized crude oil pricing by enhancing its access to the US Gulf Coast while it increases BTEs light oil production in its total production mix Light oil near the Gulf Coast fetches a US2 per barrel premium over WTIAs part of the deal management pledged to increase the amount of capital BTE will return to shareholders The company had not paid a dividend since 2015 in order to focus on debt reduction After the deal BTE shifted to allocate free cash flow on a 5050 mix between debt reduction and dividendsshare repurchases It instituted an annual dividend of 009 per share which equates to a 16 yield at BTEs current market priceManagement instituted a new debt target of 15 billion Once it reduces debt to that level it will transition to paying out 75 of free cash flow in the form of dividends andor share repurchases Management has guided to production growth of 3 to 5 over the next few yearsDespite these positives investors panned the deal since it was announced After a shortlived rally BTEs stock declined by more than 25 over the ensuing months Only recently has it recovered to its predeal price in the mid5 range Over the same timeframe the major Canadian EP index the iShares SPTSX Energy Index ETF  is up 121BTEs price action since the deal begs the question of whether the market perceives problems with the Ranger assets The main contenders would be issues relating to Rangers reserve life and the sustainability of its production mix between crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and dry natural gasShareholders could have extrapolated production trends ongoing in the greater Eagle Ford to BTEs future production For instance Eagle Ford production peaked in 2015 and has since declined by 60 BTE should have no problem maintaining its production over at least the next five years Its oil reserves are substantial while future extensions to its proved reserves should allow it to replace a significant percentage of produced reservesPerhaps more concerning for Eagle Ford oil producers is the increasing percentage of natural gas relative to oil in the basins production The gastooil ratio has climbed since oil production peaked in 2015 as shown in the Since natural gas is a lowervalue product than crude oil an increasing percentage of gas in a production mix can hurt an EPs financial results If investors began to suspect that an EPs production was about to get gassier they would send its shares sharply lower The same would happen with BTETo investigate the prospects for BTEs acreage becoming gassier we looked into the asset quality of Ranger Oils predecessor companies Penn Virginia and Lonestar ResourcesThe legacy Penn Virginia assets are superior to BTEs legacy acreage due to their relatively high oil cut of more than 70 and their low operating costs Fortunately these assets represented roughly 60 of Ranger Oils reserves Penn Virginias production and reserves both demonstrated stable oil weighting over many years and its current reserves imply it can continue to do soWere more concerned about the legacy Lonestar Resources acreage These assets are inferior to BTEs legacy Eagle Ford assetsLonestar initially targeted natural gas and NGLs for development For years prior to its acquisition by Penn Virginia it had grown its natural gas production rapidly to prove up its acreage Year after year most of its discoveries and extensions were of natural gas Then in 2016 Lonestar purchased oilweighted assets from a defunct Sanchez Energy The deal increased the oil weighting of Lonestars reserves and production But the increase only proved temporary Despite the Sanchez asset acquisition in the following years Lonestars production and reserves became progressively gassierThese are the assets at greatest risk of exhibiting increasing gas content Fortunately they only represent 20 of BTEs Eagle Ford reserves We therefore dont see them as an obstacle for BTE to maintain its oil weighting over the next five yearsOn balance we believe the Ranger acquisition improves BTEs prospects for maintaining its Eagle Ford production as well as the oil weighting of its production mix We consider it to be a net positive for longterm shareholder valueWe dont believe the decline in BTEs stock is attributable to real or perceived problems with Rangers assets or production prospects Rather it was likely due to BTEs decision to take on debt to finance the acquisition The new debt increased the risk to shareholders amid an oilprice downturn In addition investors were probably disappointed by the companys new capital allocation plan which calls for allocating 50 of free cash flow to dividends and share repurchases In doing so it will reduce the pace of debt reduction just after the company tripled its net debt balanceAnother negative that may have caused the stocks swoon was the large number of shares that BTE issued at a severe discount to its intrinsic value in order to fund the acquisition of assets of arguably lesser quality The deal also limited BTEs ability to benefit from todays high oil prices due to its requirement to hedge 40 of its oil exposure for 12 months to secure financing on acceptable termsLastly the market may have drawn ominous parallels to BTEs disastrous acquisition of Aurora Oil and Gas in 2014 at the top of the previous cycle That deal saddled BTE with onerous debt obligations that put its equity at risk for the next six yearsWe value BTE shares in the range of 850 to 1050 Our price target is the midpoint of the range or 950 which implies a 727 upside from the stocks current price of 550We value BTE from two perspectives the free cash flow yield on its equity at a given oil price and the discounted cash flow net to shareholders over the companys life All our valuations assume that the AECO natural gas price is 250 per mcf and that the WTIWCS differential is 1650Turning first to the free cash flow yield the results for BTE are nothing short of spectacular The shares possess tremendous free cash flow torque to higher oil prices The table below shows the amount of free cash flow the company generates at different oil pricesUsing a generous 12 free cash flow yield for valuation purposes at US85 per barrel WTI our estimates imply that BTE shares offer 112 upsideWith regard to BTEs free cash flow downside we estimate that free cash flow goes to zero at US5833 per barrel WTIBTEs free cash flow yield is relevant for income investors because the company is currently allocating 50 of its free cash flow to a combination of dividends and share repurchases If it allocated half of the 50 of free cash flow to share repurchases and paid out the other half to a common dividenda portion of which will be fixed and the remainder variablethe company would pay an annual dividend of 035 per share with WTI was sustained at US85 per barrel The stock would yield an attractive 63 in such a scenario The significant amount of share repurchases underway in such a scenario would rapidly shrink the number of shares outstanding increasing free cash flow per share for the remaining shareholders and leading to larger dividend payouts per share in the futureWe estimate that with oil at 80 and the company allocating 50 of free cash flow toward debt reduction it will reach its 15 billion net debt target in two years and one quarter That timing shrinks to one year and three quarters at 85 per barrel and to one year and a half at 90 per barrel Once BTE has achieved its debt target it will pay out 75 of its free cash flow to shareholdersTurning to discounted cash flow valuations our conservative scenario assumes that oil remains at 80 per barrel and that BTE increases production by 3 through 2028 and then keeps production flat thereafter It also slashes BTEs terminal value by twothirds to account for the possibility that the companys production declines or becomes gassier after year 10 All our scenarios employ a 12 discount rate and a WTIWCS differential of 1650This valuation implies the shares are worth 868 representing 58 upside from their current price of 550To further address the risk of BTEs production becoming gassier our next scenario illustrates what BTEs free cash flow would look like with WTI at US80 per barrel but with BTE producing 75 liquids35 of which is heavy 45 of which is light and 20 of which is NGLsand 25 natural gas These assumptions are in contrast to our estimate that BTE will produce 844 liquidsof which we assume 595 is light crude 260 is heavy crude and 145 is NGLsand 156 natural gas This severe scenario implies that the shares are appropriately valuedIncidentally BTEs current free cash flow yield using these assumptions stands at 143Of course this scenario wont actually occur but it illustrates what would have to happen to the companys production mix to justify its current stock priceThe next discounted cash flow implies that BTE shares currently discount US7332 per barrel WTI a far cry from todays price of more than 90 per barrelOur bullish scenario values BTE shares with WTI sustained at US85 per barrel This scenario reduces the terminal value by half It values BTE at 978 implying 78 upsideFor more extreme scenarios we dont consider in our value range or price target for BTE shares at US90 per barrel WTI our discounted cash flow valuation implies the shares are worth 1162 representing 111 upside from their current price of 550 At US100 per barrel WTI we value the shares at 1528 implying 178 upside Both valuations use a 12 discount rate and cut BTEs terminal value in halfClearly all the reasonable valuations imply significant upside for BTE shares The valuations based on free cash flow multiples indicate multibagger potential And our discounted cash flow scenarios that incorporate a 12 discount rate and reduce the terminal value illustrate the substantial upsideBaytex Energy Corp has emerged from its Ranger acquisition with its operations split 5050 between the Eagle Ford shale and various oilweighted plays in Canada which include some of the most economic locations in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin The companys operational risks stem primarily from its Eagle Ford acreage so we dedicated most of our analysis to the region Over at least the next three years we expect BTEs Eagle Ford results to exhibit flat production and a stable commodity mix Meanwhile its Canadian production growth will drive companywide production growth of 3to5 per year in line with managements guidanceOur BTE valuation and price target point to 727 upside from the current price In fact the shares possess upside potential at WTI prices greater than US73 per barrelWere less confident about BTEs production more than three years out For this reason we currently wouldnt recommend investing in the shares for more than a threeyear holding periodInvestors must be careful to balance BTEs potential returns with its risks For one investors should be wary of the downside of BTEs torque to oil prices Operating leverage works both ways cash flow grows rapidly as oil prices march higher but it also shrinks rapidly as prices fall BTEs debt load and reduced free cash flow at lower oil prices will significantly increase its risk to shareholders if prices fall below US65 per barrel WTI Due to this risk investors who prioritize the safety of the principal and seek to avoid permanent capital losses at sustained low oil prices should avoid the name in favor of more conservative EP holdings Even investors who wish to own BTE for the next few years should only make the shares a small part of their investment portfolio due to the risk of loss if WTI falls below US65 per barrel for more than a yearInvestors who can bear these risks in mind should consider BTE shares for their explosive upside amid current oil prices and for their potential over the coming quarters for paying a large and growing dividendAt HFIR Energy Income we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation

145,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,"There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spend higher than average amounts of takehome pay on gasoline The drain created by gasoline price increases may have increased the number of residents who defaulted on the mortgages that backed the securities whose failure led to the PanicNow that we are no longer major importers of oil it is still possible for world oil prices to increase and for that to increase US gasoline prices But there is an important difference In 2007 the money being spent to buy more expensive imported oil was going overseas and in some cases was not easily recycled into the US economy If we had a major price increase today as we had in 2022 the money would stay in the US economy and go to higher royalty payments higher tax collections in oilproducing states and localities increased CAPEX by oil producers and increased dividend payments to owners of US oil companies This immediate recycling of funds within the US economy may have the effect of reducing the negative impact of higher oil prices on growth and reducing the danger of a deep recession This may be a factor although certainly not the only factor in the surprising resilience of the US economy in the current cycleIt should be noted that the US economy can still be impacted by a cutoff in oil imports or a massive increase in the world oil price While we are net exporters the petroleum market is complex and we still import crude and export refined products Refineries are generally set up to refine certain types of crude and transportation economics often leads to imports in one part of the country and exports in another part Due to this complexity an abrupt cessation of oil imports would be disruptive and it would take time and expense to adjust But the degree of disruption would pale in comparison with the impact we would have suffered in 2007Now that the US is actually a net exporter of energy rather than an importer an increase in energy prices will tend to reduce the US trade deficit rather than increase it This would tend to strengthen the dollar Most of our trading partners are actually net importers so their currencies may be negatively impacted by higher oil prices The net effect in the long term may be a stronger dollar which tends to reduce inflationary pressuresThe fact that the dollar is not likely to be negatively affected by the rollercoaster of oil prices although competing major currencies the euro or the yuan may suffer negative effects is likely to cement the dollar in place as the global reserve currencyThe fact that we are no longer dependent upon oil imports will likely enhance our national security In the 20th century oil was a major factor in the cause and the course of World War 2 Our oil independence may give us more leverage in confronting various oilexporting countries including Russia The Strategic Petroleum Reserve  originally set up to ensure that our military would have access to oil in the event of a cutoff of imports  now does not really need to serve that purpose Instead it can be used to cushion the market from price fluctuations and also to generate profits simply by buying at low prices and selling at high prices The Biden Administration seems to have adopted this policyAs noted above the petroleum market is complex and we should take measures to protect ourselves against the disruption that an abrupt cutoff would entail It is also the case that many of our allies are net importers and we would try to help cushion the impact upon them by increasing our exports if their imports were disrupted But  again  the impact of an import disruption upon us from a national security perspective today would be sharply reduced from the impact we would have suffered in 2007The above factors lead to certain conclusions from the perspective of investment They definitely make investment in the US more attractive than investment in markets which would be subject to severe impact from higher oil prices or an oil import disruption The enhanced resilience of the dollar makes investment in dollardenominated assets comparatively attractiveThe US energy sector also becomes more interesting because of its ability to serve as a source of exports

148,Enterprise Products Partners: The Highest-Quality 8%-Yielding Wide Moat MLP,The energy sector is highly complex It consists of so many fundamental influences and industries that its easy to lose track  especially when looking for something specificEssentially the energy industry consists of three major partsAs the overview below shows upstream companies are the ones that produce natural gas and crude oil which is the basis for a wide range of products including gasoline diesel and various chemicalsThe companies turning raw products into finished products are refiners However in order for these companies to get access to feedstock midstream companies are needed These companies provide storage and pipelines to ship ie oil to refineriesThe finished products are then shipped to the end customer using midstreamHaving said that upstream midstream and downstream all have pros and consInvestors looking to capitalize on rising oil and gas prices are better off buying upstream companies as these companies have revenue streams tied to the price of commoditiesRefiners are dependent on the crack spread which is the profit margin of refiners that buy oil to turn it into diesel gasoline and other products These companies also are price sensitive just different from upstream companiesMidstream companies are the most boring companies  but in a good wayThese companies are dependent on the amount of product flowing through their pipelines and contract prices Most companies also have takeorpay contracts which allow them to generate revenue regardless of whether customers use their pipelinesThe benefit is that cash flows tend to come with very low volatility which is great for dividend safety The drawdown is that investors do not benefit from a potentially steep increase in commodity prices On the flip side investors also do not suffer if prices dropThe biggest risk is a scenario where commodity prices are so depressed that upstream companies are likely to reduce output This could hurt volumes for midstream companies The same goes for weak enduser demandWhile I cannot make the case that midstream companies are without risks they come with a great riskreward given high average dividend yields and above all very wide moat business models After all its extremely expensive to build a pipeline and terminal networkOnce companies have a network in place they quickly turn into cash cows is such a companyThis company may be one of the best in the business It has a history of stock price outperformance a toptier balance sheet loads of free cash flow thanks to a mature business model a juicy yield and a moat that can be seen from spaceIn this article Ill walk you through my thoughts as I make the case that EPD is among the best highyield midstream companies money can buyAs one of Americas largest pipeline and terminal operators EPD isnt unbiased However it makes a compelling case for a strong future of fossil fuelsFor example EPD makes the case that energy usage is essential to improve the UN Human Development Index This index covers life expectancy education and economic wealthAs we can see in the overview below the higher the Human Development Index the higher the demand for energyWhile at some point energy efficiency becomes key as more energy doesnt improve the Human Development Index anymore between roughly 150 and 200 Gigajoules per capita its fair to say that the development of economies is based on energy demandIts why coal production was so important during the industrial revolution as it allowed the US and other Western nations to start building wealthy economies While were now at a point where renewables are increasingly important our wealth is built on coal oil and gasHence EPD puts a big question mark in the chart below as theres no way we can achieve Paris Climate Agreement targets in a scenario where the global population growth until 2050 is expected to be 18 billionIn light of these developments the United States is the place to be The United States enjoys some of the biggest oil and gas reserves in the world a massive infrastructure network allowing it to produce and export these reserves and stocklisted companies that allow investors to benefit from thisLooking at the chart below oil gas and related liquids production is expected to see consistent growth albeit at lower growth rates compared to prepandemic levels Thats why Im also bullish on upstream but thats something well discuss in another articleAdditionally the US will be an increasingly important export nation for crude oil natural gas ethane LPG and relatedEPD has highlighted domestic demand versus total supply in the charts below Note that by 2030 the US will also be able to boost LNG liquid natural gas exports to more than 40 billion cubic feet per day In 2021 that number was 11 billionHaving said all of this rising energy production higher export demand and longterm tailwinds for fossil fuels are fertile ground for EPDFounded in 1968 EPD is one of the oldest MLPs in the United States With a market cap of 58 billion its also one of the biggestIn this case its age is a huge advantage The company is mature which means it has an established network of pipelines and terminals without the requirement to spend a lot on growth capital expendituresWhen dealing with midstream companies I usually advise people to go with mature companies as these are often able to pay dividends without having to borrow moneyLooking at the map below we see that the company has a network of more than 50000 miles of pipelines more than 260 million barrels of storage 20 deep water docks 30 natural gas processing plants and 26 fractionatorsOver the past 12 months EPD spent 27 billion on capex This is a combination of growth and maintenance capexThis number has been wellbelow prepandemic levels when the company had to consistently invest more in its business to grow itNow it benefits from strong and rising operating cash flow from past growth investments and subdued investment requirementsBefore 2017 the company didnt generate a lot of free cash flow Now its generating more than 4 billion in annual free cash flowThis number is expected to gradually increase to 65 billion by 2025 which would translate to more than 11 of its market capAs a result of these qualities the company has a 30x leverage ratio which is extremely healthy Hence it has an ABaa1 credit rating one of the best ratings in the industryFurthermoreFurthermore unlike many peers that had to cut their dividends when a toxic mix of falling energy prices and high capex needs hit them in 20152016 EPD has hiked its dividend for 25 consecutive yearsAlso looking at the numbers below the company has a wellcovered dividend and selffunded capex Its now a healthy cash cow with tremendous dividend potential thanks to an expected doubledigit free cash flow yield after 2024These qualities have also allowed EPD to outperform its peers Over the past 10 years EPD shares have returned 71 including dividends The Alerian MLP ETF  returned just 7When looking at our rating tracker we see that the company enjoys the highest quality score in the industry which is no surprise given what we have discussed so farValuation wise were dealing with an attractive opportunityThe company is trading at 89x 2024E EBITDA which is based on its market cap roughly 10 billion in minority interest income streams it doesnt fully own 275 billion in expected net debt and 97 billion in potential EBITDAThis valuation is attractive as EPD tends to trade close to 10x EBITDAThis would give the company a fair value 18 above the current unit priceThe current consensus price target is 32 which is 20 above the current price making my outlook a consensus outlookHaving said all of this I expect EPD to outperform most of its peers on a prolonged basis The company has the perfect lowrisk business model strong demand and supply tailwinds a healthy balance sheet selffunded operations and a wellcovered dividendOn top of that its juicy 75 yield comes with a great valuation making EPD a terrific tool for incomeseeking investorsEnterprise Products Partners stands out as an exceptional player in the midstream industryWith a rich history extensive infrastructure and a rocksolid balance sheet EPDs appeal is undeniable Fueled by rising energy demand export potential and a mature business model EPD boasts remarkable financialsGenerating substantial free cash flow maintaining a robust dividend growth history and possessing a conservative debt profile EPD promises a steady income stream and substantial growth potentialEPDs strategic position in the energy landscape and its juicy 75 yield make it a standout choice for incomeoriented investorsThe companys lowrisk highreward business model supported by favorable supply and demand dynamics paints a promising picture for the futureAs a seasoned player with a

151,Is 6%-Yielding ONEOK An Unbeatable S&P 500 Income Play?,Earlier this week the 10year government bond yielded 50 the highest number since 2007While rates have come down a bit since then it shouldnt surprise anyone when I say that were in an environment of elevatedEven worse as I discussed in a recent  the market expects rates to remain elevated The implied chances that the Federal Reserve funds rate is above 450 on November 7 2024 has risen to more than 80 During the summer that number was roughly 0When adding elevated inflation it makes sense that people are seeking higher yields on their investmentsAlthough its tough to compare dividend growth stocks to bonds one has a steadily growing payout the other hasnt I cannot disagree with investors who make the case that they require a higher yield in this environmentThe bottom line is that cash flowdependent investors need a higher yieldThats where  comes in one of the few midstream companies that is a CCorp meaning investors do not have to deal with K1 formsThe company makes the case that its the most attractive highyield stock in the SP 500 which we will discuss in greater detail in this articleSo lets get to itMaking the case that ONEOK is the best highyielding SP 500 stock is quite a statementONEOK has done itIn a recent investor presentation the company made the case that its the best highyield stock in the SP 500 based on a number of criteriaWhat the company has done here is fully legit However Im not a fan of including the ESG score in this process I also dont like excluding companies smaller than 20 billion I would have gone with a 5 to 10 billion cutoff but thats my preferenceNonetheless the company isnt deceiving usI also made a screener to prove thatHere are the criteria that I usedMy findings showed five companies Three of them are REITs where the focus is NOT on earnings due to the importance of depreciation of assets and other factorsSo yes It is fair to say that based on a few key criteria OKE is indeed one of the best highyield plays on the marketThe problem is that a lot depends on yearonyear EPS growth Thats a very specific number It excludes all companies that are seeing temporary dips It includes companies that might benefit from a temporary improvementWhat we need are players with consistent growth which is why we need to take a closer lookOKEs stock price returns are not very consistent The company has been through a number of very volatile cyclesOver the past ten years OKE shares have returned 161 including dividends This performance beats the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF  and the energy sector Unfortunately investors have been through two massive selloffs In 20142016 slower growth expectations caused investors to flee the midstream industry as mass defaults were feared These fears did not materializeIn 2020 the stock sold off as demand for fossil fuels imploded due to lockdownsSince then the company has made a strong comeback supported by demand growth and increasing safety and stabilityThe good news is that despite stock price volatility the OKE dividend hasnt been cut in more than 25 years Since 2000 the dividend has been raised by 12 per year making it one of the few companies in the SP 500 that offers a yield over 5OKE currently pays a 0955 dividend per share per quarter This translates to a 57 yield Its protected by a 70 payout ratioIn 2025 the company is expected to generate 35 billion in free cash flow which would translate to a 9 free cash flow yield paving the road to consistent dividend growth with support from buybacksFurthermore the company benefits from the stability that comes with the midstream industry Unlike oil and gas producers OKE relies on volumes not necessarily commodity pricingIt allowed the company to consistently grow its EBITDA despite severe oil price volatility over the past ten years EBITDA has grown by 12 per year in the 20132022 period Please note that 2023 expectations exclude the merger with Magellan Midstream PartnersWhen adding the  merger with Magellan the company turns into one of the bestdiversified midstream players in North AmericaThe combined company has a 50thousandmile network with 44 natural gas liquids exposure It has 21 exposure in refined products 18 gathering and processing exposure and 7 crude oil exposureFurthermore ONEOK and Magellan are actively exploring opportunities in batching blending and bundlingThese strategies aim to optimize the use of existing assets with the potential for considerable operational synergiesFurthermore ONEOK anticipates minimal capital needs in the short term to capture the outlined synergies with some projects requiring little to no investmentAs they progress they might explore lowreturn projects followed by higherreturn projects for expanding and extending their systems into new marketsThe synergydriven capital allocation strategy aligns with their goal of achieving quality scale and high returnsOKE which has an investmentgrade balance sheet with a BBB rating and a sub4x 2024E EBITDA net leverage ratio is attractively valuedOKE is trading at just 126x adjusted earnings Its longerterm valuation is 194x earnings thats the blue line The company has consistently traded at a premium before the pandemic as earnings were low and the market was betting on better results down the roadThat has happened Now OKE is trading at a discountIf the company returns to its valuation it has the potential to return 26 per year through 2025 Thats not necessarily a prediction just a theoretical assessment based on a fair valuation multiple and expected growth rates seen in the lower part of the chart aboveEven a 15x multiple would technically speaking lead to a 15 annual return over the next three yearsThe current consensus price target is 69 which is 4 above the current priceWith these numbers in mind we need to take them with a grain of salt I believe that a fair price target of 75 12 above the current price is warranted In the years ahead I expect the company to return at least 10 to 12 including its dividendInvestors looking for midstream exposure without having to invest in companies with an MLP structure may benefit from buying OKE It has a great yield a stellar business with synergy opportunities and a high probability of morethandecent returns over the next few yearsThe only thing investors need to keep in mind is that OKE like all of its peers is volatile Be aware of these risks when assessing a suitable position sizeIn todays environment of rising bond yields and persistent inflation ONEOK shines as a highyield investment optionWith a dividend yield of 57 and a solid financial track record OKE offers compelling reasons to be considered one of the best highyield stocks in the SP 500OKEs strengths include its investmentgrade rating substantial market cap and an AAA ESG rating although the latter may be subjectiveWhat sets OKE apart is its remarkable consistency The company hasnt cut its dividend in over 25 years and with a 70 payout ratio and projected 9 free cash flow yield in 2025 its wellpositioned for sustained dividend growthMoreover OKEs diversification and merger with

152,These 15 Stocks Have Exhibited The Highest Correlation With Oil Prices Over The Last Month,By Andrew ProchnowAs the RussoUkrainian war continues to unfold in Eastern Europe another tragic incident occurred on October 7 when terrorists from the Gaza Strip executed a heinous surprise assault on Israel While the geopolitical consequences of this event areIsrael and the Gaza Strip are not significant crude oil exporters themselves but the broader Middle East region plays a pivotal role as a supplier of global energy resources Its worth noting that estimates indicate the Middle East holds up to 48 of the worlds proven crude oil reserves Consequently the recent escalation between Israel and Palestine presents a threat to global energy markets as it has the potential to trigger a chain reaction of violence in other parts of the regionCurrently a major concern is the potential involvement of Iran in the hostilities which could ensnare other Middle Eastern countries Many experts have suggested that Iran may have supported the terrorist organization Hamas in planning and preparing for the recent attacks on Israel Regardless of the veracity of these claims tensions could rapidly escalate between these historical adversariesThe primary and most pressing concern at the moment is the potential for further loss of life especially among innocent civilians Beyond that there is the risk that Iran may attempt to disrupt the global economy by obstructing traffic in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz This waterway is critical as it lies at the only passage between the Persian Gulf and the open sea Estimates indicate that approximately 33 of the worlds liquefied natural gas and roughly 25 of the worlds total annual oil consumption pass through this crucial waterwayUnfortunately global energy markets are exceptionally vulnerable at this juncture due to the disruptions stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine This means that any additional supply shocks could introduce significant chaos and undoubtedly inject fresh volatility into the prices of crude oil natural gas and other key commoditiesThe heightened risk of further market disruptions helps to explain the recent 18 jump in the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index OVX over the last five days and the more than 60 increase over the past monthCrude oil has been one of the most dynamic commodities in the market in 2023 surging from 70 per barrel to 95 per barrel a 35 increase between July 1 and September 30 However oil prices corrected in early October dropping to as low as 82 per barrel In the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel oil prices rebounded above 85 per barrel and are currently trading around 86 per barrelOn Oct 9 which was the first business day following the unexpected attacks on Israel over the weekend most of the energy sector showed an upward movement in line with the rising crude oil prices Many energy stocks closely followed the trend in crude oilOn Monday oil prices rallied by about 5 The list below highlights the energy stocks making the biggest moves in the immediate aftermath of the recent Hamas attacks on IsraelSome of the above symbols also appear on the list of stocks exhibiting the highest positive correlation with oil prices over the last 30 days Listed below are the 15 stocks sharing the highest correlation with   over the last month and their associated correlation coefficientsJust as a reminder when two assets exhibit a positive correlation meaning they tend to move in the same direction the correlation value falls within the range of 0 to 1 On the other hand when two assets are negatively correlated indicating they move in opposite directions the correlation falls between 1 and 0Correlations are typically classified as nonexistent weak semistrong or strong depending on the extent to which the two assets are linked For instance a correlation of 015 might be considered a weak positive correlation while a correlation of 075 could be termed a strong positive correlation Conversely a correlation of 020 might be categorized as a weak negative correlation while a correlation of 080 could be described as a strong negative correlationAs a result the oil stocks mentioned earlier with correlation coefficients exceeding 070 all share a relatively strong correlation with oil prices or more precisely with the United States Oil Fund Its important to note that the oilfocused volatility gauge the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index is also closely linked to options activity in USOBeyond trading crude oil based on its price direction which involves going long or short investors and traders in the energy sector can also engage in trading crude oil based on its volatilityThe CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index monitors volatility in the crude oil market much like the CBOE Volatility Index tracks volatility in the SP 500 The OVX offers a realtime estimate of the expected 30day volatility in the crude oil market using options associated with the United States Oil Fund Interpreting the OVX is relatively straightforward because its mechanics closely resemble those of the VIXFor example if crude oil is trading at 100 per barrel an OVX reading of 20 would suggest that over the next 12 months crude oil prices are expected to settle within a range between 80 and 120 which is 20 of 100 or 20 with a 68 degree of confidence Additionally this example would imply that crude oil is expected to trade within a range of 60 to 140 with a 95 degree of confidence or between 40 and 160 with a 997 degree of confidence over the next 12 monthsCurrently the OVX is trading around 40 and has fluctuated within a range of approximately 23 to 60 over the past 52 weeks In the last five days the OVX has surged by about 18 rising from 33 to nearly 40During the past 30 days the OVX has witnessed a remarkable 60 increase due to the sharp correction in oil prices in early October leading to heightened volatility ahead of the October 8 attacks on IsraelThe highest point ever recorded for the OVX occurred in March 2020 when it soared to 190 during the onset of the COVID19 pandemic as illustrated belowAs most market participants are well aware In the trading world  refers to the tendency of financial instruments to move toward their average price over time Historical data has demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that Investors and traders frequently engage in buying or selling volatility based on their perception of its relative value To illustrate consider a scenario in which the 30day historical volatility of stock XYZ stands at 20 while the implied volatility marketbased volatility for options with a oneyear duration is priced at 30 In this situation there exists a theoretical opportunity to sell options in stock XYZ with the expectation that actual volatility will be lower than what the market is pricingSuppose an investor or trader opts to sell options with a volatility level of 30 while the underlying stock XYZ historically moves with a volatility of 20 In such a case this position theoretically generates a profitWhile most investors and traders keep an eye on the VIX to assess potential options and volatility prospects the OVX proves equally valuable when exploring volatilityfocused opportunities within the oil sectorCurrently the OVX is trading below its longterm median which typically hovers around 68 Nevertheless considering that the OVX has traded within the range of 24 to 60 over the past 52 weeks the present reading of 3940 is reasonably close to the OVXs recent midpoint rangeIn the future investors and traders might consider adding the OVX to their watchlists to monitor and capitalize on potential opportunities in the crude oil sector stemming from ongoing developments in Eastern Europe and the Middle EastTo pinpoint specific opportunities market participants can refer to metrics like Implied Volatility Rank IV Rank which gauges whether implied volatility is high or low for a specific underlying asset based on a years worth of implied volatility data For instance if a hypothetical stock XYZ witnessed implied volatility fluctuating between 30 and 60 over the past year and the current implied volatility stands at 45 XYZ would have an IV Rank of 50 If the implied volatility is presently trading at 60 for XYZ the IV Rank would reach 100Volatility traders often consider selling options or volatility when the IV Rank exceeds 50 although the specific threshold can vary depending on individual outlook and risk toleranceOptions sales within the realm of the oil sector may become more enticing if the OVX continues to climb surpassing milestones such as its 52week high of 60 or even rising beyond its longterm median of 68Luckbox

153,"Magellan Midstream: Overvalued, But Hold For Solid Dividend Yield",Magellan Midstream Partners  deals in crude oil and refined petroleum products The company has a remarkable history of consistent dividend payouts which makes it an attractive stock to hold in a portfolio to reduce theMMP is a partnership firm that mainly engages in the storage transportation and distribution of crude oil  refined petroleum products in Tulsa Okla The company conducts its business in two operating segments  The Refined Products segment consists of a pipeline system of around 9800mile refined petroleum products including 54 terminals and 2 marine storage terminals This pipeline covers a 15state area starting from the Texas Gulf Coast and also linked with other interstate pipelinesMMP has recently reported its financial results for the  The company reported revenue of 8772 million which is increase of 1123 from 7886 million in Q2FY22 This growth was mainly fueled by a decent increase in both transportation and product sales revenues Refined Products segment revenues surged by 1165 and Crude Oil segment revenues declined by 502 compared to the previous years same period MMP reported net income of 2387 million which is dramatic decrease of 3255 compared to 3539 million in the Q2FY22 Decreased net income resulted in diluted net income per share of 118 compared to 167 in the same quarter of the previous year It reported distributable cash flows of 312 million up 3684 compared to 228 million in Q2FY22 Free cash flows stood at 271 million The firm reported cash and cash equivalents of 1284 millionThe energy industry experienced a significant downturn during the pandemic and the growth was later hampered by the supply chain obstacles arising from the geopolitical issues of Russia and Ukraine However it is observed that the industry is rebounding significantly and experiencing rapid growth in demand estimates for 2023 and 2024 have been raised by 130 kbd and 90 kbd respectively to 825 mbd and 835 mbd which reflects a positive growth factor for the participants operating in this industry Identifying these growth opportunities the company is highly focused on expanding its refined products pipeline which can significantly help it to cater to the rapidly growing demand and capture the additional market share by expanding its profit margins The company is working extensively to complete the 30000 barrelperday expansion of its refined products pipeline to El Paso Texas The new 16inch 30mile pipe between Odessa and Crane Texas has been completed with enhanced operational storage to meet incremental shipments presently under construction I think that this development can considerably assist the firm in establishing a strong position in a competitive market and increasing its access to the countrys refining capacity I believe these expansions can potentially help the company to increase its cash flows and further increase its dividend payout The companys future growth may be anticipated to be stable due to favorable industry trends and its expansion plans It has also provided its guidance for the third quarter and FY23 which represents an optimistic outlook for the companys growth It forecasts the annual EPS to be around 505 In addition it projects the third quarter can be 115 per share Distributable cash flow is estimated to reach 126 billion in the current fiscal year I think the companys estimates are correct looking at the current growth factorsThe firm has experienced 21 years of continuous dividend growth which indicates its healthy market position The company paid a cash dividend of 10375 in each of the first three quarters of 2022 and 10475 in the fourth which accounted for a total annual payout of 416 per share and a dividend yield of 648 It distributed a 10475 dividend in each of the first three quarters of the current fiscal year and given the companys strong cash positions and growth prospects I believe it can maintain its quarterly dividend of 10475 in the last quarter as well representing a high dividend yield of 653 I think this attractive dividend can help investors to mitigate the risk arising from recessionary pressuresThe company highly depends on refineries gathering systems and petroleum pipelines owned by third parties to supply its assets If the quantity or quality of this crude oil production changes or if there are any disruptions in the throughput on these pipelines and gathering systems due to reasons such as line repair testing competitive forces and other weatherrelated causes it can negatively affect the companys operations and reduce its shipments These disruptions might also limit its cash flows by further contracting its profit marginsThe demand has rebounded in the industry in the current year and I believe the company is also wellposition to cater to the growing demand as it is constantly focused on expanding its pipeline system After considering all the above factors I am estimating EPS of 507 for FY2023 which gives the forward PE ratio of 1264x share price 6410 After comparing the forward PE ratio of 1264x with the sector median of 1150x we can say that the company is overvalued ONEOK is planning to acquire MMP at 6750 per unit which is a 53 premium compared to the current share price However the companys impressive dividend payout makes it an attractive opportunity for investors to protect their portfolios in these recessionary times The company has tremendous growth potential due to favorable industry trends and its vigorous expansion activities It is exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions which can further contract its profit margins The stock is overvalued at the current share price however its attractive dividend yield makes it an attractive stock to hold in the portfolio to mitigate the recessionary impacts on the portfolio After considering all the above factors I assign a hold rating to

155,My View On Wall Street: I Assess The Pros And Cons,"The SP 500 has declined about 95 since I last published the Equity Market PROs and CONs report on July 28th At the end of July investors were flying high as the major indices had put in an impressiveWe closed out another losing month in September and set sail into Q4 and now well revisit the PROs and CONS that are on the scene today In this report the  128  with 2 issues that I consider NeutralThe last two months of trading in the market have been difficult for the BULLS The major averages peaked in late Julyearly August and have been trending lower everInvestor sentiment took forever to turn bullish this year ironically it turned earlier this summer just in time for equities to peak and pull back in August and September This typical contrarian indicator worked again Now its back to bearish for investors The Bespoke Investor Sentiment Composite is negative once again and CNNs Fear  Greed Index is registering Fear right now Since the sentiment is contrarian excess bearishness is considered BullishSeasonality was a Con in my last PROs and CONs report and unfortunately for the BULLS it didnt disappoint August and September weakness for equities held to form this year but now seasonality moves back into the PRO column as Q4 is typically the best time of year for stocks As shown below in the snapshot from the Bespoke Seasonality Tool the upcoming 3month period has been the very best 3month period of the year for stocks over the last ten yearsThe 100th percentile for gains is certainly bullishCore inflation has come down and is showing signs of stability Supercore inflation is deflating slower but still making progress While inflation isnt DEAD the stock market by its price action after the last report believes the peak is definitely in and is ready to deal with current readings for a while longerInitial jobless claims have steadied while employment growth has slowed Primeage employment remains just shy of a recordhigh share of the population While job openings have declined indicating weaker labor demand the level remains very high compared to historical readingsConsumers still have lots of cash on their balance sheets even relative to much stronger consumer spending relative to prepandemic While savings rates are low consumer borrowing is wellcovered by income and households can keep spending at a healthy if slowly moderating pace for some time When consumers have jobs they will continue to spend In addition Corporations are not about to give up the employees they had a hard time acquiring after the pandemic That keeps the labor situation tightA range of manufacturing industries are rapidly adding factory capacity in response to recent industrial policy CHIPS BIL IRA Construction on factories is running north of 200bn per year with hundreds of billions more in spending to come At the same time the housing market is still short of inventory and will be for years to come Finally infrastructure spending has accelerated sharply thanks to fiscal policy and is not showing any signs of slowing down Its a doubleedged sword Good news for select sectors of the economy but it also keeps Debt and Inflation elevatedDuring the 2022 bear market rolling 12month forward earnings estimates fell 65 from peak to trough Since then they have recovered almost the entire decline Of course analysts tend to lag the market and estimates only started getting cut well after the 2022 bear market was underway Still underlying earnings are in good shape Recent results have also started to turn more positive The EPS beat rate fell from its historic postCOVID surge but over the last few months has ramped back up again A similar more modest recovery in guidance raise rates is also taking placeThe equity market thrives on themes and AI has been the markets theme in a big way for most of this year Theres a good chance this becomes a  rather than  wave Over the long term that is bullish for equities Every week there seems to be some new technology in the AI space introduced and search interest for AI topics remains elevated and trending higherThe only question is when will real money hit the bottom lineOutside of the megacaps in the SP 500 it has been a flat year for the market So even though the capweighted SP 500 is still showing a 10 YTD gain things arent nearly as rosy underneath the surface The median SP 500 stock is flat while the median stock in the smallcap Russell 2000 is solidly in the red at 7 That doesnt look like the new BULL market backdrop that the majority says it is As the week ended I now see ALL of the indices barely above their Long term trendlines This equity market  is living on the edgeMain Street media always talk about the 2year10year Treasury Yield curve The Fed also watches another metric The 3month10year Treasury yield curve has now been inverted for a record 222 consecutive trading days The curve reached its maximum point of inversion in early May at 183 basis points and has steepened to its current level of 75 Given that it has been nearly a year since the curve first inverted and the economy still appears to be steady theres a growing consensus that the current signal has been a false alarmBut dont dismiss the yield curve too quickly As shown in the table below historically the average number of days between when the yield curve first inverts to the start of a recession is 589 daysFrom the time the yield curve bottoms to the start of a recession the average is 395 days Based on these two figures a recession in the second half of 2024 would fit right within the averagesThe Leading Economic Indicators index published by the Conference Board takes a range of different economic and financial market data points into account and creates a single index that tends to deteriorate before recessions and recover before activity bottoms As shown in the chart  In other words if we dont see a recession following this run of data it will be an unprecedented resultThe Leading Indicators have fallen for 18 consecutive months Only two other periods have seen longer streaks of decline the mid1970s recession and the global financial crisisThere is a consensus view that the FOMC is near its terminal rate or close to it However the message we heard this week from Chair Powell is  Its HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut  then that means the economy is falling off a cliff That too is pretty scary The Fed is in a box and along with the market is facing a loselose situationHome prices have surged thanks to a mismatch between supply and demand High mortgage rates mean existing homeowners are unwilling to surrender extremely low rates further restricting supplyThose high mortgage rates also damage affordability driven by high prices When combined affordability has hit the worst levels since the 1980s with the average nonmanagerial worker needing to pay the equivalent of 867 hours of wages to cover the mortgage payment for the median existing home assuming 5 down And down payments are increasingly difficult to save up given high pricesThe shock to the banking system delivered late last year and early this year has largely been digested by the market However leading indicators of bank credit suggest a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank lending over the next yearThe SLOOS Senior Loan Officer Outlook Survey asks lenders whether they are seeing higher or lower demand for credit as well as whether they are raising or lowering the standards they underwrite to As shown in the chart below the reported demand for credit and the reported credit standards suggest that commercial  industrial CI loan growth is set to slow dramaticallyDeclining credit outstanding would only do bad things for the economic backdropThe terrorist attack in Israel highlights another US policy error From a financial point of view that brings the country into another conflict The US debt issue was highlighted in last weeks MACRO update It appears the US is now supporting two wars Ukraine and now Israel along with the continuing overhang of the ChinaTaiwan situation come at a time when the US finds itself in the  since WWII This country has never been more stretched and vulnerable and at some point this will have a serious impact on the MACRO economic scene At some point the market sniffs this MACRO issue as the serious threat that it isTwo years ago we could look at an SP 500 PE ratio in the high teens or even 20 and say that at least interest rates were low Bespoke Investment group On a trailing basis the SP 500 trades for 206 times earnings and while that is far from a record it ranks in the 83rd percentile relative to all other readings in the postWWII era Comparing the earnings yield of the SP 500 inverse of the PE ratio to the yield on the 10year US Treasury the current spread of 025 percentage points is the lowest since 2010While the market is expensive the key driver of the valuation stems from the largest stocks in the index As shown below the 10largest stocks in the index which account for 32 of the SP 500 trade for a median of 317 times earnings with four stocks trading for over 65 times earningsMeanwhile the median multiple of the remaining 490 stocks is 20 times trailing earnings That was OK when interest rates were zero but at 5 we are in a different backdrop that typically takes PE ratios downThis CON has been on the list since the beginning of the year yet stocks have risen As mentioned earlier the SP 500s earnings yield relative to Treasury yields and real rates is at its lowest levels in decades meaning stocks are less attractive relative to riskfree rates The SP 500s dividend yield was more than 100 basis points higher than the 2year Treasury yield two years ago  There is an alternative to stocks again As uncertainty ramps higher investors will reach for riskfree yield All of that cash that many analysts and BULLS say is on the sidelines and will go into stocks seems more like a Hope trade Those analysts are living in the pastWhile inflation readings have come down dramatically over the last year the June Year overyear reading of 29 might be as good as it gets in the near term Huge monthovermonth increases in CPI in early 2022 are now removed from the yy CPI tally which will make it harder for CPI to continue lower in the coming months unless we see outright deflation which is not currently projected Investors expecting the yy CPI number to continue lower may be surprised to see it keep ticking higher up towards 354 through yearend and beyond The latest PCE report confirms that inflation is still hanging on and any further progress will be SLOWFrom the October 2022 peak through the July 14th bottom the broad tradeweighted dollar fell 84 Over the last three months it has risen close to 4 Since 1973 largerthantypical dollar rallies have led to lowerthantypical SP 500 returns As long as the dollar is strong its doubtful the stock market will take off in a big way Of course the inverse statement is also true a reversal lower in the dollar would set up a positive backdropThe bull markets uptrend from the October 2022 low has been celebrated but as I have continually pointed out the nearterm technicals do not look good They still have a lot to prove before I can BUY into the New BULL market sceneWeve seen  since the market made its high for the year on the last day of July For this negative technical action to turn well need indices to break above their early September highsThe results of all five of the regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys for September were released Altogether regional Fed surveys have shown that manufacturing activity improved slightly in September The PRO crowd will claim that we have seen the bottom and improvement is on its wayThe folks that present the Bearish argument say Show me They point out that after two years of declines the net readings are still in contraction territory The fact that stocks hit such extreme oversold levels towards the end of September  a notoriously weak time of year for stocks  is a PRO in the minds of an optimist as there is a tendency for prices to revert when they get this overdoneFurthermore Treasury yields the dollar and oil are all at extremes to the upside at the same time It doesnt take much for a big reversal to occur when things get this onesided That is true BUT extreme conditions can last for longer than an investor wants to believe Hoping for a change in direction is a bad strategyThis time around there are some distinct changes on the list In July the standout on the PRO side was the trend reversal resulting in a BULL market backdrop that I said trumped just about all of the negatives This time around we see that has changed again as many indices and the DJIA along with the Russell 2000 are back in a BEAR backdropOn the CON side the TARA argument is still there and it has started to impact the market especially when uncertainty ramps up There is plenty of cash on the sidelines but probabilities suggest a lot of that cash wont make it into equities due to the riskfree alternatives This is one of the reasons I do not see another riproaring BULL market leg to new alltime highs on the horizon The Earnings forecast is the one issue to watch and  It is a fluid situation that can change quickly At the end of the day that will control what happens in the very near term After I put the report together I came away with the feeling that the PROs are centered around the nearterm prospects while many of the CONs speak to the MACRO viewLast weeks selling pressure bled over to Mondays open with the SP establishing a new intraday low during this correction However buyers emerged and the SP rebounded to post a modest sevenpoint loss The price action was typical for a market that is trying to find a bottom Intraday rallies dissipate and there is plenty of choppy price action The NASDAQ snapped a 4day losing streak with a modest gain No such luck for the other indices The SP extended its daily losing streak to 5 with the DJIA and Russell 2000 establishing 4 straight days of lossesMore choppy trading on Tuesday was eventually resolved to the upside something we havent seen in a while All major indices and every sector posted gains for the day as investors celebrated another Turnaround TuesdayThe party ended there for the BULLS The combined losses for the SP 500 in the last 3 days of trading tallied 3 While the NASDAQ

unlikely but a different OPEC member may see an easing of US sanctions This week the White House signaled that  That decision was based promise of freer elections in a dictatorship regimeHowever the fundamental problem with Venezuelas oil industrywhose production has fallen to a level lower than that of the UKis not pressure from sanctions Rather the issue is that many skilled workers of the national oil company have fled the country amid recordsetting inflation and political chaos Likewise following the past decades nationalizationconfiscation of energy assets owned by some international companies it is difficult to imagine them wanting to returnTherefore it is doubtful that any supply from this dictatorship will have any impact on the global energy scene Given this action it appears

156,Hess Midstream Looks Well Positioned For 2024,Back  I placed a Buy rating on Hess Midstream  saying it offered an intriguing mix of safety and income for investors At the time I thought the company should see solid growth as its parent oilAs a refresher HESM operates midstream assets in the Bakken and Three Forks shale plays in North Dakota serving primarily oil major HES About 50 of its EBITDA comes from its gathering business where it gathers natural gas NGLs and crude oil The segment also has water gathering and disposal pipelinesApproximately 40 of HESMs EBITDA comes from its Processing  Storage segment whose assets include processing plants and NGL storage facilities The restHESM gets virtually all its revenue from feebased contracts which generally have CPI escalators that are capped at 3 The company also get minimum volume commitments MVCs that are set on rolling 3year basisHESM turned in steady Q2 results with adjusted EBITDA rising 2 to 2481 million from 2426 million a year agoHigher interest rates however weighed on net income and distributable cash flow DCF Net income fell nearly 3 to 1479 million while DCF was lower by nearly 2 to 2026 millionThe company paid out a 601 cent dividend during the quarter with a coverage ratio of 14xAdjusted free cash flow was 1543 million as it spent 483 million in growth Capex It had 143 million in FCF after dividends for the quarterHESM saw its throughput volumes increase across all its products both year over year and sequentially Gas gathering volumes jumped 19 year over year to 369 MCFd while crude gathering volumes rose 7 to 94 bod Gas processing volumes climbed 23 Crude terminal volumes rose 16 to 108 bod while water gathering soared 34 to 87 bldThe company ended the quarter with leverage of 31xLooking ahead HESM forecast fullyear adjusted EBITDA of between 100103 billion up from a prior outlook of 990 million to 103 billion It is projecting DCF of between 820850 million versus a previous forecast of 815855 million It expects adjusted free cash flow of between 610640 million compared to prior guidance of 605645 million HESM also raised its guidance on throughput volumes for gas gathering and gas processingFor Q3 the company expects adjusted EBITDA to be between 250260 million It anticipates adjusted EBITDA growth to be higher in Q4HESM said it will continue to target at least 5 distribution growth through 2025 with a coverage ratio of at least 14x It projects at least 10 a year growth in net income and Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and 2025On its  COO John Gatling saidLast month HESM bought back 100 million units from HES and Global Infrastructure Partners GIP The company paid 3029 per unit Earlier in August GIP sold 10 million shares at a price of 2880 in a secondary offeringOverall HESM put up solid Q2 numbers One thing to note is that EBITDA growth did not keep pace with volume growth and price escalators largely because the company had high MVCs in 2022 that it was below at the time As such in Q2 what HESM largely saw was volumes mostly catching up to last years MVC levelsHESMs MVCs for this year were considerably lower in most categories outside of water gathering so its been important that the company see the surge in volumes in the 1H even though it hasnt led to big jumps in EBITDA or other metrics However now that volumes have caught up to 2022 MVC levels and with HES continuing its 4rig drilling program expect the HSEM to see nice growth after this yearTurning to valuation HESM stock trades at 93x the 2023 EBITDA consensus of 102 billion Based on the 2024 EBITDA consensus of 115 billion it is valued at 83xThe stock has a free cash flow yield of about 96 based on 2023 projections calling for 625 million in FCF And it pays out a dividend yield of 85 It expects to raise its dividend 5 annually at least through 2024The stock trades at a slight premium to some other midsized midstream operators that generally trade between 89x 2023 EBITDAGiven its contracts and ties to oil giant HES HESM continues to offer a nice mix of safety and growth HES is committed to increasing its Bakken production over the next couple of years and with oil prices where they are at there is no reason to think the oil major will deviate from its plansThe biggest risk to HESM would be for an oil price collapse that changes HES drilling plans but even then its contracts which see MVCs move up nicely next year would partially protect its EBITDA and cash flow Higher interest rates are a bit of a drag on cash flows while GIP and HES selling shares occasionally can be a bit of an overhangThat said HESM is one of the safest midstream stocks out there and it should see nice distribution growth over the next few years As such I continue to rate the stock a Buy My target is 33 which is an under 95x multiple on 2024 projected EBITDA Given its contracts and growth prospects I believe the stock deserves a slight premium to some of its peers   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or

157,"Southwestern Energy: Natural Gas Is Not Oil, Yet",Southwestern Energy  is a primarily natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in Houston Texas The company currently trades with a market cap of 7 BillionThe company was started all the way back in July 1929 just as theUnfortunately for Southwestern Energy horizontal drilling in gasshale unleashed an overabundance of gas and as the natural gas prices slowly decreased over the next decade heading into 2020 and 2021 the company sold its Fayetteville Shale position in 2018Today the company holds positions inSouthwestern Energy created this slide to share what they believe are the reasons they are on the right path as a company We will evaluate some of these points belowSouthwestern Energy has positioned itself as one of the premier natural gas producers making that their sole focus Their acreage is in the heart of the Haynesville Shale and the Appalachia Shales such as the Marcellus Shale Ive written about natural gas before and I believe demand for natural gas is poised to continue to growThe companys cash flow was on a difficult trajectory headed into 2020 After rearranging their balance sheet and receiving a decent increase in realized natural gas prices their cash flows appear to be more sustainableThe above table is from the Seeking Alpha financial data and the TTM data doesnt accurately represent the current situation Currently the company is once again outspending their operating cash flow and for both the previous three months as well as six months the company has had negative free cash flow I expect this will only be temporary but still old habits die hardThe bump in operating cash flows in 2022 came as natural gas prices skyrocketed However in the immediate next section you will see that thanks to their hedging program Southwestern Energy did not get to fully realize those pricesIt is important to understand that even though natural gas prices increase dramatically unless they stay there for a sustained period of time a company like Southwestern Energy will not get to realize those prices That is because the company has a hedging program which protects them on the downside but also limits their upside The company realized prices in June 2022 of 268 and had to forfeit 386 per Mcf thanks to their commodity derivatives contractsIn the most recent quarter they were able to reap the benefits of hedging by gaining just over 50 cents per Mcf However this still only brought the realized price per Mcf up to 202Considering that Southwestern Energy is once again outspending their cash flow it demonstrates that natural gas prices in this range are not attractively sustainable for Southwestern Energy Today Henry Hub natural gas prices have risen over the last month and are trading at 340 cents and so this should present a sustainable price for Southwestern Energy to make moneyAccording to the most recent 10Q The company currently has most of its production hedged through 2024 After 2024 the company will be able to realize substantially higher natural gas pricesassuming natural gas prices remain elevated I expect that they willIn 2020 the companys balance sheet was dangerously close to upside down when they took actions to improve it In order to do so the company when on an acquisition spree which was made feasible via share dilution See the next section where I show the increase in shares outstandingThe companys balance sheet is on a better path today Natural gas prices have rebounded from the pandemic and seem to be on a path where companies like Southwestern can make money Nevertheless hopefully the company has learned its lesson and proceeds to manage its balance sheet more responsibly going forwardThis slide below shows their debt maturity profile The company has a very manageable debt load until 2029 and 2030 If the company manages its finances well then the debt coming in 2029 and 2030 and beyond shouldnt be a problem in my humble estimationEach of the senior note issuances have a fixed interest rate that can be seen inside each bar in white fontThis demonstrates the risk of dilution if the company isnt able to make enough money to manage its balance sheet well The company had roughly 350 million shares outstanding in 2013 and so the company has a history of using share dilution to dig itself out of a holeHere I want to do a comparison I often mention that investing is a matter of choosing between various options And when we place our bets we should want to pick the fastest horse in the race In my  I wrote an article about Permian Resources  and as one would expect from its name Permian Resources is only focused in the Permian Basin The wells that are drilled in the Permian Basin are made up of a mix of oil and natural gas with most of them containing around 50 percent oil according to Permian ResourcesMany investors may not understand the difference between oil and natural gas and why it matters where you invest If you dont understand the difference then you will be prone to make a mistake Although these two are both hydrocarbons they are not the sameBoth can be measured by the amount of energy that is contained within their molecular structure Oil is a denser molecule than natural gas therefore as a general rule of thumb 6 mcf of natural gas equals the energy contained in one barrel of oil Six mcf is a much larger volume of hydrocarbons however it contains the same amount of energy contained within a barrel of oil Now monetarily speaking one Mcf of natural gas currently sells for roughly 340 cents while a barrel of oil sells for 86 per barrel One can easily see the differential between these two hydrocarbons Six mcf equals 340 x 6 2040 and so this presents the extreme price differential between 6 mcf of natural gas and 1 barrel of oil This makes companies that are leveraged to oil more attractive investmentsNow that Ive explained that lets look at some hard numbers from Permian Resources to see how they compare to Southwestern Energy I think the implications of the price differential between oil and natural gas will become more evident by comparing each companys financial performanceNotice how Permian Resources is ramping up its capital expenditure due to the fact that they continue to receive strong returns from their previous capex Therefore free cash flow isnt hurt by the increased CapExA strong balance sheet goes handinhand with profitable capital expenditures and the operating cash flow that resultPermian Resources has also diluted shares but much more mildly than Southwestern Energy And in fact they are about to dilute share much further with an allstock transaction to purchase Earthstone Energy  The difference in my opinion is that these shares dilutions are accretive to shareholders whereas Southwestern Energy is diluting shares to buy natural gas production which is not as accretive as PRs acquisition in my opinionI am rating Southwestern Energy a sell Im actually bullish on natural gas over the long term Over a long enough time horizon natural gas prices are going to rise as there is simply too large of a price differential between natural gas and oil The market has a way of slowly fixing these things That differential will be squeezed over time as natural gas markets continue to become more mature And although there are some who might find this prediction strange I believe Bitcoin will be a big driver of closing the gap between oil and natural gas I wrote about this possibility in an  Despite this fact I still cannot recommend buying Southwestern Energy Why is thatFirst the company doesnt have a proven track record of managing itself well in my opinion Granted they faced an uphill battle with depressed natural gas prices through 2020 In 202021 they made some acquisitions which put the company on a better path And they likely made some acquisitions at the very low point in the market which is a good But in order to do so they diluted shareholders while purchasing more natural gas focused production Given natural gas prices I cannot recommend that investors consider allocating capital thereSecond the management team is largely the same as it was then The CEO has been the CEO since 2016 when he graduated to the position from COOThird even if you believe natural gas prices will increase I do not believe it is prudent for investors to bet on natural gas prices increasing by investing in a purely natural gas company Most companies that are focused on oilshale are also receiving a substantial amount of natural gas from each well So if oil is providing the strongest returns at the moment why not invest there and when natural gas prices rise youll also reap the benefits of higher natural gas pricesNow I will say that the upside for natural gas is higher than oil For example its not out of the realm of possibilities for natural gas to 3x over the next 5 years If that does happen Southwestern Energy will likely outperform companies that are focused solely on oilshale This is the nature of being more leveraged to a more volatile asset such as natural gas But again as a financial minded investor who tries to consider the risks between companies and their strategies oilshale companies represent a better riskadjusted opportunity For that reason relative to oilfocused shale companies Southwestern Energy is a sell   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed

158,"No Longer How High For The Fed, But How Long","The major market averages logged a fourth consecutive day of gains on the tailcoats of lower longterm bond yields and the 2pm release of minutes from the Feds September meeting which offered a more balanced outlook While most policymakers suggested thatI believe the ratehike debate is over and the CME Fed funds futures market agrees as the probability of another increase this year hasA major concern for Fed officials cited in the meeting  was the sharp rise in energy costs which some worried could pose upside risks to inflation but crude oil  has plunged nearly 12 from its recent high of 95 which should alleviate worriesI did not see it as a reason for concern in the first place as gasoline prices were no higher during the Feds meeting than they had been a year earlier In fact the latest weekly data from AAA shows the nationwide average has fallen to 366 The decline allows consumers to redirect discretionary income to other goods and services which could not be timelier as the rate of economic growth slows under tighter financial conditionsA soft landing is a constant tugofwar between strongerthanexpected and softerthanexpected incoming economic data This means bulls and bears can both point to statistics that help build their respective cases for very different economic and market outlooks Yet in the softlanding scenario the economy avoids a contraction as the strongerthanexpected data wins out Critical to this outcome is a Fed that avoids suffocating the economy before price stability is achieved I think it has done so provided its next move is a policy easing during the first half of 2024The most encouraging sign for the economy today is the fact that Wall Street analysts are increasing their earnings forecasts for the companies they follow in the year ahead despite much tighter financial conditions This is not what we see on the cusp of an economic contraction or recession While the consensus sees a return to yearoveryear profit growth for the SP 500  in the fourth quarter I think we will achieve that in one just ended when we conclude the thirdquarter earnings season This is why the market has started to recover its losses from August and September during the first several days of OctoberLots of services offer investment ideas but few offer a comprehensive topdown investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense That is how compliments other services that focus on the bottomups security analysis of REITs CEFs ETFs dividendpaying stocks and other securitiesLawrence Fuller has been managing portfolios for individual investors for 30 years starting his career at Merrill Lynch in 1993 and working in the same capacity with several other Wall Street firms before realizing his longterm goal of complete independence when he founded Fuller Asset Management  Lawrence Fuller is the Principal of Fuller Asset Management FAM a state registered investment adviser Information presented is for educational purposes only intended for a broad audience The information does not intend to make an offer or solicitation for the sale of purchase of any specific securities investments or investment strategies Investments involve risk and are not guaranteed FAM has reasonable belief that this marketing does not include any false or material misleading statements or omissions of facts regarding services investment or client experience FAM has reasonable belief that the content as a whole will not cause an untrue or misleading implication regarding the advisers services investments or client experiences Past performance of specific investment advice should not be relied upon without knowledge of certain circumstances or market events nature and timing of investments and relevant constraints of the investment FAM has presented information in a fair and balanced manner FAM is not giving tax legal or accounting advice

159,Seadrill: Bet On Rigs Deficit And Rising Oil Prices,The oil and gas industry reached the bottom of its CAPEX cycle The  in the new oil rigs caused a rising shortage of rigs On the other hand the demand is rising and  forSeadrill  owns the youngest fleet in the industry and has an industryleading leverage profile The company has liquidity to expand its fleet and available rigs to cash in on the rising demand On top of that I expect the oil price to rise further and in the next 12 months to surpass 100 per barrel Such a price will accelerate the dynamics I have already described So Seadrill is a great bet on the oil drilling industry revival and the new bull market for crudeI give it a buy rating because of the solidSeadrill is one of the major drilling companies It was incorporated in 2005 by Norwegian shipping mogul Jonh Fredriksen During its existence it had a few bankruptcies following the extreme cyclicality of the industry The last reincarnation of Seadrill was born on 22 January 2022 Since then the company has built one of the best fleets considering rig type and age The picture below from the  illustrates its current fleetThe demand for deep water and ultra deepwater rigs is growing To develop deepwater reserves every oil company needs drillships They are expensive and timeconsuming to build Usually it takes more than three years to produce Some new builds such as Transcoeans ships  exceed a billiondollar price tag Seadrill has 10 of those in its fleet On top of that the average age of the vessels is 11 years The chart below illustrates Seadrills fleet age It is the youngest among its peersAs per the last  the replacement cost of the Seadrills fleet with new builds is a staggering 118 billion Apart from it takes time to produce the rigs The shipyards carry the scars from the last cycle of capital destruction and they will be cautious reinvesting in CAPEX and taking new orders That means the supply of new rigs will remain tight for longerThe quote below is from an  published on Upstream onlineThe fleets young age combined with robust balance sheets gives a decisive advantage to Seadrill The company is not pushed to renew the current fleet Instead they can focus on expansion and acquisitions Said that  the company Aquadrill in December 2022 The image below shows the acquisition parametersThe transaction was completed in April 2023 Seadrills fleet thus increased by four drillships and three semisubmersibles The expected net benefits of this acquisition total 70 million per year due to the optimization of administrative costs logistics and CAPEX In addition the acquisition of Aquadrill added 470 million of backlog Following the transaction the quality of Seadrills fleet has improved significantlySeadrill customers are spread globally but three regions carry the most weight Brazil is the lead one with 38  revenues followed by the US at 22 and Norway at 19  Respectively the highest percentage of Seadrill revenue originates from Petrobras  ConocoPhillips  and Equinor Being long LATAM I am delighted with the exposure to Petrobras The Brazilian shelf has the  oil and gas reserves and  thereSeadrill backlog is notably rising The main contributors are companies operating in Brazil Mexico and Angola Growing backlog is a positive indicator for future cashflows I expect with higher oil prices the backlog will increase significantlySeadrills business is highly cyclical We are currently at the bottom of the CAPEX cycle characterized by minimal cash flow and rising capital expenditure Among its peers Seadrill has the most debtlight balance sheet They have successfully built a fleet without taking on excessive debt in an industry with a debttoequity ratio of over 200 The following chart from the companys last presentation compares Seadrill to other significant players in this industrySeadrill along with Valaris  are the tangible leaders Liquidity and solvency are critical for oil and gas drilling because wrong forecasts are incredibly costly in a highly cyclical industry In the following table I present Seadrills balance sheet The data is from the companys Seadrill excels in all parameters Negative net debt is the exception not a rule for the drilling industry Another liquidity metric I like to use is cash per share Seadrill is second to Valaris VAL with 516 per share while the other majors like Transocean  and Helmerich  Payne  have significantly less 104 the former and 222 the letterThat cash is a great advantage because it could improve a companys standing in multiple ways Clever acquisitions and fleet expansion I would like to see They are longterm investments with higher ROI than debt repayments during structural inflation periods The company will benefit twofold from inflation It will increase the value of its assets and diminish the size of its debtsOn top of that the day rate is already climbing high and reaching 450000 per day for Ultra DeepWater Rig The last record ten years ago was 62000 per day Inflationadjusted that is closer to 850000 The secular inflation will push further the day rates and they might surpass the previous recordThe companys revenue started to grow due to increased rig demand The bottom chart presents a forecast of the companys future earnings They assume day rates and utilization are below and around current levelsEBITDA in Scenario A is 900 million corresponding to a free cash flow of 600 million This implies an attractive valuation on an EVEBITDA basis of 48The table below presents the companys efficiency metrics TTM I use The data comes from Seadrill companys profile in Seeking AlphaData source Seeking Alpha Seadrill company profileThe table above represents the metrics I rely on when analyzing almost any business I focus on the revenue and FCF because they rarely fall victim to accounting tricks On top of that they represent the owners earning path Said that all the metrics show notable improvement in Seadrills business Profit margins gradually rise from the void reflecting the companys bottom lineOne crucial metric for every assetheavy business is CAPEX vs DA It measures the investment rate in new Plant Property and Equipment PPE For Seadrill and the industry the CapexDA ratio has been below 100 for the last eight yearsSeadrill compared to its peers and past performance is average The chart below from the companys profile in Seeking Alpha collates profitability metricsLike all other drilling companies Seadrill is already profitable due to growing demand for oil rigs I expect that trend to continue and at some point to accelerate because of rising oil pricesAmong institutional investors interest in oil and gas drilling is gaining traction Over the past few years companies have restructured and cleaned up their balance sheets In the meantime we have a creeping oil deficit Deep value and specialized funds are already building positions Seadrill is among the names attracting the most interest In the list below I share the most notable shareholdersNordea Bank  one of the largest Scandinavian banks They own 285 of the companys sharesEksportfinansiering Norge   a Norwegian state enterprise investing in and financing Norwegian companies They hold 1106  of the companys sharesElliott Investment Management LP  the fund of legendary investor Paul Singer Elliott They have been investing in oil and gas drilling companies in recent months Seadrill is among them They own 884 of the stock and 226 of the funds portfolioInterest in the industry and specifically in Seadrill is rising Paul Elliotts fund is an example of smart money and has significant exposure to the industry Seadrill is his largest oil and gas investmentCEO is Simon Johnson He has a strong background in the industry In 25 years he has been through Noble Corporation Borr Drilling and Diamond Offshore He was appointed as CEO of Seadrill on 24 March 2022 The CFO is Grant Creed one of the senior executives with the longest tenure at the company He started with the company in 2013 and has progressed through multiple management positions Before Seadrill he worked in Deloittes MA department The Chair is Julie Robertson She is among the industry leaders with 40 years of experience In addition to serving as Seadrills board chair she is a member of the board of directors of EOG Resources and Superior Energy ServicesThe managers do not own shares in the company Seadrill is one of the rare exceptions I make for the following reasons among the major investors are funds with high investment selection criteria Seadrill has exceptional levels of liquidity and solvency the managers have great experience in the industrySeadrill is a cyclical and capitalintensive business with a focus on tangible assets These features make the use of cash flowbased valuation fallacious Net Asset Value is the least misleading approach when we value assetheavy businesses like Seadrills Apart from NAV I compare the company against its peers using EVSales and Pricebook ratiosI calculate Net Asset Value as followsI use the following values from  reportFor Seadrill I got the following resultsNet Asset Value  4 754000000Fully diluted shares  79000000Intrinsic value per share  6017Current market price  4793 25082023I use EVSales and PriceCash Flow The metrics in the denominator are difficult to distort compared to earnings per share Seadrill is expensive based on the latter ratio but relatively cheap on the formerOil and gas drilling is a precarious and complex business It is exposed to economic financial and political risks The highest risk for Seadrill is the economic risk In that case the main variables are the inflation and the crude price In a high inflation environment and falling oil prices the profit margins will be squeezed due to collapsing demand for oil rigs and rising operating costs It is possible but not highly plausible to have declining oil prices and rising inflation Regarding the financial risk Seadrills management does a great job maintaining the companys leverage at exceptionally low levels for the industry The welldiversified portfolio of customers by geography mitigates the political risk to its minimum I consider Seadrill to be among the safest companies compared to its peersI expect the oil prices to reach above 100 per barrel in the next 1218 months boosting oil rig demand even more The biggest winners will be the drilling companies Seadrill with its young fleet prudent management and safe risk profile is a great play to bet on those dynamics I give Seadrill a buy rating because of the solid macro tailwinds and considering the small margin of safety compared to NAV The current prices represent an opportunity to build a longterm position with a 1224 month horizon I do not expect the price to decline more than 20 and would use such a drop to add more   Past performance is no

160,DC Jury Decides GSE Shareholder Contracts Breached,As of August 14 2023 Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac  shareholders have a new legal victory to celebrate After a decade of uphill legal battles shareholders have finally notched a win but the potentialFannie and Freddie have been retaining earnings since  Fannie and Freddie have more net worth than ever before in history since their guarantee fees have roughly doubled during conservatorship There areI only recommend owning junior preferred shares because they have dilution protection in an administrative reform outcome and the strongest legal claims in a courtled outcomeThis either gets resolved via administrative action or court action This marks the first major FHFA loss in court where a jury unanimously decided that FHFA breached the implied covenant of good faith built into the contract rights of shareholdersOutside of administrative reform courts will resolve this This jury awarded damages of 611M to shareholders Judge Lamberth did not let plaintiffs present the expectancy reliance damage model which would have opened the door to damages closer to the outstanding par value of junior preferred 34B Nearly every available damage model is designed to pay out face value to preferred shareholders expectancy restitution reliance etc The damage model that went to trial is extremely controversial FHFA has 60 days from the verdict to file notice of appeal If I was Arnold and Porter I would be recommending to their client that if they wanted to proactively end the conservatorship now would be a good time to do so Should they pursue appeal and go the court route they risk facing a damage model that actually fits the breach of contract that a jury has decided they committedThis court ruling in my view only helps the case for administrative reform In an administrative solution since the companies are retaining earnings  receivership is off the table and junior preferred would be made whole in the process The companies would likely turn on junior preferred dividends to settle the pending litigation while they move forward with recapitalization and release Junior preferred would trade up to face valueFannie Mae made  in Q2 2023 The SPS liquidation preference was 185B and the net worth was 69B Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar declared Fannie Mae has been transformed on the Fannie Mae has more money than they ever have had in history and the government still has them in conservatorshipFreddie Mac made  in Q2 2023 The SPS liquidation preference was 111B and the net worth was 42BFreddie Mac has more money than they ever have had in history and the government still has them in conservatorshipThe lead attorney for the shareholders compares the 611M legal victory to the 32B that shareholders invested as reported by If FHFA allows this verdict to be appealed it risks losing an upsized reliance damage model of 32B when it is in a position to resolve this now for much less This puts FHFA is in a unique position to cap their litigation losses before they potentially balloon They have about 60 days to appeal or pursue other optionsAugust 10th FHFA  the 2023 DoddFrank Act Stress Test Results The stress test results result in Fannie and Freddie making a combined 99B even if equity prices fall by 45 and home prices decline 38 Under these conditions FHFA does forecast that if they are able to use their discretionary accounting authority to write down Fannie and Freddies assets like they did in 2008 the companies would lose 84B Even with the loss the companies on a combined basis since they have been able to retain earnings since 2019 would have a net worth of 889B in this worst case scenarioMy perspective is that guarantee fees doubled during conservatorship and it is much harder to drain a bathtub when you pour in water as fast as it drains out which is basically what happens to achieve these stress test results whereas in the past earnings were half what they were today and you could accumulate a few years of losses  now even if the economy falls apart Fannie and Freddie stay afloat on earnings aloneMeanwhile FHFA currently has a Capital Framework which says they are undercapitalized and holds them hostage in conservatorship but it looks like they are trying to do something about itFHFA put out an RFI and the intellectually honest submissions I was able to find one exception by the guy who signed the net worth sweep that a jury ruled to be a breach of contract all seem to call for a reworking of the ERCF which makes sense in the context of these stress test results I walk through a handful of these submissions below and the growing chorus for admin reform now supported by this legal rulingIn May 2023 FHFA put out a  for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac SingleFamily Mortgage Pricing Framework The basic purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry feedback on how it should match pricing up with the capital requirements imposed by the Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework  ERCF The industry has responded with comments and feedback The overwhelming response to the FHFA RFI has been to streamline the capital rule and step asideThe most notable shift in my opinion coming from this RFI is the more administrative reform positioning coming from Urban Institute Urban Institute has really evolved their perspective to be more supportive of a utility model and raising new thirdparty capital which is a positive shift in support of administrative reform Urban Institute forecasts a  for Fannie and Freddie to raise private capitalUrban Institute says that the ECRF needs to be revised lowerLower capital requirements and raise new thirdparty capital is the path forward according to Urban InstituteThe CHLA argues in its letter that the objective of the capital rule is for Fannie and Freddie to exit from conservatorshipThe CHLA seems to think that the Biden administration is unwilling to let Fannie and Freddie recap and release and exit from conservatorship Note that they may have submitted this letter before the legal ruling came outAfter the legal ruling came out Rob Zimmer  that this legal ruling cements the future of Fannie and Freddie being recapped and released despite not knowing the exact timing of whenRob Zimmer seems to have reviewed the bulk of the responses to RFI etc Robs comments align with CHLAs Scott Olsons from  tooCHLA is very supportive of administrative recap and release and believes it is an eventuality  just a matter of whenThe Mortgage Bankers Association  FHFA that the ERCF shouldnt be based on Basel III Fannie and Freddie are not banks They should have a simple capital requirement that is based on actual risk This reads like a nudge to lower the capital requirements Seems like there is consensus from most interested parties on this topicPrior CEO of MBA David H Stevens declares this court ruling a landmark win for GSE Shareholder interests and had this to say on

who signed the net worth sweep that the jury just ruled to be a breach of contract and was submitted the same day the jury ruled that his actions breached the shareholder contractsEd Demarco argues that the Basel III Proposal Conflicts with the FHFA ERCF Further he  recommends increasing guarantee fees to support the ERCF I couldnt find any other comment letter where someone else is arguing for increased fees like Ed Demarco of the Housing Policy Council appears to beLeave it to Ed Demarco to argue for additional increases to guarantee fees that completely ignore the recent stress test results and the doubling of guarantee fees during conservatorship His perspective seems to have fallen out of step with Urban InstituteIf you have not been closely following the developments it is worth noting that Judge Lamberth rejected all four damage models presented by the plaintiffs  namely expectancy restitution reliance and the lost share alternative  prior to the trial The plaintiffs are now seeking to appeal these decisions with the aim of obtaining a damage model that aligns more closely with their actual financial loss due to the net worth sweepDuring the trial Judge Lamberth allowed one specific damage model to proceed resulting in a relatively modest damages amount of 611 million However this outcome has stirred controversy due to the nature of breach of contract damages models which are designed to restore the injured party to their prebreach state In the context of junior preferred shares this would involve receiving a payout close to the face value While the plaintiffs achieved a favorable outcome in the trial the damages awarded were notably smaller than what one would anticipate in a breach of contract case where the typical outcome is closer to a payout that would be closer to the original value of the contract or par Ive heard estimates anywhere between 818 months for the duration of such an appealThe concept of Expectancy entails restoring the nonbreaching party to the state they would have been in had the breach not occurred This involves considering the repayment of the liquidation preference that would have been received and factoring in the principal amount along with prejudgment interest at a rate of 6 approximately equaling 150 of the principalRestitution on the other hand centers around ensuring that the breaching party returns any net benefits acquired through the contract This involves deducting any gains obtained by the nonbreaching party as a result of the contractThe principle of Reliance seeks to reinstate the plaintiff parties to the position they were in prior to entering into the contractThe reliance damages model were in my view incorrectly not addressed by this Jury because Lamberth prevented them from going to trial twice due to timing issues not because they were not a valid damages modelIn response to this ruling some have speculated that FHFA will appeal but FHFA said they will review and determine posttrial options according to In fact GSE Shareholder Tim Pagliara says not so fastI believe Tim Pagliara is referring to the reliance damages model that Lamberth prevented from going to trial twice which effectively equals par less cumulative dividendsGSE Shareholder Plaintiff Bryndon Fisher  to Tyler vs Hennepin as a means to try and get his case heard in the federal circuit arguing that his case was wrongly decided and this new Supreme Court ruling changes everythingI applaud Bryndon Fishers legal efforts Below is the overall most recent litigation calendar from the end of last monthYou will note that Oral arguments in Collins vs Yellen are early next monthFannie and Freddie shareholders could continue to lose all the lawsuits and the government could keep them in conservatorship despite eventually retaining enough earnings to be adequately capitalized The world could fall apart and become unrecognizable with more devastating economic consequences than outlined in the 2023 Stress Test and the companies could be placed into receivership where existing shareholders are zeroed out Common shares could be diluted out of any material upside in any equity restructuringI think the biggest risk is really one of time Ive been in this trade since 2014 I thought that this would get resolved by the original Lamberth ruling that went completely opposite to my interpretation of the law What is ironic is that the day before the 8 Jury members unanimously decided FHFA breached the contracts they requested to have the law provided to them so they could read it for themselves It is nice to see a panel of 8 Americans read the law and interpret it the same way I have in a world where no court seems to agree with prior FHFA director Mark Calabrias  of the lawThe current Biden administration has been silent on the issue for restructuring its equity position in Fannie and Freddie but I suspect that will not be the case during the rest of the Biden admin and I believe that this jury verdict opens up a path for moving forward with an administrative initiative to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship The overwhelming response to FHFAs RFI has been to set the ECRF to be more in line with current guarantee fees in a postconservatorship environment and to solicit input from US Treasury I found a family office note that summarizes the impact of this legal ruling nicelyI recommend junior preferred shares because in any equity restructuring that happens outside of receivership they are made whole in addition to having strong enough legal claims now that they have won breach of contract to have a path forward of seeing par under a reliance damages modelEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a

162,"Energy Transfer: Some Compelling Narratives, But Not A Compelling Buy",The stock of Energy Transfer LP  an operator of a vast and diversified pool of energy assets has a number of subplots working for and against it In this article well highlight two important subplots and then closeEnergy Transfers EBITDA comes from 8 different sources but the segment were most enthused by is the segment that focuses on the transportation of NGL Natural Gas Liquids and Refined Products Last year it was the second largest contributor to annual group EBITDA but this year as of H1 it has become the top contributor accounting for of ETs total EBITDAIn H1 this segment saw impressive EBITDA YoY growth ofSecondly the surge in the export of ethane propane and other NGLs from America should not be underestimated Domestic propane inventories may be at record highs but whats key to note is that close to of this gets exported This year weve seen a few producers resort to production cuts and that too has limited the supply of propane inventories in the international market besides being a byproduct of natural gas production propane is also sourced during crude oil refining As a result US propane exports have gone through the roof see image and could stay elevated all through this yearThe trend of ethane exports is another shining light and should reflect well on this divisions numbers Note that in H1 ethane exports out of the country averaged barrels a day translating to solid growth of 22 but as recently as September ethane exports were hitting levels of over barrels a day We dont believe this is just shortterm euphoria either the EIA believes the country could continue to export at this 500k rate through the end of FY24Readers would also be interested to know that ET management recently stated that they are in discussions to lock in close to of the aggregate ethane volumes that will come into the system over the next 34 yearsIts also rather well known that ET is relatively well insulated from the capricious nature of commodity prices as its contracts are predominantly longterm and feebased but whats also key is the dominance of takeorpay transportation contracts particularly in this segment Currently ET is benefitting from some very strong volumes but even if volumes were to slow for some reason which is not the base case these contracts demand that payments be made to ET regardless of whether a fixed volume is transportedTo flourish and build scale in this business management needs to exercise good judgment with capital and leverage and even though the jury is still out its fair to say that things are better than where they were a few years backAt the start of last year Energy Transfer had intended to only deploy 1575bn18bn by way of growth CAPEX but primarily on account of the Lotus Midstream acquisition this year further investments will also be made there pushing up the overall figure All in all growth CAPEX for the year will likely come in within a higher range of  and the longterm plan is for the company to push the CAPEX runrate closer to 3bn paWe understand that this likely rampup in CAPEX wont please all stakeholders of ET but we feel investors should be less skeptical in questioning the capital allocation and financing decisions of the management particularly in light of some of the improvements engendered in recent yearsFirstly we bring to attention the manner in which ET has been financing its growing asset base in recent years A couple of years back around 53 of the asset base was being financed by debt however this has consistently crept down since then and currently stands at around 45It also helps that ETs assets are now generating some useful FCF which in turn puts less pressure on the need for external funds something it was barely managing to do during the prepandemic eraAdmittedly ET still has a hefty sum of  of total debt on its balance sheet and some of you may be wondering how best placed the company looks in a higher interest rate environment but do note that as of H123 only 10 of its total debt consisted of floating rate debtNote that as a function of EBITDA ETs target debt level range is  and hitting the lower end of that range is something they intend to do very soon If that happens investors have another added reason to feel more encouraged as you could see the company recommence its unit buyback activities something which has gone dormant since For context note that the company still has around 880m of funds that could be authorized towards this endeavorEven though we can find plenty of reasons to appreciate the wellrounded business of Energy Transfer we are not necessarily convinced that this is the right time to kickstart a long position in the stock per se Heres whyLets first look at ETs longterm price imprints on the monthly chart Since dropping to the pandemic lows of sub 4 the stock has done well to make up lost ground by trending up in the shape of a rising wedge pattern However the issue with a rising wedge pattern is that it typically signs the increasing possibility of a after an uptrendNow an inverted Vshaped reversal in the price action may not necessarily come to fruition but we do think the possibility of sideways movement has increased rather than another strong move higherWe say this because firstly the share has not resorted to any major pullbacks since the start of 2022 rather theres just been a pause for a brief while followed by another upward leg Secondly also consider that the stock has now revisited the old congestion zone which coalesced from Q22016 until Q32019 During this period ET had just chopped around within this zone lacking direction dont be surprised to see the stock take another breather hereThen prima facie relative to most other alternatives a 9 yield is something to behold but this should also be contextualized relative to what unitholders have typically received Even though the recent distribution growth came in at an impressive rate of YoY the uptrend in the stock has been such that the current distribution yield falls short of the 4year average by aroundYou also want to be getting into a stock when forward valuations are well below the longterm average but with ET that is quite the opposite Currently the stock is priced at a forward EVEBITDA of 74x close to the peak of its 5year valuation range and 8 pricier than its 5year averageWe wouldnt be averse to paying this premium if the degree of EBITDA growth over the next few years was strong enough but data from YCharts show that EBITDA CAGR through FY25 will come in at an unremarkable pace of a little over 2Gauging insider sentiment towards a stock across different periods can also sometimes provide slight insight into what management thinks about the shares current valuation Well in that regard what we can see is that aggregate discretionary purchasing in Sep had come off in a big way from levels seen in August and in the current month there have been no purchases whatsoeverThe other thing to note is that even though ET primarily appeals to the retail cohort theres also ample participation from the institutional segment 40 the guys with deep pockets who often drive big moves in the stockIf one looks at the size of the candles all through this year one wont find too many largebodied candles implying the lack of institutional participation and thats further reiterated by the data which shows that they havent really participated in the rally this year and have not shown any inclination to add to their positions all through this year In fact on a YTD basis the net shares owned by institutions are down by over 15 Granted these guys dont always get things right but yet still when the institutional positioning is moving one way and the price is moving another way one should perhaps pause and think twiceFinally also consider that ET is unlikely to benefit from any rotational interest in the energy infrastructure MLP space Note that the relative strength ratio of ET as a function of AMLP is currently trading well above the midpoint of its 7year range and is also not too far from hitting levels from where the ratio has previously pivoted   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is

163,Phillips 66: Crack Spread Decline Lowers EPS Estimate By Over Two-Thirds (Rating Downgrade),Over the past year I have held a bullish view of refinery stocks specifically Phillips 66  Refineries have outperformed the energy sector due to the rise in the price of gasoline and other refined products comparedMy  the crack spread will be permanently elevated compared to pre2020 levels until gasoline is phased out of  vehicles potentially giving Phillips 66 over a decade of significant returns This longterm outlook is based onOf course potential profit margins on oil refining have declined dramatically since August Philips 66 and its peers have hardly declined in value Thus refinery stocks may be significantly overvalued on a shortterm basis To better determine that we must look more closely at the core causes of the crack spreads volatility and how it may impact Phillips 66 on a shortterm basisSince 2020 oil production and refinery capacity utilization volatility have led to immense crack spread changes The crack spread is often measured as the difference between a barrel of twothirds RBOB gasoline plus onethird Heating Oil minus one barrel of crude oil There are 42 gallons per barrel To simplify I will show both on a 11 basis however the spread between RBOB and oil is generally more critical for Phillips 66s profits than the heating oil spread See belowThe gasoline spread is back in its 10year average range falling by over 50 over the past three months Conversely the heating oil spread which as a distillate is more telling of diesel fuel is back at its high range Overall the 321 crack spread which measures both together is down by over onethird over  the initial 2022 spike Accordingly aside from hedging and other sources of income this data implies Phillip 66s EPS will soon be back near its 2021 levelsThere are multiple causes for the boom and bust in the crack spread For one refinery capacity utilization was generally low earlier this year but strengthened dramatically over the summer improving the gasoline supply The manufacturing PMI has slipped over the past two years indicating a slowdown and contraction in industrial activity Further refinery capacity utilization has also fallen pointing toward a potential decline in gasoline demand See belowNotably the US  miles traveled is still around 25 below the preCOVID peak similar to 2018 Vehicle usage has increased throughout 2023 but remains just below preCOVID levels while gasoline production and products supplied are generally at 2019 levels These data indicate a small glut may have developed in the gasoline market over the past two monthsThat said total stocks of both gasoline and distillate fuels remain below average today Total petroleum product exports are also very high though they have declined marginally over the past two months See belowWith fuel exports high and inventories low there remains the significant possibility that gasoline will fall back into a shortage The price of crude oil has also risen dramatically over the past two months due to  that market creating higher costs for Phillips 66 The shortterm outlook for the companys refining margins is bearish due to the low crack spread today However there have been no evident fundamental supply changes such as dramatically improved refining infrastructure investments or a sharp increase in inventories that would point toward a prolonged glut Most likely the current small surplus is caused by a decline in gasoline demand associated with the economic trendFrom a longerterm standpoint were also seeing a massive increase in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles Interestingly there is a relatively strong correlation between the sales of these types of cars and the price of gasoline As gasoline becomes more expensive more people buy these more efficient vehicles to save costs See belowStrong EV sales are also promoted by a marked 19  vehicle prices over the past year partly due to overproduction and growing competition Of course as more companies build EV infrastructure theyre becoming more competitive with conventional vehicles which are  expensive Additionally battery prices are falling due to the overproduction of  which may continue over the coming yearsAdmittedly the core reason for my bullish perspective on Phillips 66 has been that I do not believe EV adoption will be as quick as many investors expect I think barriers include higher prices technological constraints utility infrastructure needs and greater exposure to economic shifts due to higher prices That said the fundamental trend does not support my previous outlook as improved battery prices and immense infrastructure investments are making electric vehicles more competitive which has dramatically accelerated in 2023The recent sharp decline in EV prices has caused some analysts to expect that  be electric by 2030 Such an outlook appeared to be extreme in the past but given the increase in fuel prices and the decline in EV production costs it is becoming far more reasonable In my view the primary remaining barrier is  infrastructure and poor investment patterns by significant utilities Still if that barrier is overcome electric vehicles may be adopted accelerated potentially limiting gasoline demand significantly Roughly twothirds of crude oil is used for transportation  for some fuel products Given that Phillips 66 does far relatively significant longterm risk associated with a potentially complete decline in transportation gasoline demandAround onehalf to twothirds of Phillips  is derived from its refining segment Other vital segments include downstream marketing and midstream transportation which should be stable due to the current volatility in crack spreads The overall crack spread is now back at similar levels to its 2021 and 2019 range but above its 2020 range Between 2021 and 2019 Phillips 66 had an average  segment income of 282M Its refining income was over 5B annually during the first half of 2023 indicating immense exposure to changes in crack spreadsSince the company  crack spreads I will estimate its future income using the 282M average for 2019 and 2021 given the crack spread is now back in that range However I will extrapolate its income for its other segments based on their sixmonth profits during Q1 and Q2 of this year Total segment profits from nonrefining segments were 215B during the first half of 2023 giving us a 43B nonrefining annualized profit outlook Combined with expected losses on refining its annual profit outlook is 403B Those  each segments interest depreciation and other operating and nonoperating costs excluding taxes At a 25 tax rate my income target for PSX is 302B or 287B after accounting for noncontrolling interestsWith a twelvemonth profit outlook of 287B I expect PSX to deliver an EPS of around 645 This figure is well below the consensus EPS estimate from other analysts  However most of those estimates were likely made before the very recent crack spread crash erasing the most significant portion of Phillips 66s usual income Of course my method for estimating its segment income may differ from others so there is a wide range in potential variation to its income with  1B not being unreasonable Further based on low gasoline stocks the crack spread could certainly rebound over the coming months should the minor glut reverse That said I prefer to make estimates based on current commodity pricesPSX has traded at an unreasonable low PE over recent years due to immense profits in its refining segment Since the data has shifted against refining profits its EPS will likely decline  back to around 645 Before 2020 PSX traded at a PE of around 125X during most of the 2010s decade which were more stable years for crack spreads but not oil prices Using my EPS target at a 125X valuation I value PSX at 80 per share today just over 25 below its current share priceAs such I am slightly bearish on the stock today but would not bet against it because the crack spread could rebound and dramatically improve its outlook Obviously my new target for PSX is quite bearish compared to my bullish outlook seven months ago I continue to believe that PSX could have ample longterm upside due to a lack of total refining capacity as previously discussed However as investors we must also remember the immediate reality which is bearish for Phillips 66 due mainly to the sharp increase in oil prices and stagnate gas pricesFurther my longterm view is based on the rate of adoption of electric vehicles If adoption is slow then Phillips 66 could benefit from abnormally high crack spreads as it has over recent years However if adoption is faster as  to see this year then marginally lower gasoline demand could easily cause crack spreads to become lower than usual At this point I will not admit that EV demand is so high that the bulk of the refining business model will soon be antiquated However it is admittedly more elevated than I previously assumed mainly due to improvements in battery costs and greater EV price competition If that pattern continues through 2024 Phillips 66 could face more significant issues as gasoline demand falters Even then I believe the company should have enough time to alter its investments to cater to a postgasoline future which could be anywhere from one to three decades away   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular

164,Microsoft: Take Your Profits Before They Disappear (Rating Downgrade),Many investors get into trouble holding popular stocks well after a reasonable valuation disappears The old Wall Street adage is  Greed and arrogance can work during aRising interest rates as investment competition a slowing economy a valuation that doesnt make much sense vs realistic math and an overhyped  AI landscape in late 2023 make a serious case to liquidate on this weeks price strength The pressure to sell Microsoft has been growing day after day week after week since late summer If you remain long justFor example Microsoft declined 65 over 12 months between the end of 1999 and 2000 at the end of the Dotcom Tech boom Believe it or not today I find plenty of sentiment overly optimistic valuation amazingly extended and technical trading weak buying volume with fading price similarities to the beginning months of 2000Dont say such cannot happen again If we are at the cusp of a multiyear recession where Microsoft is headed toward snowballing disappointment from operations a 50 or greater decline is not impossible For prudent investors why not take some chips off the table Current projected growth rates from the business are above average but the valuation is already discounting years of good times ahead What if a recession blunts future business resultsLooking at the macroeconomic backdrop my view is this is good as it gets for longs I am downgrading my intermediateterm view from last Novembers to  For a 12month outlook I expect MSFT to trade flat to lower during 2024In some respects the overvaluation problem at Microsoft is not any worse than late 2021s peak I dont know if this is much consolation given price to trailing earnings 35x sales 12x cash flow 29x and book value 122x are each DOUBLE the levels of 10 years ago during the final months of 2013 For sure these stats are in the growthstock categoryWhen we include changing cash and debt levels over the years enterprise valuations are an even larger stretch vs a decade ago EV to basic cash EBITDA has steadily risen from 8x to 22x today EV to sales has climbed from less than 4x to 11x In other words if Wall Street put the same valuation multiples on company results as late 2013 the current stock quote would be at least 50 lower in the 150 to 175 rangeUnfortunately the interest rate jump since the end of 2021 is now highlighting an extraordinary disconnect between Microsofts earnings yield or free cash flow yield not pictured and shortterm investment yields available from riskfree Treasury Bills If I can capture a guaranteed return of money plus a guaranteed 5 return on my money why do I want to own a company delivering less in returns with NO guaranteesI have been explaining this conundrum for Big Tech investors since the middle of 2021 While the nominal earnings yield of 285 from Microsoft does not look much different than late 2015 a relative comparison to the 1year Treasury rate is wickedly bad at a negative 247 This adjusted number to riskfree cash investments is the worst since the 1990s tech boom peak into 2001 Remember this articles introductory chartMicrosoft didnt pay a dividend until 2003 Todays relative dividend yield stands at onehalf the equivalent rate of the SP 500 index essentially the worst setup since 2005 Given 40 of all longterm stock market gains in the SP 500 have come from dividend yield over the last 70 years 4 cash yield 6 price appreciation to create 10 annual returns the trailing rate of 08 is a complete failure And

sitting in a similar position to March 2000 Note prices are adjusted for 20 years in stock dividends paid starting in 2003If we dont experience a recession next year and interest rates come down considerably Microsoft could stay around current pricing or even be able to rise a little 10 to 20 for a total return under any bullish scenario in my view Yet bulls are counting on nothing breaking Assuming interest rates remain elevated and earningssales disappoint in 2024 considerable downside could become reality as todays ultrabullish optimism over Microsoft is proven too good to be trueI would use the betterthanexpected earnings report this week as an excellent opportunity to lockin some to all of your gains I firmly believe prices under 300 are coming soon as I place the odds of recession near 100 moving into 2024 The logic for a recession is piling up from the inverted Treasury yield curve for over a year to rare declines in total bank credit and the M2 money supply pulling down loan creation since summertime to an unexpected jump in crude oil and inflation on Middle East turmoil in OctoberCurrent analyst projections of sales and earnings growth rates in the 15 range

165,U.S. Oil & Gas Is A Good Bet - Jennifer Warren,Listen below or on the go via  or Energy expert  on why US oil and gas looks like a safe bet 130 recent industry MA sensible consolidation and correcting false narrative 1240  Hello Michael Hopkins with Seeking Alpha with Jennifer Warren from Concept ElementalYou just had a trip up to Montana and you presented a keynote about energy and geopolitics at the University of Montana and the World Affairs Council Maybe talk a little bit about that and what were some of the takeaways Yeah so this was a conference it was hosted by the Central and Southwest Asian Studies Center And that part of the world is connected to Russia China the Middle East Europe by definition So its in the middle of so many regions that are in the news so to speak of lateAnd so it was very timely to be there And there were absolutely foremost experts on the Middle East and the region And so that was really educational And I talked about energy and geopolitics largely from the point of view of having  all the shale booms and busts and what it means in terms of geopolitics And then it was also notable that at this time whats happening theres a lot of obviously geopolitical conflict right now which is really really ramping up marketsOne takeaway from my presentation was just that US oil and gas production is kind of looking like a bit of a safe harbor in some respects its a positive and I think that message came throughAnd also just the idea that physics is also driving this energy transition a lot a lot more than people would like to think but its kind of the truth And that was sort of also my other takeaway from the conferenceAnd just that energy production globally is really of net benefit to societies Its a source of economic development and its a positive story Its a good news story at a time when theres a lot of really tough challenges and hopefully these conflicts can end cause theres going to be economies to rebuild and energy is going to be at the core of this as well Thats kind of some of my high level takeaways from the conference So before that you attended an economics conference with leaders from around the globe and the Fed any highlights to share from that Yeah sure So yeah it was a pretty intense you know 7 days This conference it was the National Association of Business Economists And it was a gathering of economists from around the world and economists from all the major universities and Bloomberg was there and top economists Actually I sat next to one of the former top Chief Economists of the EIA which is our energy watchdog And there was somebody from the Embassy of AustraliaAnd yeah it was really pretty amazing And you know a few Fed presidents as well as one fed Board of Governors presentation that I found I was really struck by his presentation The message that he delivered was just that were doing all this were trying to smooth this economy out and theyre having to do it with interest rate increases that have had to happen for all kinds of reasons that we know and we wont go intoBut the whole idea is shared prosperity Again that same message that this is the endgame of it all you know and its a really complex task to get thereAnd you know its a tough job they have and I know theyre under constant criticism and scrutiny and analysis and I get it completely You know I used to do the same and I still watch quite a bit The other thing that was oh and kind of one of the takeaways was just that you know this continued restrictive policy stance but at the same time really trying to monitor current developmentsOf course theres backwards looking data and I know that there was kind of a criticism about their approach I read today by a leading thinker you know that theyre too backward looking they need to be more forward looking and all that But honestly you know from sitting there with them and listening to what theyre looking at too theyre about as forwardlooking as anyone could be you know I mean who has the crystal ball right So I mean so that was sort of my takeawayI would say I left that feeling confident you know confident in the leadership And then the other thing as I sat in on two panels one was on this you know supply chains and all this idea of reindustrialization things that you and I have been talking about we talked about it at the end of 2022 my after the Fed workAnd then we talked about it at the beginning the first quarter in videos and articles on supply chains and chips and all this change thats happening And its also of course driving a lot in tech as we know But with the supply chains one quick takeaway is just that there are these changing trading blocks happening that were starting to seeAnd we see this with investment even like Intel  investing in Germany and what is it Taiwan Manufacturing  you know the chip maker you know here in in Arizona you know just all of it is happening and its going to take timeAnd then the other thing is this is just one of my thoughts even though there are these sort of shifts in trading blocks were still trading with China not much less Its just happening through other proxiesSo its a still very interdependent globalized context And I think thats really apparent when you see even whats happening with the conflict going on in the Middle East No matter how you skin that cat were interconnected and our markets are interconnected and everyones invested in everyone else that sort of thing And there are all these legacy relationshipsAnd yeah theres some shifts and some new relationships And some of it were seeing in energy with our energy trade even with LNG and all that and so its just ts going to be something to continue to watch This is not going to move fast no matter what we hear announcements and things like thatIts just going to take  its all going to take time to see what shakes ultimately But I can say that the North American trading block is quite robust and its positive I even heard that from some economists comments and thats all its kind of obvious If you look at it through the energy lens its absolutely obviousAnd weve been talking about that You know Ive been talking about that since the last quarter of last year just this really national treasure that we haveBut now I want to talk about so this is just looking at oil futures And I was looking at this from a one month view October 5th to 7th you see oil prices go up like 4 They stay up they come down because were not sure whats happening they go back up And now as you can see theyre ratcheted theyve come up and everythings been kind of dragged down by whats happeningOil  have come down a little bit SP as well And some of thats driven by just the idea that you know all this conflict all this volatility all this uncertainty could start dinging global demand And that remains to be seen jurys outThis is just showing whats going on with oil supply which is also a big driver of and we cant see the tightness Hang on let me just try to do this a little bit smaller maybe in a different viewTightness is a big driver And now something I would say too is just that with this tightness between supply and demand that starts changing a little bit after the first because you know it takes a while for oil production to catch up right And prices are higher so there is some incentive to produce as well But its just sort of looking a bit tight for a little bit and then well see how that all shakes outAnd also geopolitics are going to have something to do with this One thing I would say is these other countries that are kind of involved in a lot of the geopolitical conflicts at the moment are also energy producers So I think theres that to also considerThis summer we have had the hottest most summer load demand ever And it was like 80 85 megawatts And remember Id been talking about the grid and the stress of the grid But I can also say with Texas you know its a grand experiment in energy trying to become energy efficientLike I said were well diversified with our energy mix We have a lot of renewables We have the transmission problems that everybody has And Ive discussed that in that kind of Texas million dollar mile story We have the connectivity issues that everybody hasSo what it all means is in spite of the IRA legislation its all still going to move slow But there are a lot of new ideas happening I actually listened to an energy conference on Friday and theres some really innovative things happening in Texas and thats a story for another dayAnd this is just speaking to the yield issue you know with the Fed and one thing I will say too I know theres been this focus about the term premium and what thats just really about is the addition to longterm yields that is not just attributed to interest rate risesAnd sort of what they were talking about at the economist conference was that  of the longterm yield one half of it right now is comprised of this term premium And that has to do with actors and behavior expectationsAnd something that is driving that it is thought is our national debt The idea that with interest rates being higher and then the national debt going up its going to get more expensive to fund that And thats a headwind that can crowd out investment it can do all sorts of things So if anything the idea of fiscal restraint is ever more importantAnd then this is something else from the Economist Conference  has a lot of debt that is not apparent and is not you know just discussed And that by 2025 this debt this hidden debt could be 5x as large as what is recognized by officially recognized counterparts So that is something and were in the same boatTheres been this movement towards oil and gas as an investment just because everything thats going on  which started last year is kind of a recipe for these hard assets Oil prices have been up its just kind of like a safe harbor in some respectsUS oil exports reached a high in the first half of 2023 And were just going to continue to export oil And thats a positive thing that were on the global stage with our oil and gas productionIn 2023 natural gas production per well theyve just become more efficient And that is partly why we see natural gas prices on the lower side just production is up because were producing roughly 13 million barrels a day of oil And with that as weve discussed comes a lot of associated gas in the Permian And theres a lot of oil production in the Theres gas production everywhere Haynesville and Appalachia and a lot of this is also going for LNG exports So its just showing though that the producers are getting more efficient with production compared to years past In the past youve written  about Pioneer  the Permian and now theres the Exxon   The general  what color do you have about thisWhat does this mean for the market for investors when theyre looking at these deals Yes so you know we talked about this consolidation happening you know potential happening in the industry at the end of last year You know in our  after the  we had  there are slides on this  we talked about you know the cash on the balance sheets of large oil and gas firms And that deals were getting bigger going to be and by default they are bigger So we kind of nailed that back thenAnd its playing out because also I think weve had to figure out where are oil prices going to be Whats the narrative You know is it this green transition or is it oil and gas what is happening in betweenReally right now with returns and with whats happening around the world this consolidation makes even more sense And then as oil prices are up again what are you going to do with that cash Are you just going to return it all to the shareholder or are you going to invest for tomorrowWell theyve decided to invest for tomorrow And the idea that you know okay some are saying oh this just means oil and gas is around a lot longer Well thats true And that was always true You know if you just look at the numbers the demand how much primary energy demand is met by fossil fuel usageAnd the affordability and all the things we have talked about in the past And of course absolutely you know this is also a way actually to produce these resources more cleanly when you have scale when you have efficiency you know so I dont think that speaks to it being done you know with less decarbonization in mind not at all Thats a false narrativeAnd so I would just say that the idea that Exxon and Chevron  are now making these major lets just call it 60 billion acquisitions respectively because thats what they are Pioneer was 60 and Hess is just a notch under 60 billionIt just speaks to the assets that make sense for those two players you know Exxon has a certain culture certain operations the Permian is a big deal for them This completes that part of their portfolio and their intentions their goal their stated goals that theyve had for a long time anyway So this kind of just fits right into thatAnd then with  because theyre a little bit different they have a little bit different strategic outlook And one thing thats been noted is the Guyana assets were a big deal for them And thats absolutely true And also theyre going to be in you know the basins there in the Rockies a little bit more with some of the assets they boughtSo I just think it speaks to these large  working with their competencies and so I think from an investment point of view is just a positive I have Exxon Pioneer I dont have much CVX I have it represented in other ways Id always wished I had CVX Dang it I was just doing other things but I do have some Hess  so thats goodSo I just think its the ideas what weve talked about even at the beginning of the year remember I was talking about scale efficiency consolidation all these things And it makes sense in this environment where inflation is higher Youve got to get those costs down And this is one way to do it So I think it makes a lot of senseAnd the other thing Ill note is just that you know weve talked about this US majors versus European majors point of view I think investors in the market are voting with their feet and with their pocketbooks And so that is my big big takeaway And geopolitics supports it Longterm economic growth and development supports it So do we see more deals coming down the pipeline then Probably I imagine its going to be happening all in the underbrushEverything that has happened in the last year on the geopolitical front which absolutely intersects with energy I think it really speaks to the environment that were in and the outlook ahead And that just the  its a good bet rightIts a positive development And it makes sense that theres consolidation because we are going to produce more efficiently in the future hydrocarbons we are going to produce them more cleanly And in fact in these tieups I think its going to actually bode well for innovation in the future as well So I think its a positive all around Exports I mean this is becoming like an important story it sounds like or its already an important story but does this become the story then for energy markets not only through the end of the year but maybe 2024 as well Yeah I think its a part of the story right Its not the whole story Its an important part of the story in looking at specific companiesYou know what are they able to export that has a decent growth trajectory ahead And we know energy is positive right Its needed but okay well will there be more shifts to energy trade routes I mean weve already had a huge shift once what happened with Russia invading Ukraine We know that Europe stopped using has been weaning off Russian pipeline gas theres still LNG floating around you know but we have been exporting a lot moreI think the projection is and I think we talked about this a couple of videos ago just that I think we were exporting like  in the summers like 13 BCF a day and its projected in the next number of years to go up to maybe 30 So thats growth thats consistent growth Its a projection Its a scenarioSame with natural gas liquids ethane propane you know all that Crude yes But theres a lot of different players in that space right And in different assets So theres a lot of nuance to the various firms as to who can do what you know not everybody can do it So thats one thingAnd so Id say be nuanced about it It is a theme you know but you better understand your numbers and how things are moving aroundLook at the production look at who different players like  and the Permian really great Permian player you know Whos solid whos got solid production thats got room to run in the future that kind of thing as wellI mean think about AI I mean oh you know when we had the  you know right before Memorial Day everyone was like huh AI every tech company involved is going to  from AI Woo lets watch the  go way up And it did but now its coming back down to earth like okay who can really leverage enterprise AI What aspect of AIEveryones hitched their wagon to the marketing idea of AI but certain firms can pull it off better than others You know its the same thinking same in energy same  Again I appreciate the time Very insightful Im looking forward to what happens next Thanks for having me MichaelEditors Note

166,"Defiance ETFs CEO: Israel-Hamas war will rise price in oil, affect inflation",Geopolitical tension in the Middle East could certainly play a role in possible higher oil prices and what the Federal Reserve would do to mitigate inflation in the US said Sylvia Jablonski CEO and cofounder of Defiance ETFsIn aIt will also depend on how different countries around the world plan to handle possible increases in oil prices Jablonski saidThe risk she said is that if we dont see more supply coming into the market to cater to this then that probably will be a number that impacts inflation she said So in that case we would have to see the other components of inflation coming down to come backEarlier this month crude oil prices rose considerably closer to 100 a barrel but they have seemed to cool down Oil prices however have increased by about 30 over the summer and the industry was divided on what its outlook would beThe unfolding war between Israel and Hamas could exploit those prices On Monday American and global oil futures  traded at around 4 higher at 86 a barrel following the news of the Hamas attack on Israel In addition any new US sanctions against Iran who is highly suspected to have helped Hamas conduct this attack or any potential risk to the shipping and infrastructure of the oil industry across the Middle East could jeopardize 500000 barrels per day of Iranian oil exports according to SP Global CBS News reported,0,2023-10-11,0
167,"Chevron Buys Low, Exxon Buys High",Major consolidation in the shale patch continued with Exxons  recent announcement to buy tier1 Permian producer Pioneer Resources  in a 60 billion  As shown in the graphic below Exxon was arguablyNote Red Annotations By The AuthorChevron closed the 63 billion allstock  on Aug 7 Including the assumption of debt the enterprise value of the transaction was 76 billion Using Chevron stockWhat Chevron got for its money also was impressiveWhile PDC Energy owned 25000 net acres and 28000 boed of production in the Permian Basin this deal was primarily a consolidation of the two companies DenverJulesburg acreage ie the DJ BasinThe graphic above was taken the Chevrons  and shows the extremely complimentary footprints of the two companies DJ Basin leaseholds As can be seen in the graphic PDC held 275000 net acres in the play and had 216000 boed of lowcarbon intensity production zero flaring in Q1 of which 60 was liquids On the  Chevrons CEO Mike Wirth saidIt also was noted on that conference call that PDC had a very frontend loaded capital program this year  meaning the PDC assets will be spinning off significant freecashflow for Chevron during the second half of the yearBottom line PDC Energy was an extremely attractive deal for Chevron shareholders and gives the company a diversified and strong runway for growth in the DJ Basin in addition to the companys tier1 position in the Permian BasinSince the PDC deal closed on Aug 7 almost two thirds of PDCs quarterly production will have been on Chevrons books for Q3 Per  current earnings estimates for Chevrons Q3 results are shown belowFor Q3 the average earnings estimate is for 356share That would be down considerably from the 556 Chevron earned in Q3 last year when oil and gas prices were significantly higher due to the impact of Russias war on Ukraine and the resulting breaking of the global energy supply chain However it would be an improvement from the 320share Chevron earned in  when the company generated 25 billion in free cash flowWith the addition of PDC production I suspect Chevron will announce Q3 production was well over 3 million boed As far as I know this will be the first time Chevron has quarterly production of over 3 million boedFor fullyear 2023 the above earnings estimate of 1389share obviously bodes well for shareholders in comparison with Chevrons current 604share dividend obligation That is I suspect shareholders will  at a minimum  receive at least the  that Chevron announced last January along with its 75 billion stock buyback planNote that Chevron has delivered superior dividend growth as compared to Exxon over the past five yearsThats likely due to Chevrons arguably superior management team and the fact that CVX has consistently held a much stronger balance sheet as compared to Exxon That balance sheet strength enabled Chevron to raise its dividend in 2020 and make a welltimed acquisition at pandemic lows while Exxon was borrowing money just to pay its existing dividend Over the past few years Chevron has also proved itself to be a much more efficient operator as compared to ExxonIn addition Chevron has been much more timely when it comes to making acquisitions Exxons illfated XTO debacle cost its shareholders dearly when the bottom fell out of natural gas prices and the XTO assets could not even cover the dividend obligation on the Exxon shares the company had issued to fund the XTO transaction That transaction was a primary reason that Exxons total returns for an entire decade were negative and led to institutional investors and money managers to support three Engine 1 nominees to Exxons Board of Directors see More recently note that Exxon paid a rich price for PioneerThe 25boe Exxon paid for Pioneers proven reserves is more than 3x what Chevron paid for PDC Energy and 5x what Chevron paid for the proven reserves of Noble Energy less than  In my opinion EOG Resources  would have been a much better choiceChevron remains my top pick among global supermajor oil and gas companies The company maintains a rocksolid balance sheet has excellent growth prospects in the Eastern Mediterranean Permian Basin DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico is generating very strong free cash flow and is shareholder friendly with excellent dividend growth and a massive share buyback programAccording to the EPS estimates shown above Chevron is expected to earn 1477share next year A 14x multiple equates to a stock price of 200plus 18 from the current 169 Add in Chevrons 36 yield and investors can expect a strong 20plus return over the next 12 months while also protecting their portfolios from inflation and geopolitical turmoilChevron is a buyIll end with a threeyear chart that shows Chevron stock consolidating a base around the 160 level I would argue the stock is on the cusp of a breakout that will easily and likely quite quickly  take the stock to 200share That is especially the case given the current geopolitical environment and the fact that combined Russia and Saudi Arabia are still holding millions of bbls of crude oil off the global market  I am an electronics engineer not a CFA

168,Energy Transfer: The Cash Flow Beast Everyone Should Own,  is a 41billion market cap firm that  across 41 US states and plays a vital role in transporting 30 of US natural gas 35 of US crude oil and 20 ofThe company is divided into 5 segments and has investments in subsidiaries involved in various energyrelated activities These include compression services natural gas marketing and resource management They also hold interests in other companies engaged in compression services and manage coal and natural resource properties generating revenue from royalties and land management activities NGL fractionation transportation and midstream gathered volumes hit record highs of 5 13 and 8 growth respectively Intrastate natural gas transportation rose by 3 while interstate gas transportation saw a substantial 17 increase Crude transportation and terminal volumes surged by 23 and 15 respectivelyThe increase in volumes helped slightly offset the sharp fall YoY in the price of transported commodities in all the companys main segments But of course this was not enough to achieve similar financial results to the previous yearDespite total revenues falling by 293 YoY in Q2 ETs adjusted EBITDA amounted to 312 billion compared to 323 billion in Q2 2022 which is not that bad Distributable cash flow DCF was 155 billion compared to 188 billion in Q2 2022 with excess cash flow after distributions at 579 millionAs of June 30 2023 their credit facility had 236 billion available  387 million in growth CAPEX for Q2 FY2023 ET acquired Lotus Midstream Operations and continues to integrate operations Lake Charles LNG secured nonbinding agreements for longterm LNG offtake totaling 36 million tonnes per annumThe companys liquidity is at a very good level and the constant attempts to expand the volume base speak in my opinion to the quality of the management of the excess cash flow Management is clearly looking to the years ahead and is not limited to the current conditions of the still ongoing bull oil  gas cycleLongterm debt on the balance sheet decreased by 74 compared to the previous year as part of the debt was transferred to shortterm debt which matures in 2024 The companys cash flow capacity seems sufficient in my opinion to service the debt easily the debt burden itself is not high in relation to equityET projected adjusted EBITDA for FY2023 to range between 131 billion and 134 billion Thats around 154 to the consensus revenue figure  from ET for FY2023A quarterly cash distribution of 031 per common unit 124 annualized was announced for Q2 2023 This puts the forward yield at 95 which is well above average even among energy stocks Many readers are probably wondering if this yield is sustainable as the OG sector is very cyclical and unstable to all sorts of macro issues Historically ETs payout grew at a CAGR of  10year period over the long term Today  that ETs dividend yield will increase to 1021 by FY2025Like many analysts at Seeking Alpha I  for the development of the global economy in the foreseeable future  this should certainly put pressure on demand for hydrocarbons of all types However in the case of ET this seems to be partially priced in as the yield is so high even though from a historical perspective we are now roughly in the zone of normalityBecause the falls of 2015 and 2020 in the chart above had very different reasons than the ones that are likely to happen next in my viewThis time the major oil exporters appear to be aware of the mediumterm risks and are positioning their production levels accordingly This has led to one of the most oil pricesupportive setups in crude oil inventories todayAt the same time demand for certain activities has not yet recovered from COVID such as the demand for jet fuel in ChinaIf we look at the positioning of hedge funds the energy sector does not seem to be that crowded so far despite its superior rise last monthIn my opinion the energy sector has not yet lost its attractiveness for investors as buying volumes have just started to return to the market according to data from Ned Davis proprietary source The valuation of the sector as a whole is also still enticing The energy sector accounts for 124 of the SP 500s gains third only to technology and financials However it accounts for only 43 of the indexs market capitalization placing it 8thET itself should get an additional tailwind from the growing buying power in the sector as the company looks like a very reliable midstream player with a good balance sheet healthy growth ambitions and now a very attractive dividend yield which sellside analysts believe is set to rise furtherAgain I suggest looking at a companys valuation in a historical context based on both TTM and FWD metrics I usually look at EVEBITDA in the case of oil and gas  EBITDAR Since YCharts does not provide data on EBITDAR values I will focus on the classic calculation formula for simplicity of visualizationSo lets take a look back at 2020 Crude oil futures fell into negative territory for the first time in their history forcing some derivatives textbooks authors to urgently add to their new editions Energy companies faced unprecedented downtime  no one needed oil The global economy was at a standstill and the prevailing uncertainty led to a general panic in the stock market As we can see in the chart below at the height of this panic the EVEBITDA of ET dropped to about 7x possibly even a bit lower After that the drop in actual EBITDA values from ET led to a sharp increase in this metric which is logicalSince 2021 oil and gas companies including ET have been on the upswing leading to a further decline in their EVEBITDA ratios As I wrote above this sector is very cyclical so it is not surprising that EVEBITDA multiples fall sharply at some point most likely they will rise sharply again when selling volumesprices fall if ETs volumes are growing at the moment we saw it in Q2 and the market is waiting for a probable increase in energy prices in the foreseeable future due to the building supply demand imbalance why is the FWD metric even lower than the TTM metric when the logic of things should be the other way around If you have an answer to my question please let me know in the comments belowI assume that even if the multiples of ET remain where they are now incomeseeking investors in the form of large funds and not only them should come to buy this stock because of its growth approach and shareholder return policy The distribution yield looks quite stable even against the backdrop of the sharp decline in the share price in recent monthsEven in the event of a mild recession ET should feel relatively comfortable thanks to its margin of safety How much further should its EVEBITDA ratio fallAnd what is the growth upside of ETs FCF yield in this caseI simply dont have answers to my last 2 questionsMy current Buy rating has a number of pitfalls First it is not at all necessary that hydrocarbon prices continue to rise as we have seen in recent weeks I believe that we still have a mild recession ahead of us due to declining purchasing power and rising real interest rates Oil prices are very elastic to changes in market demand So if the US manufacturing activity feels more pain than I expect the increase in volume from ET may not be enough to keep it undervaluedBe that as it may it seems to me that ET is now an excellent longterm choice for incomeseeking investors today while not all funds have yet managed to put their capital into this cash flow beastIf the influx of new investors I expect occurs the current valuation of ET will allow it to rise to 10 times EVEBITDA based on historical trends At a current enterprise value of 104 billion ET will become 15 undervalued in this case Amid its high dividend yield of over 9 ET looks even more attractiveTherefore ET stock is an undervalued Buy in my viewNow you can get access to the latest and

boost its growth rate by 15 and potentially could deliver 15 longterm returns Possibly for decades to comeLet me show you why TC Energy Corporation s spinoff makes one of the best 8 yielding stocks on earth even betterAnd you know whats most exciting of allTRPs dividend hasnt been this high since the tech bubble caused value stocks toAnd then this happenedFrom March 2000 to March 2009 the Nasdaq  fell 81 while TRP soared 470 This is a very shareholder friendly move for several reasons First the new TC energy will be focused on natural gas and renewables the fastest parts of its business First the new TC Energy is going to be focused on the fastestgrowing part of the business which management says can generate 7 longterm growthIn contrast the oil pipeline business has 2 to 3 growth created by inflation Its a regulated business where regulators permit annual inflation adjustmentsIn realterms this is a no growth business and now it wont be weighing on the potential valuation of TC energyTRPs debtEBITDA ratio hit 55 in 2022 causing Moodys to downgrade it to BBB equivalent and SP to put it on a negative outlookAfter this spinoff was announced Fitch affirmed its BBB stable ratingTRP is tapping into the new Spinco to pay down its own debt without putting the entire combined company at riskManagement isnt hurting anyone with this deal and by 2024 TRP says it can be back to target longterm leverage of 475XBy splitting the company TRP says that it will be able to make the new TRP grow 7 over time which is 1 faster than current guidance Which analysts agree with8 yield

171,Valaris: Uncovering Cash Flow Potential To Buy Back Shares,Investment Thesis Valaris Limited  is positioned for substantial growth and value appreciation in the offshore drilling industry The companys strategic advantages including a diverse fleet of highly valuable offshore drilling rigs and a favorable market landscape make itSupply Constraints The offshore drilling sector is witnessing rising demand from major oil companies and the supply of new drilling rigs is constrained after a severe and long downturn This scarcity of new tools is driving up leasing rates potentially boosting Valaris Limiteds earnings and cash flow The current industry order book is minimalHigh Entry Barriers Building new drillships is a capitalintensive and timeconsuming process with an estimated cost of at least 1 billion and several years for completion This substantial entry barrier limits competition and enhances Valaris Limiteds marketDeepwater Reserves Valaris Limited is well positioned to help the major oil companies to tap into the vast and promising deepwater oil reserves which are believed to be larger and more sustainable than onshore reserves This provides a longterm growth opportunity as offshore exploration and production activities continue to expandRestructured Balance Sheet Following its bankruptcy in 202021 Valaris Limited has successfully restructured its balance sheet and eliminated debt resulting in a stronger financial foundation The company now has a clean slate to focus on value creation and returning capital to shareholdersOwnership Transformation The ownership structure initially dominated by former bondholders is evolving which could lead to increased investor interest and liquidity in Valaris Limiteds stockTarget Price Valaris Limited is significantly undervalued at its current market price I have set a target price of 250 per share within the next 1224 months reflecting the companys growth in free cash flow from its highly valuable fleet and its commitment to buy back shares underwent several acquisitions including Pride International in 2011 Atwood Oceanics in 2017 and eventually Rowan Companies in 2019 This series of acquisitions led to the company changing its name to Valaris plc which is now known as Valaris Limited In 2020 the company experienced a bankruptcy process and successfully emerged from it in May 2021 Following the emergence its new stock began trading in the low 20s resulting in a market capitalization of 16 billion Through the bankruptcy proceedings the company managed to  and was left with 550 million in debt in the form of a second lien note maturing in 2028 along with 615 million in cash The company relocated its headquarters from London UK to Houston Texas as part of the restructuringValaris Limited currently owns 52 rigs including 11 drillships with options for 2 more 36 jackup rigs and 5 semisubmersible platform rigs These rigs are primarily contracted to major players in the oil industry over extended periods BP stands as the companys largest client contributing to 15 of its revenue in 2022 and Valaris Limited also maintains a significant joint venture partnership with Saudi AramcoCurrently there are 74 million shares outstanding along with 5645 million warrants set to expire on April 29 2028 with an exercise price of 13188 These warrants were initially issued to former common stockholders However due to the bankruptcy proceedings  with Oak Hill Advisors becoming the largest owner as of June 30 2023 Its worth noting that in August 2023  nearly half of its holdings reducing its ownership to 476 million shares equivalent to 65 of the total shares The largest shareholder is now Blackrock a passive indextracking investor with ownership of 6878 million shares accounting for 93 of the total Orbis Allan Gray Ltd whose founder Allan Gray passed away in 2019 holds 5076 million shares representing 69 of the sharesSeveral former bondholders still hold 13 million shares including Lodbrok Capital managed by Mikael Brantberg a former investment professional at Farallon Capital Och Ziff and Goldman Sachs Adage Capital led by Phil Gross another distressed bond investor also retains a position within this range Elliott Investment Management has been gradually reducing its stake but still maintains ownership within this range Notably there has been turnover in ownership with larger stakes being acquired by funds like Lingotto Investment Management and Coronation Fund Managers both of which have made recent substantial additions to their holdings consists mainly of new executives who bring with them extensive industry expertise Anton Dibowitz who took on the role of CEO in September 2021 came from Seadrill  a competitor in the industry bringing valuable experience with him Chris Weber who became the CFO in August 2022 also possesses industry knowledge gained from working in various roles at several oil and gas companies Gilles Luca the COO has been part of the company since 1997 and has served in various capacities over the yearsThe management team has made it clear in recent earnings calls and industry conference presentations that they are committed to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks They have already  and have more in store with a program worth 300 millionValaris Limited underwent a comprehensive balance sheet restructuring process through the courts and successfully emerged in May 2021 with a healthy balance sheet and all its assets intact Since then the company has experienced improvements in its earnings but the best is yet to come This optimism stems from the expectation that they will be able to charge higher day rates for their assets and as they replace older contracts with contracts at market rates there should be significant enhancements in earnings and cash flow the company reported revenues of 16 billion up from 155 billion in 2021 with operating income of 372 million a remarkable improvement from the previous years operating loss of 8974 million Furthermore the company achieved positive operating cash flow for the year amounting to 1275 million compared to a negative 66 million previously Although the pace of these improvements slowed in the first half of 2023 it was mainly due to the necessity of mobilizing assets from the less favorable Norwegian North Sea to more desirable locations Notably day rates have continued to rise revenue increased only by 05 and operating income remained negative at 10 million however the company sustained positive operating cash flow totaling 1226 million for the first half of 2023 compared to a negative 114 million in the first half of 2022 The expectation is that as the company secures contracts at market rates its earnings should experience substantial growth The first year where these improvements are expected to be fully realized is in 2025 The company recently posted a  which a few of the slides been used through this report See below for timing of contract expirationsThe companys recent presentation has shed light on the potential impact of these developments on earnings and free cash flow As day rates most likely continues higher the new contracts signed in 2024 could generate results surpassing the threshold represented by the C column in the graph belowIf the company adheres to the illustrative 15 billion free cash flow as emphasized by management in above slide the company has the theoretical capacity to repurchase approximately 2530 of the outstanding shares per year This calculation is based on the current shares outstanding which stand at 74 million shares and a share price of 70In essence the companys commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks combined with the anticipated improvements in earnings and free cash flow resulting from new contracts and higher day rates could have a substantial impact on its financial performance and shareholder value in the coming yearsThe company has already initiated a smaller buyback program originally planned for 150 million for the year but later extended to 200 million for 2023 As of now in 2023 they have already repurchased 94 million worth of shares This commitment to buybacks reflects the companys intention to return capital to its shareholders and not buy new drillships or jackupsAdditionally the company has an unconsolidated joint venture with Saudi Aramco called ARO Drilling in which both entities share a 5050 ownership ARO Drilling has been performing well with 16 rigs currently operating for Saudi Aramco and a substantial contract backlog of 15 billion as of the end of the second quarter of 2023 In 2022 ARO Drilling generated 422 million in revenue and had an EBITDA of 99 million This joint venture with its high utilization rate and stable cash flow is expected to contribute positively to the companys stock valueIn terms of the balance sheet the company maintains a strong financial position with 12 billion in cash and 108 billion in debt In August 2023 the company  at an interest rate of 8375 due in 2030 The proceeds from this issuance will be used to finance the  for the newbuild drillships VALARIS DS13 and VALARIS DS14 These drillships were acquired at a lower cost compared to current market prices with a total price of 337 million 119 million for DS13 and 218 million for DS14 Industry experts suggest that the clearing prices for similar drillships are likely to be 300 million or higherFurthermore the company has older drillships like  used to be called ENSCO DS10 and  used to be called Atwood Advantage which were built a decade ago and had significantly higher construction costs of 625 million and 600 million respectively VALARIS DS11 in particular was  for three years to Noble Energy starting in the fourth quarter of 2013 The acquisition of VALARIS DS14 along with VALARIS DS13 and the uncontracted stacked VALARIS DS11 presents potential upside to the companys earningsThe oil and gas industry is wellknown for its cyclical nature characterized by significant boom and bust cycles that also affect the rig and drilling segment The most recent boom occurred following the global financial crisis in 200809 and lasted until the summer of 2014 Subsequently there was a sharp downturn marking the start of the latest bust cycle peaking with a remarkable crash in crude oil futures pricing in April 2020This last downcycle had a severe and lasting impact on rigs with many of them being permanently decommissioned and a substantial number being placed in cold stack status However the industry is currently experiencing an upcycle primarily driven by an increase in oil prices and somewhat higher capital expenditure capex spending by major oil companiesIn the offshore rig and drillship segment there has been a notable resurgence Day rates have doubled from their lows in 202021 to their current levels standing at approximately 450000 for drillships and 150000 for jackup rigs This upturn reflects a more favorable environment for the industry with increased demand and pricing power for offshore drilling servicesIndeed the current dynamics in the offshore drilling industry present some unique challenges The absence of a substantial order book is a notable factor and the last drillships ordered and constructed are now being delivered at considerably lower prices compared to the cost of ordering and building new ones in the current market The cost for a new drillship has escalated to over 1 billion making it a substantial investmentSimilarly for stacked rigs the high utilization rates with the majority of rigs now active mean that there are fewer available for reactivation This situation can create constraints for companies seeking to expand or renew their drilling fleet as the supply of new builds is limited and reactivating stacked rigs may not be a feasible option due to their reduced availabilityThese market dynamics underscore the cyclical and capitalintensive nature of the offshore drilling industry where timing and cost considerations play a crucial role in the decisionmaking process for companies operating in this sectorThe CEOs statement in the Valaris Limiteds presentation at the Barclays conference highlights the considerable challenges and high barriers to entry in the offshore drilling industry To justify the investment in a new drillship day rates would need to substantially increase to around 900000 which is approximately double the current rates This requirement is based on the assumptions of high utilization rates 90 sustained over a 30year time horizon to achieve a reasonable return on the investmentThese assumptions underscore the fact that the conditions for launching a new build cycle in the industry appear quite distant Such a scenario would not only require significantly higher day rates but also a sustained demand for drilling services over an extended periodFurthermore  which is historically a key hub for shipbuilding in the industry poses an additional challenge Even if a company were willing to order a new drillship the constraints in shipyard capacity would make it extremely difficult to do soOverall these factors collectively contribute to the current complexities and uncertainties facing the offshore drilling sector emphasizing the cautious approach that companies must take when considering new investments in thisDemand in the offshore drilling industry has shown positive signs with major oil and gas companies actively exploring and investing in offshore drilling projects Several recent explorations and discoveries have occurred in offshore regions such as  and the  These discoveries highlight the ongoing interest and investment in offshore explorationThese offshore projects are characterized by their substantial scale and longterm nature requiring massive investments that extend over many years The exploration and development of offshore reserves often involves complex operations advanced technology and significant financial commitments However the potential rewards including access to vast reserves of hydrocarbons make these investments attractive to major players in the energy industryWhile onshore exploration may have slowed down in some areas the offshore sector continues to offer opportunities for growth and resource development As technology advances and companies pursue new discoveries it is likely that offshore drilling activity will continue to see improvements and expansion driven by the need to secure future energy resources and meet global energy demandsThe industry has experienced a prolonged and consistent decline During this period many ships and rigs were decommissioned and permanently removed and companies also merged For example Valaris Limited was formed through several mergers and now owns 51 drillships and jackups Some of the major companies in the industry include Transocean LTD  with 38 assets Shelf Drilling Ltd  with 36 assets Noble Corporation  with 32 assets Borr Drilling Ltd  with 24 assets Seadrill with 19 assets and Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc  with 12 assetsAccording to Rystad Energy Valaris Limited not only has the largest fleet but also boasts the highestranked fleet They have a stronger financial position compared to a company like Transocean which never underwent a restructuring and is burdened with over 7 billion in debt the same amount of debt that Valaris Limited managed to clear through the Chapter 11 processAs previously mentioned the company is poised to experience a significant increase in earnings by 2025 Free cash flow could potentially reach above 1 billion or perhaps even 15 billion This implies that the stock is currently trading at a multiple of 35x to 55x of free cash flow There is minimal risk of significantly increased capital expenditure capex and the proceeds from operations will be directed toward share buybacks Consequently by the end of 2025 the total number of shares outstanding could decrease to 60 million shares even if the stock is repurchased at a price of 100 per shareThe use of a doubledigit free cash flow multiple is reasonable because these assets can be productive for many years and a new build cycle seems unlikely in the next 510 years By applying a 10x multiple to the projected 2025 annual free cash flow of 15 billion the enterprise value is 15 billion With only 60 million shares in circulation this equates to a stock price of 250This calculation assumes that day rates will remain at their current levels which range from 450k to 500k However its important to consider a potential scenario where day rates approach the new build parity level of 900k In such a case the upside potential for Valaris Limiteds stock would be substantialAn alternative way to capitalize on this potential upside is by acquiring the warrants due in April 2028 with a strike price of 13188 If the stock reaches 250 by April 2026 these warrants would be 120 per share in the money and investors would still have two years until expiration Currently the warrants are trading at around 13 per share and could potentially provide a tenfold returnNow lets assess the worth of the companys assets in terms of replacement cost Most of the drillships were initially constructed for approximately 600 million However as mentioned a new generation drillship would now cost over 1 billion The two most recently delivered ships are estimated to be worth around 300 million each Using this rough valuation the 13 drillships alone would be worth 7 billion which equates to 95 per share Alternatively considering this hypothetical current build cost the value would be approximately 116 billion or 157 per shareIn addition the company owns 36 jackup rigs and 5 semisubmersible platform rigs Recent newbuild prices for jackups approached  as of 2020 If using a highly conservative comparable value of say 50 million per jackup these assets would add at least another 18 billion in value to the stock or 24 per share Doubling this estimate to 100 million per jackup would still represent a significant discount to the actual new build price and provide an addon value per share of 50Finally when considering the five semisubmersible platform rigs which cost between  each to build this represents an additional theoretical value of at least 2 billion or 27 per share When combined the estimated replacement cost of these assets ranges from 175 to 225 per share with a substantial discount applied to the jackup rigsThis comprehensive analysis underscores the potential undervaluation of Valaris Limiteds shares when compared to the upcoming free cash flow and the replacement cost of its assetsThe main overarching risk involves the potential decrease in oil demand combined with specific industry challenges like fewer offshore oil discoveries Theres also a political risk particularly in regions with unstable leadership and the overall trend towards higher taxes on offshore drilling due to climate change concerns This has been especially noticeable outside Norway leading to increased mobilization costs for Valaris Limited and higher opportunity costs Furthermore the risk of a major oil spill similar to the BP Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 could severely impact the industrys reputation and its daytoday operationsOn a companyspecific level there are various risks to considerRecontract Risk The uncertainty surrounding the renewal or extension of contracts for offshore drilling assets is a significant concern Changes in market conditions or industry dynamics could impact the ability to secure favorable terms for new contractsDamage to Rigs The risk of damage to drilling rigs whether due to accidents adverse weather conditions or other unforeseen events can lead to costly repairs downtime and potential disruptions in operationsCounterparty Risk When breaking longerterm contracts there is the inherent risk associated with counterparties not fulfilling their obligations This could result in financial losses and legal complications for the companyThese risks underscore the importance of robust risk management strategies and contingency planning within the offshore drilling industry Companies in this sector must carefully assess and mitigate these challenges to ensure their longterm sustainability and resilience in a dynamic and potentially volatile marketWe foresee a continuation of the positive trend in day rates for both drillships and jackups due to strong demand and a constrained supply As we approach 2024 the submarketpriced contracts are set to expire When the company secures contracts at prevailing market rates we anticipate a substantial increase in cash flow This enhanced cash flow position is expected to enable the company to implement a sizable share buyback program in 2025Furthermore we believe that these positive developments will prompt a reassessment or reevaluation of the companys stock price This perspective is rooted in the belief that improved financial performance specifically significant free cash flow and shareholderoriented initiatives such as share buybacks can positively influence the valuation of the companys stock and enhance investor

172,Unit Corporation: Small Company With Tons Of Cash And Big Dividends,I am recommending Unit Corporation  as a buy primarily due to its impressive 227 increase in operations income 150 increase in cash from operations and the elimination of all of its debt between DecemberThe vast majority of my figures come directly from UNTCs 2022  and UNTCs 2023 Q2  If the reader wishes to look into these documents further I have provided links for you to referenceFounded in 1963 Unit Corp began as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company and has since grown into a corporation that is now involved with oil and natural gas exploration and production as well as holding a 50 stake in a midstream pipeline company UNTCs operations are broken down into three basic business segments which consist ofThese 3 segments as of December 31st 2022 employed 653 people 512 of them working in the contract and drilling business 102 in the oil and natural gas business and 39 people employed under UNTCs general corporate groupUNTCs subsidiary Unit Drilling Company had an exciting amount of growth between 2021 and 2022 with a 94 increase in revenue from 761 million to 1477 million A convergence of an increase in day rate contracts year over year 39 on their BOSS rigs and 23 on their SCR rigs and a 50 increase in average number of drilling rigs in use being the primary causeThe oil and natural gas segment ran under the subsidiary Unit Petroleum saw a 20 increase in year over year revenue from 2722 million to 3262 million These Unit Petroleum revenue increases came from higher commodity prices Oil prices increased 15 to 5748 per barrel in 2022 and the average Henry Hub real natural gas price rose 53 and ranged from 985 MMBtu to 346 MMBtu from June of 2021 to June of 2022On March 1st 2022 Superior Pipeline LLC was deconsolidated from UNTCs revenue figures and therefore the revenue figures captured on UNTCs 2022 10K only reflect the first two months of the year leading to a 76 decrease in revenue from 3417 million to 832 million and a 74 decrease in operating costs year over year from 286 million to 738 millionOverall these substantial gains led to a 125 year over year operating income increase from 763 million to 172 million and a 196 increase in earnings from continuing operations from 482 million to 1425 million from 2021 to 2022UNTCs drilling revenues continued to see an exciting amount of growth in 2023 A 49 308 million increase in revenue brings Unit Drilling Company to 933 million in revenue for the first 6 months of 2023 from 625 million in revenue earned during the first six months of 2022 Average day rate increases of 50 on Unit Drillings BOSS rigs and a 34 average day rate increase on their SCR rigs are the primary drivers of UNTCs drilling business revenue growth while its contract drilling operating costs only increased a mere 3 during the same time periodUNTC subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company saw a large 58 decrease in revenues during the first six months of 2023 due to a trifecta of sinking natural gas natural gas liquids and oil prices from alltime highs in the first half of 2022 mixed with UNTCs large sell off of drilling properties in 2021 and 2022 which by default also led to lower production numbers UNTC has expressed a lot of interest in selling off large parts of its volatile gas and oil business and in 2021 sold off 234 million worth of gas and oil wells before doubling that number to 49 million worth in 2022 2022s well sell off accounted for 21 of Unit Petroleums total oil and natural gas properties That 21 of its properties Unit Petroleum sold off corresponds rather perfectly to the 21 reduction in natural gas production 23 decrease in oil production and 31 decrease in natural gas liquids production Unit Petroleum also experienced The remaining productive properties suffered from declining commodity prices The average price for a barrel of oil fell 27 the price of natural gas liquids fell 47 and natural gas prices tumbled 60 all while the cost of operations only decreased by 37 to 324 million from 516 million in the first six months of 2022All of these changes and sell offs to UNTCs businesses led to 782 million in income from operations during the first six months of 2023 compared to 1308 million in income from operations in the first six months of 2022 The major reason UNTCs income from operations contracted so sharply in the first six months of 2023 is because Superior Pipeline was still being listed under operations income until March of 2022 which provided UNTC with an additional 827 million in revenue during Q1 of 2022 as well as the company selling off interest in 727 wells in 2022 from its oil and natural gas businessAs mentioned above UNTC has been committed to selling off noncore or nonproductive assets within its various businesses and sold off 127 million worth of noncore contract drilling assets in 2021 and 128 million drilling assets in 2022 leading to a net gain of 101 million in 2021 and 84 million in 2022 In 2021 UNTC saw its oil and natural gas business Unit Petroleum sell off various gas and oil wells and related leases in several states with cash proceeds net of customary closing and postclosing adjustments amounting to 234 million In 2022 UNTC doubled the amount of gas and oil wells and related leases sold to 49 million worth Other noncore oil and natural gas assets sold off for 5 million in 2021 and 77 million in 2022 UNTC also saw interest income of 26 million in 2022 compared to 0 in 2021 because of its larger cash holdings from its larger income and asset sales Net income increased 145 from 606 million to 1484 million from 2021 to 2022In April of 2023 UNTC sold its 50 stake in Superior Pipeline for 20 million Unit received 12 million at the closing of the sale and is entitled to the other 8 million 12 months after the date of sale In May of 2023 UNTC closed on the sale of two of its SCR drilling rigs for 58 million as the company reduces its fleet to taper down to what it projects will be the future demand for oil and gas UNTC also sold off 95 million in other noncore assets in its drilling business in the first six months of 2023 and another 1 million in noncore assets from its oil and natural gas businessThe company did spend a lot of time narrowing down its business focus over the last three years By selling off 734 million worth of its wells from its oil and gas business 408 million worth of its drilling business assets in the past two and a half years and selling all of its stake in Superior Pipeline in 2023 UNTC is setting itself up for a more streamlined business model focused primarily on the less volatile contract drilling segment of its operationsUNTCs net cash from operating activities in 2022 was 1594 million compared to 176 million in net cash in 2021 This 166 million decrease 94 can be attributed to the absence of operating cash flows from Superior Pipeline after March 1st 2022 and from higher payments on derivative settlements 2021 was the first year showing a positive net income for UNTC since 2017 with a 606 million of net income in 2021 jumping all the way to 1484 million in 2022 while at the same time UNTCs debt shrank from 653 million in 2021 to just 48 million in 2022 A reduction in all of its debt should give UNTC a lot of freedom in future financial decisions as they wont be as sensitive to how future interest rate hikes will affect their interest and principle payments on their current debt loadThe first six months of 2023 saw Unit Corp earn 1627 million in net income vs 274 million in the first six months of 2022 and UNTC ended its second quarter with 1998 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents with a positive working capital balance of 2071 million Cash and cash equivalents jumped 728 from 2022s 1156 million and will be used to pay out two 250 dividends later this year one during the third quarter and one during fourth quarter of 2023The 250 dividend paid out on June 26th 2023 cost UNTC 241 million so two more 250 payments will likely use up somewhere between 48  50 million from UNTCs pile of cash Even after another hefty 2 dividend payments UNTC should still be sitting on close to 150 million in cash and cash equivalents and management should use this liquidity to offer up more dividend payments and stock buybacks Even after Q3 and Q4s dividend payments UNTC will still be holding onto a record amount of cash that is unprecedented when looking at the companys history It is also holding onto this much cash while getting rid of large sections of its business and it is on this basis that my argument for an increase in either buybacks or dividends rests primarily because a sell off of their business assets should correlate to less capital expenditure used in their remaining businessesIn 2022 the average number of drilling rigs Unit Drilling utilized went from 109 to 164 raising its oil rig utilization rate from 36 in 2021 to 78 in 2022 On top of more drilling rigs coming into operation UNTCs average revenue per day increased from 19097 to 24619UNTCs subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company had a 47 million decrease in proved oil and natural gas properties from 2021 to 2022 from 225 million to 177 million This decrease on property value comes from UNTCs announcement that it had expanded its 2021 divestiture program to include potentially the sale of all of its oil and natural gas properties and reserves While UNTC did end the relationship with the financial advisor it had hired to advise them through these sales in June of 2022 they did see the sell off of all of their Texas Gulf Coast oil and gas properties and related leases for 454 million as well as the sale of wells and related leases near the Oklahoma pan handle worth 36 million Thus far in 2023 Unit Petroleum has only made 1 million in proceeds from the sale of its noncore oil and natural gas assetsUnit Corp owned a 50 stake in Superior Pipeline LLC and acted as an operator to the company under its subsidiary company SPC Midstream Operating LLC where UNTC received 300000 a month to provide Superior Pipeline with operations and maintenance support accounting legal and human resource services Superiors value as of March 1st 2022 is listed under the equity section of UNTCs balance sheet which would explain their 1752 million increase in common equity from 1874 million to 3626 million from 2021 to 2022 In April of 2023 UNTC sold its 50 stake in Superior Pipeline for 20 millionAided largely by their drilling business segments massive increase in revenue from having more rigs active in the field and from the sales of their oil and natural gas properties and related leases UNTC saw a 234 increase in cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheet from 641 million in 2021 to 214 million 2022As of June 30th 2023 UNTC has had a 66 decrease in cash and cash equivalents to 1998 million however UNTC also has 79 million in notes receivable at the end of June 2023 compared to no notes receivable at the end of 2022 Bringing this into account UNTC should soon have 2077 million in cash on hand bringing the total realistic cash decrease down just 29 from the end of 2022 This change in cash isnt significantly surprising when taking into account how much in dividends UNTC has paid out so far in 2023 and in fact UNTC still has a significant amount of liquidity for future dividend payments and or stock buybacksCurrently UNTC has no debt and in the first six months of 2023 paid only 335000 in income taxes Operating costs for all business segments either decreased or remained practically unchanged when comparing the first six months of 2022 to the first six months of 2023 Superior Pipelines operating costs are completely nonexistent as UNTC has completely parted ways with the company selling off its 50 stake this past April Unit Petroleums oil and natural gas business due to its large well sell offs in 2022 has reduced its operating costs by 37 from 516 million in 2022 to 324 million in 2023 The only segment to increase its operating costs in the first six months of 2023 is Unit Drilling which saw a slight 3 rise of 18 million from 52 million to 538 millionWhen recommending stocks the biggest influence I take into account is a companies ability to weather adverse events concerning its general business climate UNTCs impressive ability to repay its debt and therefore reduce its interest payments on any debt it may have to refinance in the future gives an enormous advantage to UNTC in these next few years of interest rate uncertainty Its ability to clean up its balance sheet over the past few years is a key factor as to why I am recommending this stock as a buy but UNTC is still subject to some industry wide uncertainty that could hamper investors ability to realize gains from this undervalued stock Like all oil producers OPECs ability to set and support production levels for oil greatly impacts global oil demand and pricing Global oil and gas demand could also plummet if Chinas economic recovery continues to stagnate and plunges the rest of the world into a recession in which case UNTC could see a reduced demand for its drilling contracts and lower prices for its oil and natural gas business segments The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also throw curve balls at future global oil and natural gas prices that markets have not factored in yetAdverse climate effects in the United States can greatly influence demand for oil and natural gas as well Uncharacteristic weather patterns could increase demand but may also reduce UNTCs ability to deliver its products and services to its customers Large hurricane events can shut down off shore oil rigs and spike oil prices  can cause a surge in oil and natural gas demand uncharacteristic of normal seasonal forecasts and as we saw in 2022  for natural gas While derivates contracts limit future losses in the event that oil and natural gas prices fall derivates contracts also limit UNTCs ability to realize dramatic spikes in oil and gas prices as well and acts as a sort of insurance policy against extreme pricing volatilityIn January of 2023 UNTC announced and paid out a special cash dividend of 1000 a share returning a total of 961 million to shareholders On June 26th they returned another 241 million to shareholders through a 250 dividend payment and as of August 10th 2023 UNTC has approved two more 250 dividend payments one in the third and the other in the fourth quarter of 2023 the exact payment dates have yet to be announced This leaves UNTC with a current annual dividend yield of 1996 Should UNTC not follow through on future dividend payments or stock buybacks after posting 2024s 10K I would strongly consider selling this stock especially if its stock price performance remains flatIn June of 2021 UNTC began announcing it was buying back 25 million in outstanding common stock Over the course of the next year Unit made two more announcements one in October of 2021 increasing the buyback figure to 50 million and one in June of 2022 further increasing UNTCs funds for stock buybacks all the way up to 100 million This was accompanied by an impressive  in natural gas prices in 2021 and a  in natural gas prices in 2022 which helped propel UNTCs stock from under 10 in early 2021 a share to 64 in August of 2022UNTCs stock is currently experiencing a slump when compared to its 2022 performance The stock had hit an alltime high at 6575 in January 2023 shortly after the company announced its 10 special dividend payment and then slumped downwards hobbling around 4000 until May of 2023 before beginning to shoot up again after the announcement of a 250 dividend payment in June 2023 You can see UNTCs stock price jumping sharply though briefly the week of August 10th after UNTC announced that it had approved two more 250 dividend payments one in Q3 of 2023 and another in Q4 of 2023The price of natural gas tanked dramatically in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 Henry Hub natural gas prices were just over 9 per MMBtu in the middle of 2022 to 218 per MMBtu in June of 2023 Prices are expected to peak in 2023 at 344 per MMBtu in December and it does look like we have bottomed on natural gas prices as our supply chains readjust production and as the winter months of 2022 and 2023 had been abnormally warm reducing the need for natural gas consumption to heat homes At the same time that natural gas prices appear to be stabilizing the price of a barrel of crude oil is risingThis convergence of more stable natural gas prices higher oil prices and UNTC getting rid of a substantial portion of its oil and natural gas wells in 2022 before natural gas had bottomed so it can focus on the more stable segments of its business drilling should help UNTCs stock begin to trend upward again This seems all the more likely knowing that UNTC still has a large pile of cash in its war chest for further buybacks and dividend payments and may be further interested in selling off more of its natural gas assets now that the sale of Superior Pipeline has gone throughWhen compared to peers YPF Sociedad Anónima  OMV AG  Repsol SA ADR  Ecopetrol SA  and Imperial Oil Limited  on seeking alpha you can see UNTCs impressive earnings margins A 479 return on assets compared to their peers 59 to 167 range A return on total capital of 354 as compared with peers 41 to 165 range An EBIT margin of 4828 is also well above other comparable oil and gas peers with most others coming in between 69 and 341 Gross profit margins and net income are therefore predictably higher as well with gross profit margins of 54 vs 186 to 412 and a net income margin way above their peers of 703 versus a 39 to 154 rangeThe extreme case of net income outpacing the rest of UNTCs peers by so much can be attributed to their massive sell off of property as well as entire businesses but even so it is clear that UNTC has by selling off unproductive or noncore assets and by paying off all of their debt aligned themselves with a highly profitable low leveraged business model that has an open path to a more sustainably profitable future These earnings margins offer in some sense a margin of safety to UNTC for in the event of an economic downturn They have less of a chance of going belly up like many oil and gas companies did as a result of the 2014  2016 slump in oil prices The ability to weather adverse events as just described while their peers go out of business would lead to UNTC absorbing a higher percentage of business in the oil and gas industry clearing the way for future growthIf adverse business conditions become too great a risk for the company UNTC can just sell off the remainder of its businesses for a handsome profit With a market cap of 4735 million and current cash holdings of 1998 million at the end of June 2023 UNTC should be able to sell the rest of its business segments for more than theyre worth on paper PattersonUTI Energy  bought 17 oil rigs from Pioneer Energy Services Corp  in 2021 16 of which were super spec rigs similar to UNTCs BOSS rigs At the time day rates for the utilization of these oil rigs ran around 17000 and  Day rates currently sit at 31990 a day for UNTCs 14 Boss rigs and 22981 a day for their SCR rigs After subtracting UNTCs 1998 million worth of cash from their market cap you have 273 million in market cap value left to account for This is right in line with the value that would based off of the Pioneer Energy Services Corp transaction be paid out if UNTC sold off the rest of their drilling fleet This leaves UNTCs entire oil and gas business Unit Petroleum as pure profit for shareholders should UNTC liquidate itself and return its full value to shareholdersI believe for the reasons previously stated that UNTC is a buy Its earnings from operations and cash from operations have both shown an impressive increase this year while UNTC simultaneously continues to slim down its business model to focus on Unit Drilling its most stable business segment with the most predictable growth Its cash holding are currently near record highs even with an impressive amount of dividend payments in 2023 and some stock buybacks in 2022 which should translate to future dividend payments and buybacks as UNTC further slims down its business Oil prices and demand are currently surging and UNTC has good price leverage on their BOSS oil rigs which continue to consistently increase their day rates with ease Leaving the Superior Pipeline business and shrinking their exposure to the oil and natural gas business while focusing on drilling lessens their risk to the more volatile parts of the fossil fuel industry and enables them to focus on sustainable long term growthWhile the Dividend payments and stock buybacks have been nice I do think that there is more to come from UNTCs massive 1998 million pile of cash Buybacks could ensure the stock retains its relative value while the company narrows its business interests and even with two more 250 dividends due before 2024 I believe UNTC will likely present another large special lump sum dividend payment early next yearShould UNTC not follow through on future dividend payments or stock buybacks after posting 2024s 10K I would strongly consider selling this stock especially if its stock price performance remains flat If you dont necessarily like dealing with the volatility that comes with the fossil fuel industry a good time to consider selling UNTCs stock in the future is after a stock price spike that may occur after UNTC announces other large dividend payments While its stock should increase in price generally as natural gas prices improve and as oil prices continue to rise an excellent exit point may be created sometime early in 2024 as UNTC looks over their annual figures and historically makes large and exciting announcements to its shareholders UNTC has enough available cash on hand to issue another 1000 dividend payment and the stock shot up past 6500 after UNTC announced the previous 1000 dividend payment If UNTCs current stock price of 4990 shot up to 6500 shareholders buying in at todays price would realize a 303 gain on top of a current annual dividend

175,CEO John Hess Sells 90-Year Old Hess Corporation To Chevron,John Hess  CEO of Hess Corp   has  to sell his company to Chevron  for 171share in an allstock transaction worth an estimated 53 billion in Chevron CVX stock Including debt the transaction has a total enterprise valueAs I mentioned in the article referenced above here are recent valuation data points to consider based on the priceFrom this perspective Chevron is paying 60 billion for HESs yearend 2022 proven reserves of an estimated  That equates to  almost double what Exxon paid for PXDs proved reservesUnlike for the Noble and PDC Energy deals Chevron didnt offer any valuation metrics other than a slide showing a 2024 estimate for Hess would equate to an EVEBITDA ratio of 7x which is certainly reasonableYet considering I said Exxons deal for PXD was too expensive Chevrons purchase of HES must be  expensive right Wrong Heres whyFirst off the four deals listed in the bullets above were all for shalecentric companies HES is a much more diversified play Lets take a closer lookObviously Guyana is the crown jewel of the Hess portfolio As you know Guyana is a deepwater offshore convention oil field  an elephant field which was the largest discovery in the world over the last 10 yearsThe slide below from a recent  summarizes the multitude of discoveries 32 so far on Hess Stabroek BlockThe most recent recoverable oil estimate for Stabroek is 11 billion boe All things being equal but realizing they seldom are  Hess 30 stake in Stabroek means that its share of that estimate would be 33 billion boe But remember as mentioned earlier Hess 2022 yearend proved reserves estimate was only 126 billion boe Further and if the previous 32 major Stabroek discoveries so far are any indication the estimate for an incremental addition of 2 billion boe of added proved reserves for Hess could quite easily turn out to be pessimistic Indeed at this time another 12 exploratory wells are either being drilled or planned to be drilled in Guyana in the near future That is Guyana still represents a multibillion boe upside for Hess ie ChevronNote The five sanctioned projects so far all have breakeven points between 2535bbl BrentAnd remember Guyana is a conventional reservoir actually a group of reservoirs This means steady production for many years to come with  unlike shale  minimal incremental capex requirements once full production is reached Consider this The current 12 million boed production target for Stabroek and based on the most recent 11 billion boed estimate of recoverable reserves means that Its also important to realize that Hess already has made significant capex investments in the infrastructure required to bring Guyana into production Specifically for the FPSOs floating production storage and offloading vessels needed two are already online The company says theres a  and that could go as high as 10 FPSOs before all the discoveries are brought onlineThe latest Stabroek discovered recoverable resource estimates and production capacity ramp schedule are shown belowHess also owns a 465000 acre leasehold in the Bakken where its the operator with a 75 working interest In Q2 Hess produced  from the Bakken which was 29 yoy The Bakken is a free cash flow machine for Hess and is the primary one that enabled Hess to take on the large capex obligation for Guyana Indeed Hess production out of the Bakken in Q2 was still significantly greater than its share of Guyana production 110000 boedHess has an estimated 2100 drilling sites left in the Bakken and Im sure Chevron will plan  just as it did in the Permian  to wisely increase production to a plateau which it can sustain for many years to come Currently Hess is using a 4rig drilling program to continue growing Bakken production up to 200000 boedHess also owns excellent producing assets in the Gulf of Mexico  assets which Chevron is very familiar with I say that because the  field in the GoM is coowned by the two companies 57 Hess 43 Chevron with Hess as the operatorIn Q2 Hess produced 32000 boed in the GoM as compared to 29000 boed in Q2 of last year Meantime the recent Pickerel1 exploration well Hess 100 owner encountered 90 feet of net pay of high quality crude Planning is underway to tie back this well to the Tubular Bells production facility First oil is expected in mid2024 This will be another boost for Chevrons production profile in the GoM as post the deal it will be the operator and own 100 of Tubular Bells productionIn addition Hess generates stable longterm cash flow from highquality gas assets in Asia North Malay BayHess had implemented considerable put options in order to reduce the risk of its large capex obligation for Guyana In  this morning CEO Mike Wirth said Chevron will wind down the put options strategy  likely because Chevrons size diversity and strong balance sheet do not require any commodity price downside protection This is important because according to the pie chart shown below eliminating the put option strategy alone will save an estimated 200 million annually for the combined companiesDuring the QA part of the presentation some attractive tax considerations likely shown above under GA dark blue in the pie chart were discussed Apparently Hess domestic revenue was not large enough to enable it to take all the tax breaks it could have otherwise been taking but CVXs domestic revenue is large enough for the combined entities to do soMeantime along with the acquisition announcement Chevron squeezed in two goodies for existing Chevron shareholders and for future Hess shareholdersThese two announcements speak volumes at least to me about Chevrons confidence in the Hess acquisition Post the acquisition Chevron says it remains well positioned to fund both capex and to meet its dividend obligation with Brent at 50bbl At pixel time Brent is trading at  or nearly 40 above its breakeven pointDuring the Chevron presentations QA session this morning and if the questions were any indication the analysts consensus appeared to signal their belief that Hess sold out too low In an  earlier today Paul Sankey of Sankey Research said It is a little bit of a light price Sankey said he expected more than a 5 premium for Hess That does raise questions for the rest of the sector I think who dont have the asset base of HessHowever this is a great deal for Hess shareholders because if for no other reason their dividend will go from 175share to 604share this year and to an estimated 652share next yearSecondly as John Hess pointed out today Hess stock was up more than 90 last year the No 2 total return company in the entire SP 500 The point is Hess already has delivered excellent total returns for its shareholders and unleashed strong shareholder value Now with this transaction Hess shareholders will gain a huge increase in annual dividend income from Chevron to go along with the capital appreciation they got from HES shares over the past few yearsSo lets see 60 billion and a huge increase in the dividend Not bad Especially for a company that was started 90 years ago by John Hess father delivering fuel directly to consumers in an old truck Im quite certain Chevrons very attractive dividend  and its dividend growth potential  was a big factor in the Hess familys decision to sellAlso its important to point out that John Hess will become a member of the Chevron board Hess is very well respected in the industry and by governments across the world He will be an excellent addition to the Chevron board of directorsAt first blush it appeared that Chevron paid too much for Hess Yet after digging into the details of the Hess portfolio and the clear line of sight for significant highquality lowcost production growth many analysts thought CEO John Hess sold too lowBy my analysis the truth is in between because this is truly a winwin for both companies As a shareholder of both Exxon and Chevron Im much more pleased with this transaction as compared to Exxons purchase of Pioneer Resources which was just like XTO too expensive at least in my opinion In this case Chevron bought Hess just as the company was on the cusp of a big increase in production  and with excellent prospects for significant growth in proved reservesHES is a Hold Hess shareholders who want to sell prior to the acquisitions closer should look at the conversion rate  10250 shares of Chevron for each Hess share to guide their timingChevron remains my No 1 pick in the OG space Based on the attractive Hess acquisition the upcoming 8 increase in the dividend to an estimated 652annually or 4 the 25 billion increase in Chevrons annual share buyback plan to 20 billionyear and at pixel time the 564 haircut to Chevrons stock price today I reiterate my BUY recommendation on CVXIll end with a 10year total returns comparison of the three main companies mentioned in this articleAs you can see Hess beat both

176,Africa Oil: Doubling Down,Africa Oil  recently  from Eco Atlantic  of a material interest in some awarded blocks located in South Africa This gives Eco Atlantic some badly needed cash because Eco Atlantic hasThe company has additional growth opportunities through other companies owned as shown below that Africa Oil has a significant investment in the companies with which it has contracted at one time or another for either additional interests or to purchase more sharesThere are other companies within the Lundin Group of companies that haveAfrica Oil itself began as part of the Lundin Group of companies Several key officers have held other positions within this group of companies That close association is likely to continue well into the future This relationship gives the company access to a lot more resources than would be typical for a company of this sizeThis association also makes the transition to a new CEO far less risky than would be the case with a typical small company Most new senior officers come from elsewhere in the Lundin Group of companiesAfrica Oil further announced its intention to  the Kenya projects This further focuses the company on established production as well as the discovery in South Africa The withdrawal focuses the company on the projects with the best cash flow chances while eliminating some more speculative prospectsAfrica Oil is a relatively small player in some offshore projects that tend to be very large So far management has proven to be very adept at right sizing the risk This has allowed the company to grow considerably since it obtained a material income source Now it appears that the company will expand into South Africa in the future to diversify into another revenue sourceCash flow should grow at a material pace from the operator led program to drill more wells in Nigeria that provides all of the company cash flow should see considerable growth from the proposed campaign shown above Free cash flow will be either nonexistent or negative due to the investment required for this drilling plan However cash flow should climb as the program proceeds to enhance free cash flow significantly in the future for two water injection wells The third well a potential oil producer has now begun drilling alsoThe overall risk of this plan is considered less than is the case with pure exploration plays There is still a reduced risk of dry wells or unexpected complications But overall the chances of a successful production increase are pretty highThe operators of the producing properties in Nigeria are Chevron  and TotalEnergies  Operators of this stature add credence to the project in an area that is probably considered riskier than mostSince the production is offshore this production is insulated from the onshore issues of Nigeria and therefore reduces the perceived risk of operating in NigeriaThe government of Nigeria does support the industry But it is also considered somewhat ineffectiveManagement has noted several times that they have already received the purchase price of the interest back and more This is an important consideration when operating in an area with above average riskThe company itself is debt free Now the company it has an interest in which is called Prime  and also has just announced a refinancing of that debtHowever the cash position has deteriorated somewhat from the first quarter But it is still strong Management does have a conservative note that the company may need financing in the future depending upon how things go Management made the decision to advance some cash to Impact so that Impact has the money needed to fund some commitments But this came at the same time as the drilling campaign in Nigeria got underway Therefore cash flow is at best tight until that drilling campaign completesThe key is that this is a small company that is participating in some very large projects That often means some creativity until the company gets larger Fortunately this company has the resources of the Lundin Group of companies to help out if the need arisesThe risk of course would be that other partners to Prime fail and the company would have more than expected liability Right now that does not appear to be a consideration as Prime does generate a fair amount of cashThe company does have an interest in a discovery and it has interests in some nearby prospects through its ownership of Africa Energy The company has additional interests as well through its ownership of Eco Atlantic shares The managing operator of the discovery is Total The operator of the discovery has applied for an operating permit That process will likely take about a year Then it likely would take another several years before initial production is establishedTotal is also drilling some extension wells and will proceed to test themFortunately Africa Oil has established production from its Nigeria interests that can be used to finance the discovery in South Africa to production The debt free balance sheet would also allow for some debt as well should that be neededThe risk is of course large cash needs in South Africa combined with large cash needs in Nigeria While that currently appears to be unlikely to happen The chance is definitely not zeroSouth Africa is probably the country along with Namibia next door with the best infrastructure to support an oil industry on the African continent The government is stable and comparable to European governments An income source from this area would be more highly valued than the income from NigeriaAfrica Oil has transitioned from a development stage company to one with substantial production through its interest in Prime That interest will likely allow it to fully participate in the development of the South Africa discovery as well as potentially develop some other interests there should that prove to be a favorable way to goThe current income source in Nigeria has repaid the debt incurred to obtain that interest and more Now there is a good possibility of more income through a drilling campaign by one of the operators All this is important once the approval to bring the South African discovery to production happens The South Africa project would of course then need considerable cashThe extension of a lease in Nigeria has resulted in a reduction of future taxes owed That amount turned out to be relatively larger In fact it was far larger than any costs associated with the exit from KenyaSince Africa Oil does have a considerable income source the risk to shareholders of dilution in the future is not great Currently there are several projects that have demanded cash So far that need has been met with cash on hand There is a conservative warning in the financial statements that a possibility exists for the need for outside financing at some point in the future The company can also choose to maintain its interest in the invested companies Those companies have periodic financing needs as none of them have an income sourceNow the future is one of growth Clearly this company has above average risks due to the source of cash flow being in Nigeria However the debt free balance sheet and overall negative net debt when consolidating Prime appear to somewhat minimize that risk The diversification into South Africa brings a much more supportive atmosphere for a cash flow source That makes this company a strong buy consideration for those investors willing to accept the risksEditors Note This article discusses one or more

178,Exxon Mobil: Why This Dividend Zombie Deserves A Look,Its almost that time of the year One of everyones favorite holidays Halloween Where people get to dress up as their favorite characters and go out to have fun I remember as a kid being really excited toI assume many are familiar with the term dividend zombie But you dont hear about those too often Its usually dividend aristocrats  kings that are mentioned For those who dont know dividend zombies are those who have paid uninterrupted dividends for a century Theres a few companies that are aXOM traces its roots all the way back into the 1800s when the company was known as Standard Oil of New Jersey They were founded in 1882 but ordered to split by the Supreme Court in 1911 because of antitrust laws They traded as XON during the 70s until 1999 when they merged with Mobil to form the present name XOM A mix of dividend aristocrats kings  zombies should be a part of any longterm dividend investors portfolio And I know past performance doesnt necessarily predict future performance but a company that has been paying a dividend for 141 years is something to be recognized and praised today and missed on both the top and bottom line But despite the miss their share price rose Why was that Usually when companies miss especially on both the share price tumbles as investors are disappointed And to be fair the Q3 miss wasnt exactly a small one Revenue missed estimates by 181 billion coming in at 9076 billion But this was up nearly 95 from the prior quarter of 8291 billionThe revenue drop was attested to a 60 decrease in natural gas realizations and a 14 decrease in crude realizations Yearoveryear revenue fell more than 23 from 11207 billion But during Q3 2022 XOM achieved their bestever refining throughout North America and globally since the GFC in 2008NonGAAP EPS of 227 also missed analysts estimates by 009 but was up from 194 in the prior quarter Earnings fell by more than half from a year earlier where XOM reported earnings of 187 billion more than 105 higher than Q3s 91 billion reported So although 2022 was a spectacular year for the company 2023 has shaped up to be not so bad considering 2022 was a record year for XOM Below is a look at XOMs financials YTD As you can see cash from operations free cash flow  revenue were all down in Q2 As I previously mentioned this was due to decreases in natural gas and crude realizations Furthermore XOM had higher seasonal tax payments in Q2 as wellDespite a down year in comparison to 2022 XOM rewarded shareholders with another dividend increase raising the dividend by 44 from 091 to 095 cents a share YTD XOM has paid out 112 billion in dividends while repurchasing 12 billion worth of shares Additionally the company raised the dividend every year since 2001 with the exception of the pandemic year 2020XOM still held it steady while peers BP   Equinor ASA  were forced to cut theirs during COVID I like that management seems shareholder friendly returning cash to its shareholders every year And this has been more apparent in the last two years as they have bought a significant amount of shares than they have in the past decade Since 2021 XOM has taken roughly 55 of its shares off the market compared to the 2 in the years priorIn Q1 XOM managed to decrease their Net debt to Capital ratio to 4 further strengthening their balance sheet Theyve also managed to increase their cash  cash equivalents by 34 billion this year At the end of 2022 this balance stood at 296 billion Theyve also managed to decreased their debt by roughly 4 billion from 405 billion to 365 billion at the end of Q3 So XOM has been returning cash to shareholders via buybacks increased the dividend by 44 and managed to decrease their debt while growing their cash You cant ask for much more from a company especially considering the current macro environmentAnd management expects this to continue throughout the next several years As previously mentioned the company has delivered more than 72 billion in cost savings in Q1 and expects this to be 9 billion for the year One way they plan to do this is through reorganization continuing what have been doing over the years And they plan to capture a lot of efficiencies across the enterpriseTheyre also planning to reduce emissions XOM is on track to close on the Denbury acquisition next month With building this new business low carbon solutions XOM positions themselves as a leader in the energy transitions as seen by the Denbury acquisition announced this summer Denburys advantaged CO2 structure is expected to provide Exxon with significant opportunities to expand and accelerate their lowcarbon leadership across the Gulf Coast value chainsSince September XOM is down by doubledigits offering a great buying opportunity and a margin of safety Additionally they offer 21 upside to its price target of 128 Although the current dividend yield sits below its 5year average of 521 indicating it may be overvalued investors with a longterm outlook are getting a great starting to price to dollarcost average in my opinion As the recession approaches shares may continue to show weakness and investors should take advantage of the dipFurthermore their PE of 85x is lower than the sector median and the peer average of 97x Since October 2020 the price has appreciated from a low of 33 to 105 where it trades currently But as the stock continues to make acquisitions and buyback its shares I expect them to continue trending higherAs far as risks XOMs biggest risk is the decline of petroleum and natural gas prices in the future With climate change several countries are pushing towards a greener environment as seen by the rise in electric vehicles This decline in natural gas prices could impact XOMs financials leading to lower earnings and cash flows in the future But Exxon is well aware of this attempting to strengthen its business with the recent acquisition of Pioneer This is expected to pay off in the longterm and caused the stock to receive an  at Truist The acquisition is expected to deliver doubledigit returns by recovering resources  lowering emissions more efficiently Exxons peer Chevron  also recently acquired Hess Corporation  in an allstock transaction valued at 53 billion This was to gain a bigger oil footprint in the US and a stake in XOMs Guyana acquisition which is expected to close in NovemberAlthough Exxon missed on the top  bottom line the company still managed to raise the dividend Exxon was coming off a recent record 2022 so the numbers they have shown in 2023 are impressive considering the current macro environment Additionally they have been returning cash to shareholders in recent years and strengthening their business with recent acquisitions XOM plans to lead the transition in energy and lowcarbon emissions Furthermore they have been paying a dividend for 141 years has been increasing their cash balance while maintaining a fortress balance sheet For those reasons I rate the stock a buy   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given

180,Vale: Buy On Higher For Longer Iron Ore Prices,Vale  has been range bound for the better part of 3 years driven by investor skepticism surrounding the future of China steel demand and the residential construction crises despite consistently high IO iron ore prices IVale is one of the largest seaborne IO miners with the bulk of sales going to China As such the price setters are Chinese steel companies and their demand for IO has been thought to be greatly dependentThere are 4 reasons to forecast higher for longer IO pricesThis means that the seaborn IO miners have entered maturity with a few resounding caveats there main client depends on them there are scant substitutes for exported iron ore and the Chinese steel sector can take share from other steel makers via pricing In essence the iron ore miners are in symbiotic existence with the Chinese steel sectorThus the key to Vale fundamentals is the health and peculiarity of the Chinese steel sector As with the case for many Chinese companies the creation of shareholder value may not be a priority Employ and produce is more relevant As long as the steel companies can run production at near breakeven with plenty of govt subsidies they will make steel products for China and export the rest The exports prices can and have been highly competitive perhaps predatory or dumping but thats the operating modelVale and the Australian IO miners see peak China steel production in sight and should limit capacity expansion or perhaps begin to reduce This is similar to what many oil companies are doing rationalizing capex attempting to balance supply with demand and maintaining reasonable prices that permit very healthy FCF and dividend payouts ie capital disciplineChina is 50 of global steel capacity 1bn tons and it consumes most of the seaborn IO about 85 Thus as real estate construction demand fell and continues to decline massive over building China steel companies will export and displace share in any market without high import barriersBelow are my estimates of the seaborne IO balance between supply and demand There are many drivers and moving parts Fundamental to seaborne IO demand is that Chinese steel output remains near peak or near capacity while its primary suppliers do not add significant capacity Note that I assume global steel demand grows at half a percent in 2024 and 1 in 2025 any move higher means greater IO imbalanceThe Chinese Steel sector is large and divers I found data and consensus estimates for 9 companies One of the largest is Baoshan with 50m ton capacity 5 of totalContrary to headlines the sample group seems to be weathering the real estate construction sector decline well Revenue and EBITDA has fallen up to 1Q23 and now turned positive in 2Q23 Steel prices seem to have stabilized at above US500mt with the ratio to iron ore prices at 5x 4x is thought to be healthy Balance sheets seem to be in good shape with leverage under controlThe market as judged by consensus estimates seems to have a favorable outlook for the sector with over 20 upside and a significant EBITDA rebound in YE24 The demand side dynamics for iron ore looks robust or at least better than in YE22 and YE23Vale compares well on fundamentals vs its peer group of IO miners such as BHP  and Rio Tinto  We see similar growth and margin profile but at a lower valuation due primarily to lower business risk on product diversification and country risk ie Australia vs BrazilThe stock is cheap vs peers and relative to FCF generation and dividend payout trading at 37x EVEBITDA and 62x PE on YE24 consensus estimates The US165 price target is based on a 42x EVEBITDA target multiple below peers such as Rio Tinto and BHP which have a slightly lower risk profile as Australian companiesVale is a BUY on positive IO price dynamics supported by Chinese steel exports which drives significant free cash flow and dividendsshare buy backs The stocks valuation is discounted vs peers which further supports a possible rerate and 25 upside potential   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,18,2023-10-13,0
181,"PDI: Complete Devastation, Massive Income",  is a closedend mutual fund or CEF that seeks to provide investors with a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation The fund is actively managed by portfolio managers Joshua AndersonThe fund has some interesting holdings in its top 10 and that has led to some uncertainty but after the most recent decline in shares down to 1567 you can now buy and  Assuming the dividend is paidMake no mistake income stocks have been crushed but this is a name we were waiting for 16 and now we are below that level For the longterm investor now is the time to buy in our opinionLets be honest That PDI chart is disgusting If it was not for management and the shifting of holdings for income we would likely be short If this chart was one of a stock we would be pretty bearish However the payout is simply so good even if it were to be cut PDI is just an income machine While countless other investors have lost money on paper we are picking up their slackWe now are wanting to come into the fund Enough is enough here While you can earn 5 in a bond or money market with no risk but taking on some risk you can collect over 3 times that with PDI We like PDI as it invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including government and corporate bonds mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities and other debt instruments The fund also has the flexibility to invest across various fixed income sectors which allows the aforementioned fund managers to seek opportunities in different parts of the bond marketNow the price of PDI has dropped in recent weeks with a surge in rates To us this is opportunity despite expected shortterm pressure It is down due to fear over the leverage as management uses leverage to enhance potential returns This means that the fund borrows money to invest in additional securities and the borrowing rates are only getting more expensive The fear is further that it will hurt income PDI is over 40 levered on its net asset value benchmarks and is mostly doing so through reverse repos That said we like the port and the ability to shift itAs of the end of the last reporting period PDIs portfolio was allocated to 70 US investments 5 in the UK and the remaining in emerging markets while 25 of the securities are invested in nonagency backed mortgages instruments While the company does have nearly 1900 holdings here is the look at the top 10 as of 2 week agoSo the holdings are many and diverse but you get an idea of the major holdings above Generally speaking the company is invested in debt obligations and other incomeproducing securities We did mention the mortgagebacked securities but they also invest heavily in investment grade and highyield corporate dent as well as in both developed and emerging markets corporate and sovereign bonds As of the end of the last reporting period the company had 47 billion in assetsSo why is PDI fund getting crushed It is all about the surge in rates folks You see it is not just the socalled competition from bonds savings accounts money markets There is certainly some fixed income competition happening but the surge in rates has crushed a ton of income names While some may have been telling you to buy for many months we had been hesitant saving you capital depreciation pain even if it is on paper Now we see the fund as a buy as the income is just too goodBut the current economic environment is certainly a headwind for PDIs underlying assets This is because PDI has an average portfolio maturity ranging from zero to eight years With the rapid surge in rates and of course the decline in the principal the pressure is on the holdings and as such the value of the fund At this point however we have very little concern over the bountiful payout The investments made by the fund pay big time which is why you get a bountiful monthly dividend and special dividends over time Hold your nose and buy this for incomeWhy Despite the carnage PDI has a long history of providing its investors with very high level of income Folks this is not going to change and with the sale happening you need to take advantage Scale into the fund in 050 increments from here The investment will pay off Readers keep in mind that the fund has paid a monthly dividend for over 20 years now and as we mentioned it has also paid special dividends The 164 payout is simply a very attractive yield over 3 times that of most fixed income options Of course there is riskBut folks do your due diligence This is a quick pick for income and one that we have looked at more in depth at our investing group but the fact is that PDI is a very complex fund It really is important to understand the risks involved before investing First there is PDIs use of leverage which can and does amplify gains but can also magnify nearterm losses PDI is very sensitive to changes in interest rates and other market conditions than a nonleveraged fund and given the spike in rates you have seen the value of the fund plummet to these buyable levels in the 15 range Further this is a closedend fund and given the supply and demand for buying the shares may trade at a premium or discount to the funds net asset value Right now it is on sale There is also credit risk because PDI invests in a variety of fixed income securities including some that are issued by lowercredit quality borrowers so there is risk of defaultWith that said we think that PDI is a good option for further research and for investors who are looking for a high level of income There is risk and you have to be ok with the leverage interest rate sensitivity and credit risk but the fund makes big money You can see shares go to a penny in 6 years but as long as the dividends keep getting paid they should you will make your entire investment back in dividends in just 6 years Everything after that is simply gravySo what do you think Are you a reluctant shareholder Have you been buying for months or will this be your first purchase Have something else to recommend Let the community know belowBig income awaits you at Quad 7 Capital is a team of 9 analysts with a wide

182,Tesla: My Long-Term Bull Thesis (Rating Upgrade),A few days ago I was in a discussion with a friend about his recent   stock acquisition and told him I thought he would likely be quite happy with his purchase a decadeAs much as I am quite bullish on their longterm prospects when I wrote  on Tesla in April I was hesitant to place a buy rating because of a combination of their margin contraction  and our  However with the  providing significant  Teslas shortTesla produces electric vehicles solar panels and roof tiles and battery storage systems They are a leading developer of selfdriving software and have expanded into machine learning with the development of their own supercomputer  They maintain operations in the United States China and internationally The company was founded in 2003 and and is currently headquartered in Austin TexasTesla maintains an Automotive segment and an Energy Generation and Storage segment Their Automotive segment offers electric vehicles and ancillary products and services This segment includes their network of Superchargers and service locations inapp upgrades and mobile services financing and leasing services and warranties and extended service plansTheir Energy Generation and Storage segment provides photovoltaic generation storage products and related services It maintains a website as well as stores and galleries and also reaches customers through a network of channel partners They offer various financing options to their solar customersThe global electric vehicle EV market is projected to have a  until 2030 The global autonomous vehicle market is projected to have a  through 2032 The global electric vehicle charging station market is projected to have a  until 2033 The energy storage market is projected to have a  through 2028 The global photovoltaic market is projected have a  during the forecast periodTesla is in the process of improving its capabilities on multiple fronts They have been working toward full selfdriving FSD for many years As part of this effort  at their AI Day event on August 19 2021As progress continues on establishing superior reliability and safety capabilities it will eventually become clear that autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers Once a certain statistical threshold has been met insurance companies are going to be willing to offer lower rates to drivers who use proven autonomous driving softwareWhat I believe frequently gets overlooked is the pressure this will place on entities who operate large fleets of vehicles They will be financially incentivized to transition to autonomous capable vehicles While most of the auto industry has been working toward  of autonomous driving Tesla has a capability  If insurance companies are willing to offer users of Teslas software better rates this will incentivize Teslas competition to manufacture vehicles which are capable of running a variety of software packagesTheir Autopilot has access to more raw data than any of their competitors This gives them a significant lead on reaching full capability more quickly than any other autonomous driving software providerWe could witness an era where its common for people to buy a new Ford  General Motors  or Stellantis  vehicle equipped with Teslas autonomous driving software This may also produce an industry of third party entities which convert vehicles to be capable of using Teslas software Eventually any capability gap should close for those of their competitors who continue developing their own software packages so this period may only last a few years However the trend of vehicles being manufactured with multisoftware capability may continue even after the gap closes Being able to purchase a vehicle capable of using a variety of selfdriving software packages may eventually become standardWhile I am not clear as to when this threshold will be crossed The idea that Tesla might find themselves with a much larger market for their software than their own vehicles is extremely appealing The pressure would have to be significant for the other auto manufacturers to make the switch If the discounts the insurance companies are handing out are not deep enough we may not see an adoption or we may only experience a partial adoptionTesla is well positioned to benefit from ongoing changes in our energy grid The  is the most dominant factor at play when examining longterm energy infrastructure trendsWhen photovoltaics reached the status of  several years ago additional renewable capacity seems inevitable However the adoption of intermittent sources warps the daily supply and demand curve for wholesale electricity This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve Excessive overproduction from solar will damage portions of the grid This problem is severe enough that it is already common to disconnect portions of commercial scale capacity during the middle of the day I went into further detail about how this is affecting longterm trends related to our grid in my recent Tesla sits in a unique situation where they are involved in both grid scale storage as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence In places where a portion of the grid is supplied by photovoltaics storage providers are able to collect free or almostfree electricity in the middle of the day while the grid is overproducing This electricity can later be sold back into the market in the evening when they are at their highestWith the electricity collected at no cost or almost no cost the margins for such an operation are a function of the sheer volume one can manage divided by the maintenance costs for the batteries This means that storage providers are incentivized to gain access to as much overproduction as possible Over the next several decades I believe the electricity arbitrage industry has the potential to scale with the mass adoption of solar and will become incredibly lucrative Although its still far too early to tell how this situation will develop Tesla is currently well positioned to become a major player in this emerging industryTheir Autobidder continues to find opportunities in Australia Texas California and the UK The company cites the clear advantages of growing their footprint as each facility they build is expected to produce revenue for about 20 yearsIn 2022 their energy generation and storage segment  representing a 90 YoY increase to 1310 billion while the cost of revenues stands at 1151 billion This gives it a gross margin of 926 According to a  Autobidder has made over 330 million in trading revenues since inceptionTeslas most recent earnings call spoke of several longterm projects they have in the works They covered developments with the Cybertruck which they plan to launch later this year and also mentioned continued efforts toward developing a robotaxi They are pleased about the adoption of the North American Charging Standard Overall things have been going well for them in recent monthsTheir forward looking statements indicate that they expect Q3 to have lower revenue due to scheduled upgrades causing downtime through the summer monthsTeslas  has been growing at an impressive rate In 2013 they had an annual revenue of 20135M By 2022 that had grown to 81462M This represents a total increase of 39458 at an average annual rate of 4384Their annual margins have been improving over the last several years As of the most recent annual report gross margins were 2560 EBITDA margins were 2141 operating margins were 1681 and net margins were 1541Like many growing companies Tesla has been diluting to help fund expansion Total common shares outstanding was at 18464M in 2013 by the end of 2022 that rose to 3164M This represents a 714 rise in share count which comes out to an average annual rate of 793 Over that same time period operating income rose from 613M to 13692M Because it has come with significant improvements to income I view this dilution as accretiveTheir debt situation has been improving over the last several years As of the 2022 annual report they had 106M in net interest expense total debt was 5748M and longterm debt was 1029MAs of this most recent annual report cash and equivalents was 16253M operating income was 13692M EBITDA was 17439M net income was 12556M unlevered free cash flow was 43275M and levered free cash flow was 42081MTheir total equity has been growing quite quicklyAnnual returns have also been improving As of the most recent annual report ROIC was 2431 ROCE was 1764 and ROE was at 2736Their quarterly financials are showing significant revenue growth over the last two years Eight quarters ago Tesla had a quarterly revenue of 11958M Four quarters ago that had grown to 16934M By this most recent quarter that had grown to 24927M This represents a total twoyear rise of 1084 at an average quarterly rate of 136Their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 1819 EBITDA margins were 1425 operating margins were 962 and net margins were at 1084Their dilution rate appears to have dropped in more recent quarters The sum of their last eight quarters of dilution comes to 732 over the last four quarters this has dropped to 163Their debt situation is improving This most recent quarter Tesla had 210M in net interest expense total debt was at 5811M and longterm debt was at 504MTheir quarterly cash flow is inconsistent As of the most recent earnings report cash and equivalents were 15296M quarterly operating income was 2399M EBITDA was 3553M net income was 2703M unlevered free cash flow was 8944M and levered free cash flow was 8769MWhen viewed on a quarterly basis their total equity continues to riseTheir returns are trending in a similar pattern with their margins As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was 466 ROCE was 281 and ROE was 518As of October 11th 2023 Tesla had a market capitalization of 83673B and traded for 26299 per share They do not pay a dividend so using their  of 9103x and their  of 1972 I calculated a PEGY of 4616x and an Inverted PEGY of 02166x As the PEGY value is well above 1 this implies the company is presently significantly overvaluedHowever TSLA has a history of trading at elevated valuations They are currently trading with an EVEBITDA of 4873x When viewing their EVEBITDA over the last 5 years its clear that its present valuation is historically not as overvalued as it has reached in the pastTesla faces a large number of competitors A majority of the already established auto manufacturers on the planet are developing or already producing their own EVs and alternative fuel vehicles This developing industry has also attracted a significant number of speculative startups Because of Teslas first mover advantage and the time it will take to develop a viable product from nothing I expect that the effects of this increasing competitive pressure will come on graduallyAutonomous driving may take longer to reach full maturity than they expect Progress is expected to continue on its logistic growth curve with most of the easy breakthroughs having already been made The company already has a viable product but they need a huge amount of additional data and time to fine tune it and make further safety and reliability improvements It will likely be difficult to tell when they have actually crossed above the threshold where their FSD software can be called fully matureAs always with innovators Tesla runs the risk of overspending to stay relevant Developing their own hardware and software for machine learning may end up costing more than they expect or not be as profitable as they project The push to develop AI is spawning development across the industry and Tesla is merely one of many companies working on their own projects While I believe the decision to move into machine learning was good for the longterm health of the company its always possible the additional cost of joining the first movers will not be worth the benefitsTesla faces several catalysts most of which are not near term Tesla has cut prices several times earlier this year This should produce additional demand and help them capture market share Tesla has been normalizing electric vehicle use at some point we will cross the threshold where its more normal culturally to drive an electric or alternative fuel vehicle than a gasoline or dieselTeslas overall engineering quality is extremely high Tesla is several generations into EV development and their design philosophy has them continuously making performance improvements For a specific example of what I am referencing YouTube has videos of Sandy Munro comparing the thermal systems of the MachE and the Model Y They are eyeopeningAs stated above I believe demand for their FSD software will increase once the insurance providers are willing to offer discounts Organizations which maintain fleets of vehicles will have to justify not transitioning to the cheaper option This is likely to affect everyone from car rental companies and taxi services to government employees and utility vehicles Demand for FSD may also spur their competition into producing vehicles which are capable of using Teslas driverless softwareTesla is joining several others in the  These types of batteries are significantly cheaper than the Liion we are all accustomed to Tesla already operates a grid scale energy  The dramatic cost savings of IronAir batteries makes them a disruptive technology Our electric grid currently requires a significant contribution from base load providers As we increase its storage capacity I believe the bargaining power the base load providers currently have will diminish as most of the negotiating power will shift to the storage providersAlso storage providers will experience sustained tailwinds from the continued adoption of solar as they profit from  Because of their dramatically lower cost of production the adoption of ironair batteries should both lower cost of expansion and improve margins for their energy storage divisionTesla achieves rather high margins for a manufacturer As producers in other industries realize that the reason Tesla is achieving superior margins and return on capital is due to their preference for automated manufacturing the demand for Teslastyle facilities should rise The company could eventually open a subsidiary which establishes automated manufacturing facilities for other companiesNormally I refuse to place buy ratings on any company this overvalued However I believe the current UAW strike will provide continued tailwinds for Tesla Incs share price as it continues Add to this the fact that they have a history of achieving unreasonably high valuations and its present valuation becomes less of a concern This is one of the few occasions where I am willing to hand out a buy rating on a ticker when I am unable to clearly see that its trading below its intrinsic value I believe Tesla has unrecognized longterm growth potential so it potentially may have a hidden margin of safetyOverall Tesla Inc appears to be an extremely attractive investment because of their culture of adaptation and innovation While I cannot guarantee that their current endeavors will lead to future moats they have already established themselves as a premier EV producer and have the potential to find themselves with multiple high margin revenue streams Although their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters they have proven they are capable of producing attractive returnsI believe Tesla stock is likely to become the longterm compounder that its present investors hope it will be So even if buying at todays prices ends up being a lackluster entry in the short or medium term longterm Tesla Inc shareholders are unlikely to be punished for it   Past performance is no guarantee of future

183,The Catalysts Are Building For Bitcoin,In this article Im going to provide an update on the catalysts that are driving the tremendous upward momentum in the Bitcoin  price However each of these comes with risks that could cause Bitcoin price to reverseI believe that these catalysts have contributed to the increasing price of Bitcoin Furthermore since Bitcoins price is dependent on supply and demand dynamics it is possible to argue that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will reduce the upcoming Bitcoin supply the spot ETFs and increased utility will increase the demand for Bitcoin and hence the price of Bitcoin should go upBitcoin is up 135 since I recommendedUsing Bitcoin as a backend mechanism will serve to increase the demand for Bitcoin Given that more financial institutions use Bitcoin as a payment rail then these institutions will need to buy Bitcoin in order to process transactions Block Incs Cash App has integrated the Bitcoin lightning network onto Cash App and given Dorseys comments above I believe there is a significant chance that the company is working on a Bitcoin remittance solutionAnother usecase that is evolving for Bitcoin is a socalled sats economy The sats economy refers to using satoshis the smallest denomination of bitcoin to send small tips of appreciation to others on social media Damus used this model after it launched earlier this year however Apple  has forced Damus to shut this feature down during the summer  The problem with this use case is that it bypasses Apples rules for inapp payments This reflects the strength of the Bitcoin lightning network but also the complete pushback it has receivedFor these reasons I believe this catalyst is the weakest but also the most overlooked Although nothing very concrete has materialized yet within the utility use case it is likely soon to come and if it does the scale could be vastThe payments industry comprises many large and powerful players including Mastercard  Visa  and PayPal  How will they look upon Bitcoin as a future payment rail Will these companies adopt the technology or build their own offering to compete against it PayPal for example has a stablecoin called PAYUSD that developers are able to build new payment layers on top of This is very similar to the Bitcoin ecosystem and directly the opposite approach that Block Inc has taken Instead of building on and integrating the Bitcoin network into Venmo and PayPal the company has created its own Actions like this could undermine the eventual increase in demand for BitcoinIf you didnt already know Bitcoin is set to halve in April 2024 This implies that the reward for mining one Bitcoin will be cut in half in April effectively lowering the rate at which future supply enters the marketHistorically Bitcoin halvings have led to price increases in Bitcoin both  the halving occurs Notice this dynamic in the image belowEvery halving has been frontrun by significant price increases This is likely due to the supply and demand effect As more people realize that the Bitcoin halving is coming the more Bitcoin is bought which raises the price of the asset due to higher demand After Bitcoin halvings have occurred the price of the asset has gone up even more dramatically in generalWe are currently about five months away from the beginning of April and weve seen a very significant price increase over the past few months Since its January lows Bitcoin has doubled and since the end of September the Bitcoin price has increased by around 35 with steep increases in the past few daysAlthough Bitcoin halvings in the past have historically always correlated with increases in the Bitcoin price there is no rule that this has to be the case One risk with looking at the historical price action of Bitcoin is that the digital currency really doesnt have a long history Since its inception Bitcoin has only halved three times Why will this time be the sameThere are currently 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs pending application The applications are from Grayscale 21Shares  Ark BlackRock Bitwise VanEck WisdomTree WT Invesco IVZ Galaxy Fidelity Valkyrie Global X Hashdex and Franklin  These spot ETFs generally imply that investors will be able to take part in Bitcoins price development without buying Bitcoin directly Hence we can think of these brokeragesinvestment firms as distribution channels for Bitcoin The more distribution channels Bitcoin has the more consumers will be able to gain easy access to the digital asset This will clearly increase the demand for BitcoinIn fact Galaxy estimated in a research report that inflows into a Bitcoin ETF could amount to 14 billion in year one 27 billion in year two and 39 billion in year three Given the huge asset management industry it is likely that asset managers begin suggesting customers allocate a small portion of their wealth into this quickly growing digital goldIf we build upon Galaxys logic quickly 12 spot ETFs with 14 billion in inflows in year one would result in total inflows of 168 billion during the first year Galaxy found that the amount of Bitcoin held under management on September 30th was 217 billion or 43 of the current supply at the time If Galaxys calculations are correct the ETF adoption would imply an almost 8x increase in the amount of Bitcoin held under management with regard to monetary value Personally I believe that this could be a little bit of a stretch target which the research report also admits if Bitcoin spot ETF approvals are delayed or denied our analysis would be altered by timing and access restriction Or if poor price performance or any other factor leads to lowerthanexpected access or adoption to a bitcoin ETF our estimates could prove too aggressiveInsofar the SEC has not accepted any of the spot Bitcoin ETFs which means that much of the Bitcoin price increase could be built upon a false sense of hope The SEC still hasnt approved anything citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud  On top of this the greed index which was mentioned in a recent Seeking Alpha news article suggests that the greed of Bitcoinbuying has reached the highest point since November 2021 Based on the discussion of each of the three catalysts above we can presume that if all of the catalysts fall in place around the same time Bitcoin prices will receive strong momentum This will likely not be the case for the utility catalyst for Bitcoin since I believe this is a longterm development that we may see as Bitcoin becomes more built into offerings at existing companies However the Bitcoin halving is certain This catalyst is likely the strongest since it has historically always meant that Bitcoin prices will rise If the halving event is coupled with the regulatory acceptance of spot ETFs demand would increase potentially by a lot as claimed by Galaxy and the rate of supply will contract causing the price to increaseIn all I remain just as bullish on Bitcoin as a longterm investment as I did during the summer when I published my first article on the digital asset As opposed to then halving is nearly in sight and the general reception of potential spot Bitcoin ETFs has been really positive To me these are signals that indicate that Bitcoin can continue rising but the uncertainty of whether spot ETFs are accepted or not makes this catalyst relatively weak on its own My belief however is that asset management firms are doing everything they can to influence the acceptance of these ETFs as it would give the institutions more money and a potentially broader customer base For these reasons I rate Bitcoin a buy as a longterm investment with both short and long term catalysts on the horizon   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No

184,What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,First and foremost the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination This article is not about politics and it will not focus on whats right or wrong Instead we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent as of this writing are up 3 with WTI  trading above 85 and Brent above 87 Initially at the close of Friday WSJ published a report noting that the US is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high Soon after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel If you want to thoroughly review the events Some of you may wonder what does this have to do with oil Historically speaking geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions In this case Israel is not a major oil producer so whats the catch The catch in our view has to do with Irans potential involvement in this whole ordeal WSJ published a piece noting that Irans senior officials helped plan this attack months agoWhile the US has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on IranFor starters we need context to what we are writing In June  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market Since then IEA has confirmed via its figures that Irans oil production is close to 31 million bd Our supply  demand model assumes 33 million bd and official Iranian figures support that production is around 33 million bdPutting all of this together Iran is exporting close to 2 million bd Visible tanker exports account for 15 to 16 million bd while shadow exports account for 400k bdSince H2 2022 the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports As we wrote earlier in the year this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storageWith floating storage gone and crude exports back to 2 million bd 500 to 800k bd below the previous peak whats the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward Perhaps the US does nothing and leaves Iran as is but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view while the risk of a major loss is low we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months We think the average would fall from 2 million bd to 16 million bd In terms of visible tankers this means Irans crude exports would drop closer to 12 million bdWhile it wont be much of a decline it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into yearend and possibly well into H1 2024Looking at our latest supply  demand update we made a few important assumption changesIn essence global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by monthend And if the US starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports then our balance could surprise to the upside But with a deficit of 22 million bd the lack of production decline from Iran wont make that much of a difference eitherOn the other hand with no mega deal on the horizon between Israel and Saudi the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis wont be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least 110bbl With Brent trading at 87 we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a realityIn conclusion global oil inventories should accelerate downward But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession Fund flows will ebb and flow so oil prices wont skyrocket anytime soon Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception Until then we see prices grinding higher with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levelsFor readers looking to add energy stocks Q4 will provide ample opportunities We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil Consolidation and MA are heating up so you will see more and more mergers announced But more importantly always remember that with these oil prices the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist Please be patient fundamentals are on your sideFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are

185,Sibanye Stillwater Hopes To Offer A Metal Mosaic,Sibanye Stillwater  is a South African metals company with hopes of significant expansion in the next 5 years Through investment in both recycling and production initiatives globally SBSW hopes to become a linchpin in the global metals marketGiven its rising demand significant investments in battery metals especially Lithium are critical for future growth While electric vehicles are gaining popularity a mix including hybrids will dominate the next decade still providing tailwinds to PGM recycling and PGM mining businesses SBSW will spend an estimated 500 million in FY23 on these expansion initiativesDespite the challenges faced by SBSW in the short term the company shows promising potential for longterm growthEFV Estimated Fair Value

the most attention a mix of EVs including hybrids are needed to fulfil demand within the next decade Light vehicle production climbs to 825 million units per year in FY23 The PGM market is expected to see significant demand recovery linked with the Chinese auto sales rebound expected in FY23 still originate from Russia and there is still some uncertainty about Russias place in the global economy While much of Russias PGM capacity remains unsanctioned that could change and further affect the supply and demand dynamics of the marketAmerican PGM operations are still ramping up with SBSW ramping production to 700koz of 2E PGM by 2027 Shortterm sustaining costs have surged amid regional flooding and a shaft collapse which caused a work stoppage which will resume in 2H23 SBSW states this is temporary and expects leveling off of AISC by FY26 of under 990oz SBSW expects the American PGM segment to return to full profitability in late FY23 or in FY24 when all in sustaining costs return to normalized levelsThe South African PGM operation is the largest segment by revenue and is considered mature Currently the segment has 4 active mines and 3 exploration operations Expansion in this segment includes the K4 expansion to Marikana South Africa facility This will add 50 years of output at an estimated 250koz per year once full capacity is reached in FY29SBSW PGM cost relative to peers SBSW is highlighted in BlueBefore the acquisition of Stillwater Sibanye was an exclusive gold producer SBSW still seeks to streamline its operations in this area acquiring a controlling stake in DRDGOLD  a tailings management company SBSW will close underperforming mines to reduce capital costs and make room for new greenfield expansion After FY23 SBSW expects the capital requirements to significantly decrease for the Gold segment amounting to 547 million annually in savings due to these streamlining actionsGold production for FY23 is expected to produce 756788koz at an allin sustaining cost of 1826oz The average realized price for 2Q23 for gold was 1864ozExpansion in this area is the Burnstone project believed to be able to output 141koz per year at full capacity in FY25 Existing local infrastructure significantly reduces startup costs with the first production output expected in 2H23 DRDGOLD is a tailings management company recovering residue metals from waste from the mine It has a far lower sustaining cost of 1528oz with an annual output of 179koz This portfolio addition could increase cash flow by 55 million per year at full production capacity in FY25The battery metals segment encompasses Nickel Copper and Lithium operations SBSW seeks to create a raw materials presence closest to regional United States and Europe ecosystemsIn Finland a concentrated 7 mine facility has been approved for mining and broke ground in March of FY23 SBSW has a 79 controlling interest in the operation and hopes to achieve 15000 metric tons annually in FY25 The facility is concentrated on a deposit of Lithium Hydroxide which demands a price premium compared to Lithium Carbonate The reason is extracting and refining Lithium Hydroxide is much more expensive The current price assumption for the 15year life of the mine is 26034 per metric ton with an average operating cost of 7423 per metric ton in all in sustaining costs Total capital expenditure less sustaining capital is expected to be 650 million This has the chance to be a highly profitable venture in a strategic area close to numerous battery factories in EuropeThe Sandouville Nickel Refinery was acquired with 100 controlling interest in FY22 The facility is designed to refine 16000 tons of nickel and 600 tons of Cobalt This location is strategically close to a site set to be Frances first gigafactory built and operated by Verkor in a partnership with Renault SBSW invested 275 million in the gigafactory as wellRhyolite Ridge in the United States is a lithiumboron project in Nevada The project has a nameplate capacity of 22000 metric tons annually assuming an average price of 13000 per metric ton for Lithium and 710 per metric ton for Boron SBSW has pledged to contribute funding in exchange for 50 interest conditional to permitting approval The permitting environment for lithium exploration has become more favorable in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act with the Department of Energy offering a loan of 700 million The project has attracted large names including the Toyota and Panasonic JV Ford and South Korean battery maker Eco Pro Ford has committed to take 35 of production from FY25FY30The top two risks facing SBSW in the short term are labor disputes and South African power infrastructureNumerous disruptions in FY22 caused by South African workers protesting poor working conditions and low wages While these have settled SBSW could be at risk of disruption again once the contract is up for renegotiation in FY25The South African power company ESKOM has been plagued with fuel supply problems sabotage and aging components This has caused them to embark on a program of load shedding turning off power after peak hours Mining smelting and refining consume roughly 30 of ESKOMs net power output Thus ESKOM on top of load shedding has increased power prices by 20 In the medium term ESKOM will remain a primary power supplier to the SA Mining segments ESKOM expects load shedding to ramp up through FY23 which could result in 15 production losses At the end of FY24 SBSW expects enough privatesector electricity generation to eliminate load shedding for the mining industry To this effect SBSW has acquired the largest solar farm in South Africa set to enter initial production in FY25 with 89MW in nameplate capacityUnderpinning these is ongoing political instability in South Africa While SBSW is quickly diversifying out of South Africa it is still a South African company We will likely see some form of price action after the Lithium demand will grow by  There will be a 55 gap between supply and demand for Lithium at the current global capacity The story is similar but not as grim for nickel with an 8 gap between supply and demand This fact will put upward pressure on the prices of nickel and Lithium as the decade continues Additionally PGM metals in use with existing nonbattery EVs and traditional ICE vehicles will continue to put upward pressure on prices Even at an aggressive growth assumption EVs of all types are not expected to pass 40 market share Despite lowerthanexpected output in FY22 and 1H23 the foundations for significant longterm growth are in place SBSW has a very strong balance sheet with only a reported 014x debt to adjusted EBITDA and around 630 million in free cash flow Additionally it pays out a sector high 854 yield targeting 35 of earnings paid out to shareholdersSBSW is undergoing a transformative effort to broaden global holdings and cut stalling operations For this reason we think it is attractive at

186,Archer-Daniels-Midland Hasn't Been This Attractive Since The Great Financial Crisis,Its time to talk about one of my favorite agriculture stocks ArcherDanielsMidland  The company which just reported its quarterly numbers is doing extremely well It benefits from multiple industry tailwinds including strong secular growth in biofuelsIn thisSo lets get to itRoughly a month ago I wrote an  titled  In that article I highlighted the companys massive footprint in the agriculture industryListed in 1924 the company has roughly 750 facilities and 42000 employees that manage 440 crop procurement locations allowing sellers and buyers in the agriculture industryAs shown in the overview the company connects buyers and sellers and produces essential products for most food items sold in grocery storesThis includes oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions which account for the biggest part of the companys revenueIn the United States ArcherDanielsMidland is the thirdlargest producer of ethanol according to With this in mind earlier this week major European bank ING  that this industry is in a very good positionThe bank believes that the biofuel industry in the United States is poised for substantial growth driven by evolving supply and demand dynamics primarily shaped by government policiesAs one can imagine this development is of particular importance to American farmers and biofuel producers who are witnessing a surge in the demand for agricultural feedstocks in the biofuel sectorAs biofuels replace conventional fossil fuels in transportation and aviation various biobased feedstocks including agricultural crops and animalderived products are becoming critical for achieving sustainability goals and netzero emissions by 2050Like many people I am not a fan of using food to produce fuel but in light of global energy policies my opinion doesnt matterFurthermore while cornbased ethanol initially gained momentum due to Renewable Fuel Standards RFS and LowCarbon Fuel Standards LCFS in the mid2000s there is now a remarkable shift towards alternative feedstocks driven by the growth of renewable diesel productionMeanwhile increased refining capacity has led to rising demand for animal fats and used cooking oil as well as soybean and canola oil further used in renewable dieselThis shift has even led to renewable diesel production surpassing biodiesel production in 2023Adding to that the new Inflation Reduction Act IRA provides tax credits to the biofuels industry extending existing credits for biodiesel and introducing new credits for sustainable aviation fuelsIn this light during last years JP Morgan AllStars Conference the company noted that it has benefited from robust demand in biofuels with strong biodiesel margins high demand for ethanol and increased use of soybean oil in green diesel plants which confirms the trends noticed by INGThe company also mentioned the startup of a new soybean crushing plant in North Dakota which will add 15 million tons of capacity focusing on lowcarbon intensity feedstocksFurthermore the company is actively working on decarbonization efforts including carbon capture and sequestration expansions and agreements with partners like Warwick Carbon Solutions to provide lowcarbon emissions powerIn the third quarter ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of 163 accompanied by an adjusted segment operating profit of 15 billionNotably this quarters results contributed to an outstanding yeartodate adjusted earnings per share of 562 making it the secondbest EPS year in the first nine monthsAdditionally ADMs trailing 4quarter average adjusted return on invested capital stood at 132 which reflects the companys consistent strength in this environmentADM also acknowledged the dynamic nature of the global market where opportunities and challenges coexist which makes it challenging for traders and investorsConsumer behavior trends vary across categories impacting spendingIssues also include geopolitical tensions inflation and fluctuating commodity supply and demandDespite these challenges ADM continues to build on the momentum achieved yeartodate with plans to surpass its 2023 expectations for the total companyWith that in mind ADMs different business units showed robust performance in light of both tailwinds and headwindsDuring its earnings call the company emphasized that its competitive advantage lies in its broad and integrated business model that spans from farm to fork which is something I already briefly mentionedIn 2023 ADM capitalized on its extensive global origination network partnering with farmers worldwide to offer traceable sustainable crop sources for customers like PepsiCo  Nestle and CarlsbergThe company aims to enroll 4 million regenerative acres by 2025 equivalent to powering over 100000 homes annuallyADM is prepared to meet the demand for renewable fuel with initiatives like Spiritwood JV and Broadwind Energy project contributing to lower carbon emissions and the need for greener fuelsThe company also has a robust balance sheet with an adjusted net debttoEBITDA leverage ratio of 09x which provides them with financial flexibility to drive their longterm strategic agenda and return capital to shareholdersIt enjoys a credit rating of AADM has raised its 2023 earnings outlook and anticipates fullyear EPS in excess of 7 per shareBased on that context ArcherDanielsMidland currently pays a 045 per share per quarter dividend This translates to 180 per year It implies a 26 2023E earnings payout ratio which is extremely healthyThe dividend yield is 25ADM is attractively valued As we can see in the FAST Graphs chart below the normalized PE ratio is 146x which has been a steady guide for the company for the past few decadesNow the company is trading at 95x earnings Thats the lowest valuation since the great financial crisisEven if earnings moderate in the next few years analysts expect mild contraction after three stellar years the stock is significantly undervaluedA return to its normal valuation could technically result in 18 annual returns through 2025The current consensus price target is 97 which is 38 above the current priceHence I stick to what I wrote in my prior article I believe that ADM has a fair value between 100 and 110 which I expect the company to reach over the next three to four yearsArcherDanielsMidland is standing strong as a promising investment in the agriculture sector The booming biofuel industry supported by evolving government policies presents a significant growth opportunity for ADMTheir diversified business model has enabled them to weather market challenges and capitalize on global demand for sustainable crop sourcesADMs strong financial performance improved earnings outlook and healthy dividend payout ratio make it an attractive investment With its current undervaluation and a potential return to normal valuation ADM could offer investors an 18 annual return through 2025Hence I maintain my belief in ADMs fair value between 100 and 110 which I anticipate the company achieving in the next three to four yearsJoin  today to get

187,The Most Common Misconception About REIT Investing In This Environment,As many of my readers have probably noticed lately I have paid a very close attention to the REIT balance sheets and debt financing structuresI think that restrictive interest rates for a long period of timeEveryone who has invested a bit of his or her time into exploring how equity REITs work understands that the chances of finding the next Nvidia or Apple by picking any REIT out there are extremely slimInstead REITfocused investors can play a more balanced and predictable game which is underpinned by to a large extent a predictable business model and cash generation profileREITs per definition regulation have to devise a buy and hold strategy where a notable portion of the collected cash flows rents or leases have to be regularly distributed to the shareholdersThe main ways how REITs can increase the cash flows are the followingBesides increasing the rents  leases organically or conducting noncore activities such as positive debt refinancing the key essence of REIT business is to capture a positive spread between asset or investment IRR and the cost of capitalIf the spread widens REITs are deep in the moneyIf the spread remains stable REITs deliver stable and positive resultsIf the spread decreases REITs fallSince the early 2022 the overall cost of financing has gradually increased sending the broader REIT index in a negative return territoryOne might argue that this decline is mostly explained by the struggling office sector and if the office segment was excluded the remaining REIT space would be in a nice position relative to the early 2022Well not exactly right In the chart above we can see some of the most popular REITs operating outside of the realm of office segment and that have still delivered returns which are significantly below the SP 500All in all the key message here is that REITs are extremely sensitive to the changes in the interest rate levels as any movement in the cost of capital makes a huge impact on the underlying cash generation profileIn most of my recent articles I have incorporated a huge skew towards assessing the potential implications of higher cost of capitalWhy Because I think that the higher for longer scenario and higher interest rates in general embody a significant potential to destroy huge chunks of FFO for many REITs out thereThe following are the main avenues through which this risk is most likely set to render a painful impactOtherwise at this stage REITs are protected from additional headwinds that are associated with higher cost of capital as the effects from unhedged floating debt instruments have already been reflected in the latest financialsIn my view refinancings at higher interest rates is the most critical issueLet me depict the  via one very common REIT Realty Income Corporation Currently O has around 65 billion of debt excluding the floating portion and the assumption of organic dept repayment that has to be refinanced by 2026As of Q2 2023 O had a weighted average cost of financing at 37 which is considerably below the market level financing costLooking at the prevailing YTM of some of the Os outstanding bonds we get an average cost of financing around 64 72 of an increaseIf we assign the prevailing cost of financing level to the maturing debt proceeds until 2026 ie reprice according to the market level Os FFO would decrease by  175 million or by 6 taking TTM FFO as a basis This in turn would send the FFO payout ratio higher to 80 levelIf we take a more extreme scenario and reprice all of the remaining 12 billion to the 64 interest rate level the effects would be very severe impairing Os longterm growth prospects In other words completely justifying the recent price declineRemember that via this example we see the potential consequences for a REIT which has an upper investment grade credit rating relatively wellladdered debt maturity profile and a significant scale which introduces flexibility in the financing processes For many REITs the debt situation looks much worseFinally we come to the point where I want to emphasize a very popular misconception in the context of REITs and the potential consequences of higher interest ratesThe challenge stems from the misunderstanding of the rate of change effects More specifically many REIT investors carry a concept that REITs are a natural hedge of the inflation due to the rents  leases that adjust to the inflation levels accordinglyThis coupled with the generally correct fact that many REITs exhibit favourable supply and demand dynamics  especially now when building new supply has become very expensive  leads to an opinion that the growing interest costs will be easily offset by a synchronized movement in the top lineAs a result many REIT investors have become overly complacent and do not fully appreciate the potential consequencesNow my argument is that while all this is correct it does not really move the needle in the context of surging interest expensesSince the early 2022 O has managed to deliver a superb growth in its topline registering a couple of very strong quarterly results In total from Q1 2022 to Q2 2023 Os operating income grew by 34 And for all of the reasons many REIT investors mention  eg embedded rent escalators which kick in nicely during inflationary period and favourable supply and demand dynamicsHowever despite the solid growth numbers the share of the interest expense component relative to the operating income has become larger And now let me remind you that the current cost of debt sitting in Os books is still nowhere near the market level and that during most of these quarters the interest rates were actually much lower than we currently have given that the Fed was still in the aggressive hiking processTo contrast O which is an Arated REIT with a smaller REIT which has not an IG balance sheet I have taken the Global Medical REIT  as an exampleAs we can see the higher interest costs have consumed a significant portion of GMREs operating income despite the fact that the Company has embedded rent escalators for almost all of its contracts Moreover GMRE operates on a net lease basis just as O which protects the earnings from other inflationary costsBoth in O and GMREs case the occupancy levels have remained robust at their peaks and there have been successful increases in the topline Yet both companies have still significantly lower cost of financing recorded at their books currently and first notable maturities are slowly but surely approach their deadlinesI recommend REIT investors to revisit the theoretically correct yet practically insignificant thesis that rent  lease indexation to inflation or rent increases in general serve as meaningful mitigates to the higher for longer scenario for REITs Mathematically and based on the actual results organic growth in rents or leases is not sufficient to protect many REITs from a gradual convergence to higher cost of capital and the resulting consequences   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether

188,"Forget The Hype, W. P. Carey Is An Absolute Bargain",Rising interest rates are a phenomenon remembered by few market participantsthe last time interest rates experienced sustained upward momentum was 40 years ago The subsequent reduction of interest rates after the US inflationary crisis of the 1970sREITs along with other capital and debtintensive industries were primary beneficiaries of this longterm trend and have thusly been slapped in the proverbial face as interest rates rise The office sector has been doubly slapped by rising interest rates and the COVID pandemic which ushered in remote and hybrid work en masse The sector has yet to recover to even a fraction of its prepandemic highs and is now faced with the daunting prospect ofUnderstanding the direness of the situation management at W P Carey  announced in September 2023 that the company would The method of the spinoff is the main contention here as many  have  Essentially W P Carey management did two thingsThe first point here seems to be the cardinal sin As  in his recent article on W P CareyThis we think is true when placed in the proper context which is the interest rate discussion we started this article withYesdividend cutters did not prosper in a falling rate environment That only makes sense right After all if youre cutting your payout as your cost of capital is falling then the overwhelming likelihood is that your business is suffering Cutting payouts in a  interest rate environment is a very different animal and we would contend a sign of prudent managementOthers have also pointed out what W P Carey did not slash its dividend in the Great Financial Crisis of 20072008 a line of reasoning intended to invoke in the reader a thought of wow things must  be bad then In our view this thinking is flawed The GFC as painful as it was and despite what our collective memories may tell us did not have the same devastating force as the Great Depression and active government intervention shielded many industries and companies from massive amounts of pain Additionally the GFC did not affect all asset classes equally and lastly rates fell overall during the GFC enabling companies to roll debt at even cheaper pricesIn response to a question about the dividend on  to address the office spinoff CFO Toni Ann Sanzone had this to saySo yes while dividend cuts are generally bad news we think the rationale from management makes sense especially in the long runThe second issuethat the companys spinoff would be meant to simply sell its assets over timeseems to us to just be an admission of reality on the part of management The market for office space is unlikely to return to equilibrium anytime soon due to a massive imbalance of supply and demand What we ask would you rather have in this situation A lameduck child company that limps along in constant need of attention and funding or a company designed to sell the assets and close up shop once the maximum amount of capital has been collected for investorsWe think the latter is a far better optionNow we dont think the analysis conducted on this site regarding W P Carey is  in the sense that longterm investors have every right to feel as jilted as they do The stock has performed poorly after all and it is only natural that the office spinoff and dividend target reduction would feel like a rugpull Thus todays levels for sure represent an inflection point for longterm holders of W P CareyFor new investors however we think the opportunity may be quite enticingFirst an historic discrepancy has emerged between the companys stock price and its forward EBITDA estimates For most of the last 10 years minus the start of the COVID pandemic W P Careys stock traded well above its forward EBITDA expectations Since the start of 2023 the stock has endured a precipitous decline while forward EBITDA estimates have moderately  The most recent drop in EBITDA estimates appears to reflect the spinoffThe popular narrative surrounding W P Careythat the company is slowtonogrowth and that the primary reason for wanting to own it is for its dividendalso doesnt appear to hold up particularly wellOver the last five years the company has generated a 143 CAGR on sales While yes this number is below bestinclass Realty Income  and slightly worse than STAG Industrial  it is also not insignificant and has been on the upswingPerhaps more importantly for those with a long term perspective W P Carey has managed to produce a better return on capital for its shareholders coming in at 32 for the latest quarter a full 113 basis points above Realty Incomes quarterly ROCLastly  the stock is attractive on a forward PFFO and PAFFO basis The stock currently trades hands at 979x PFFO and 1022x PAFFO which is 7 and 21 lower than the current sector median This we think is a reflection of the negative sentiment swirling around the stockYear to date W P Carey has been a disappointment for shareholders delivering a 27 negative total return While we understand why longterm holders of the stock may no longer find the story appealing we think that newcomers to the company are likely to find a lot to like in the current valuation and outlook for the

189,Vonovia Is Likely To Benefit From Undersupply In Germany,Dear readers  is one of my favorite stocks to write about and one that occupies the biggest position in my real estate  REIT portfolio Ive studied the stock quite extensively over the pastMost recently I shared an update following Vonovias Q2 2023 earnings   reiterating my BUY rating at EUR 22 per share for the native shares ticker VNAIm now more than 20 in profit excl dividends on my position with a breakeven under EUR 18 per share with no intention to sell before my EUR 40 price target That leaves 80 of upside to a price target which really is quite conservative making Vonovia a worthwhile investment even at todays pricesI think that the one thing that often keeps people from investing in Vonovia is lack of knowledge of the local German market The focus here is on the supply and demand dynamics and especially on rent regulation which I believe is a key piece of the puzzle hereToday I want to show you why I have  that Germany will experience substantial undersupply of housing over the next 5 years which will inevitably benefit Vonovia and other residential landlordsJust as any other market in the world the German residential market is driven by supply and demand with a sparkle of regulation over the long termLets start with supply of new apartments Theres only one reason why developers build new housing  to make money When input construction and energy costs increase developers are faced with a choice They can try to pass through these input cost increases onto the final customers by increasing the sale prices or they can halt their development plansIn tough economic conditions with high inflation and a weakening consumer its quite unlikely that new apartments would sell at higher prices In fact housing prices have already started coming down from their peak in early 2022Faced with no other choice this has led many developers to postpone their construction plans which has led to a significant drop in the number of issued building permits one of the best proxies for future new supplyNote that the data below is monthly so in normal years about 3000000 units are permitted per year This year that number is likely to be below 250000 and unless the economy improves drastically I expect no more than 200000 permitted units in 2024The result is that only about 250000 new units are expected to be delivered to the market this year In the following years this number may fall somewhat lower before recovering closer to the 300000 unit longterm average But even 300000 units per year isnt nearly enough to cover the demand which is expected at 500700 thousand units per yearThat may seem like a high number so lets break it downDemand for housing is first and foremost driven by population growth The natural population in Germany has been declining for a long time but immigration has been high and has resulted in a 04 annual population growth over the last 10 years Recently this growth has been accelerated by  the government passing immigration reform laws in an effort to increase immigration to fight labor shortages and especially by  the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has resulted in unprecedented 13 population growth in 2022 Going forward the population is expected to grow by 022 Going forward the population is expected to grow by 0506 per yearOn top of population growth there are two trends worth mentioning Firstly urbanization which isnt stopping any time soon and is likely to disproportionately benefit Vonovia whose portfolio is located primarily in places that are seeing population growth Secondly the downsizing of households Back in 2011 there were on average 2 people in every household That number has dropped to 194 today and is expected to decline further to 189 by 2035 adding additional 02 of demand per yearBetween population growth and these trends it is estimated that demand for housing will average 500700 ths units per year which is a far cry from what will be constructed And because you cannot simply pull new apartments out of a hat  for the foreseeable future and will only be magnified if the ruling party manages to pass  for more stringent rent regulation which would only discourage more developersWhat does all this mean for VonoviaFirstly as the housing shortage keeps prices high a large portion of the German population will rent out of necessity which is likely to result in ongoing near perfect occupancy of 98 Secondly with fewer apartments on the market existing real estate will be more valuable leading to higher prices which should help get the stock closer to its NAV of EUR 40In the shortterm the stock price will continue to be driven by interest rates expectations and sentiment But over the long term the value of the companys assets acts as a very strong magnet and the valuation will eventually reflect this Severe undersupply is one of the key reasons why I dont mind being overweight Vonovia at these depressed

190,Buy REITs Before Everyone Else Does,A fundamental truism of investing in stocks is that capturing maximal gains from an investment requires buying it  the crowd doesIdeally an investor would buy a full position in a stock when its down then other investors will gradually orThat sounds nice  but in reality human psychology often gets in the way We are tribal creatures and going against the tribe in hopes that they will follow feels uncomfortable and unnatural In most areas of life it doesnt make sense to go against the crowd Thats why for most of us investing is a learned skill instead of an innate talentI would argue that incomeoriented investors and dividend growth investors have a rare opportunity right now to buy ahead of the crowd That opportunity is in realThere has been a 35 drop in the REIT index measured below by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  since the beginning of 2022This selloff has been inversely correlated with the movements of the 10year Treasury yield which has soared over that time periodREITs are than just bond alternatives Unlike bonds REITs offer inflation protection from property value appreciation and rent growth which generally flow into rising dividends But despite my  to the contrary the market still treats them like bond proxies as exemplified by the tight inverse correlation between REIT stock prices and bond yields as seen aboveIn what follows Im going to argue that interest rates have or are very close to peaking that the Fed is done with the current hiking cycle that interest rates are likely to come down in 2024 and that this will be the catalyst for REITs to shift from  to There are multiple reasons why Treasury yields have surged so much such as government deficit spending and fading demand from foreign buyers but I would argue the primary catalyst for rising rates is the Federal ReserveSince April 2022 the Fed has dumped over 1 trillion of debt securities most of which were Treasuries off its balance sheet That has created artificially high supply of Treasuries as rates have risen just as the Feds asset buying program created artificial  for Treasuries when rates were low andor fallingPlus demand for Treasuries is driven largely by what the Fed  doing and  of what the Fed is  with the Fed Funds Rate The coordinated higher for longer narrative from Fed officials in recent months has done exactly what it was intended to do cause longterm interest rates to riseThe Fed thinks this will help anchor inflation back at its 2 target rate I think this move will end up doing more harm than goodThe fact of the matter is that The market briefly panicked over the hotter than expected inflation data in the September reading But the 37 headline CPI rate is only that high because of the shelter component which lags realtime changes in rents by about a yearCompare the YoY growth in US shelter CPI gold line below to the Zillow Rent Index red lineIn September shelter CPI still showed 71 YoY growth but we know from Zillow that actual YoY rent growth was only 32Apartment Lists latest  shows an even lower rent growth metric of 12 for SeptemberThe same story holds true for home prices Using  most recent data from July 2023 median home listing prices  09 while the SP CaseShiller index showed a 10 YoY gainHowever you measure realtime housing cost changes  shelter inflation is far below the 71 YoY rate reported in the CPIAnd the shelter component of headline CPI represents about 35 of the overall index Thus about 25 percentage points of the 37 CPI rate came from this inaccurate shelter inputWhat was the CPI rate in September if you exclude this lagging shelter component Answer 199The biggest reason there has been a slight bounce in CPI ex shelter since June is the rebound in oil prices but even this appears to be temporary Recently the International Energy Agency  that oil prices near 100 caused meaningful demand destruction hence the stagnant price now in the 80sIf instead of the CPIs inaccurate 71 YoY growth in shelter costs you used Zillows 32 YoY rent growth number headline CPI would be 24If you used Apartment Lists 12 number you would get a headline CPI reading of 09 for SeptemberInflation has already been whipped Its just a matter of time before it shows up in the official data and the Fed acknowledges itBoth the forward SOFR curve and the Feds dot plot shows interest rates on the short end coming down slowly next year I think the drop in interest rates will be much faster and sharper than the market seems to think because I believe we will get a recession in the near futureAnytime in modern history that the Fed has hiked rates this fast it has precipitated a recession And during every recession in modern history the Fed has pushed rates down quickly and significantly by an average of about 500 basis pointsTherefore shouldnt the burden of proof be on those who claim contrary to the historical record that the Fed will be able to achieve a soft landing avoid recession and ease the Fed Funds Rate down slowly over the course of several yearsEven if Im wrong and the Fed does ease the FFR down slowly over the course of a few years I still think this will put downward pressure on Treasury yields across the curve as the lagged shelter inflation falls and allows CPI readings to come down furtherNow with all of the above said recall my earlier point that the market treats REITs like bond proxiesIf REITs fall because interest rates rise then what should happen when interest rates begin declining whether fast or slowOf course some investors will object that a recession would be bad for REITs causing an  selloff This is pure conjecture and not very well informed conjecture at that This objection seems to imply that every recession will be just like the Great Financial Crisis of 20082009 which was very damaging to real estate and REITsBut most economic forecasts today see a milder recession on the horizon more akin to the short and shallow recession of 2001How did REITs perform through that recession Answer swimminglyThe Fed quickly pushed down the FFR in response to economic weakness which corresponded with a drop in longterm interest ratesFrom April 2000 through June 2022 the Vanguard Real Estate Index  gained 35 155 annualized while real estate stalwarts like Realty Income  Alexandria Real Estate Equities  and W P Carey  gained even moreThe line of thinking above isnt some sophistry Im using to try to bail out my underwater REIT positions As if anything I write could move the markets anyway This is my actual view I

191,Why U.S. Treasury Bond Yields Will Continue To Rise,The year 2023 has been a tough one for bond investorsThe Bloomberg Aggregate Index has posted a 143 return YTD through October 13th Following losses of 154 in 2021 and 1301 in 2022 the Aggregate Index is on track for its thirdMuch of the focus has been on the Fundamental economic factors that affect the bond marketAlthough the Feds favorite inflation measure has declined from its peak of 56 in Feb 2022 the Core PCE came in at a still high 39 last month Core PCE has remained above the Feds inflation target of 20 for 30 consecutive monthsThis has been the primary reason why the Fed has been so aggressive with tightening monetary policy Between March 2022 and theThe possibility of another rate hike is still on the table for this yearThe Fed is concerned with the stickiness of the inflation rate and the resiliency of the economy Many have been predicting a recession due to the Feds tightening but the economy seems quite robust as evidenced by the surprising surge in nonfarm payrolls of 336000 as released by the BLS on October 6 This was markedly stronger than the 267000 average gain in new jobs over the prior 12 months and the forecasted level of 170000While many have been anticipating for more than a year a Fed pivot by cutting rates with such a durable jobs market the Feds fear is that such a move would stimulate the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy like housing autos and consumer borrowing which would then reignite inflationThe Fed has been using the mantra of higher for longer with regards to their rate policy for quite some time and only recently has it begun to sink inWhen Fed Chairman Powell says the Fed will be data dependent at future FOMC meetings he is referring to these Fundamental economic factorsThere is another dimension however that is also impacting the bond market and in my view is the major reason why US Treasury bond yields will continue to rise and these are the Technical factors that affect bond yieldsOne of the basic elements of economics is the Law of Supply and Demand and with regard to US Treasury bonds I will discuss how his Technical factor impacts yieldsThe largest owner of US Treasury bonds is the Federal Reserve From 2008 through 2022 during the Feds fourteenyear experiment with Quantitative Easing QE the Fed had a voracious appetite for Treasury bonds Their Treasury bond holdings surged from 481 billion in 2008 to 59 trillion in 2022The Feds share of US Treasury Bonds owned by the public jumped from 76 to 255During the pandemic when QE was reinstituted to prevent the economy from collapsing as everything was shut down the Fed was virtually the only buyer of government bonds With the entire yield curve yielding less than 1 due to the Feds aggressive easing the Fed bought 53 of the net new government debt issued to stimulate the economyBut then inflation reared its ugly head and the Fed began reversing course In addition to raising the Fed Funds rate to 550 the Fed began a policy normalization program more commonly referred to as Quantitative Tightening QT The goal of QT is to reduce the size of the Feds balance sheet This was to be accomplished through allowing their Treasury bonds to rolloff at a pace of 60 billion per month QT was announced in March 2022 and since then the Feds Treasury bond holdings have declined to just under 50 trillion or 198 of publicly held Treasury debtThe Fed is committed to continuing QT for the foreseeable futureThe next largest individual owners of Treasury bonds are Japan and China At their peaks both countries each owned well over 1 trillion Treasury bonds Chinas ownership topped out at 12 trillion in 2013 but has been gradually reduced to only 822 billion Japans ownership reached 13 trillion at the end of 2021 but has since been reduced to 11 trillion Their shares of ownership of Treasury bonds declined to 32 and 44 respectivelyThere are more than 40 other foreign countries that own Treasury bonds as well and collectively their holdings have also declined recently From a peak of owning 283 of US Treasury debt in 2014 the other foreign countries holdings declined to 224 in 2023The final group of US Treasury bond holders are other US Financial Institutions This category includes banks pension funds insurance companies mutual funds and hedge funds As a whole the Financial Institutions are more price sensitive than the Fed and the other foreign governments As yields have risen the Financial Institutions are the only ones who have increased their holdings Their share of Treasury ownership rose from 328 in 2014 to 501 in 2023Treasury debt is issued to help fund the US Government The government runs a fiscal deficit each year and their expenditures in excess of revenues are financed by Treasury bonds Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 the governments deficits have been quite large and consequently the Treasurys requirement for debt issuance has been massiveFor the Fiscal Year ending 93023 the government recorded a deficit of 17 trillion a 300 billion increase from FYE 22s deficit of 14 trillion This represents the fourth consecutive year of trillion plus deficits The projection for the current year is more of the sameBecause of the Debt Ceiling crisis this past spring the Treasury had to resort to extraordinary measures to prevent the government from defaulting on its obligations The Treasury had reached its statutory debt limit of 314 trillion in January and could no longer issue new bonds Treasury Secretary Yellen had to move money around and delay funding some retirement programs until Congress solved the problem in June by suspending the debt ceiling until January 1 2025Once Yellen received the authority to turn the debt spigots back on the Treasury has been playing catch up with record new levels of debt In only four months the Treasury has issued 175 trillion in new bonds This amount is larger than issuance in any full year excluding the 2020 pandemic surge Total government debt outstanding has grown to 332 trillion and countingThe basic economic law of Supply and Demand says that when supply increases and demand declines prices must fall In bond land this means that interest rates must go upThis has been evident in looking at the yield on the 10year US Treasury note The Fed began paring back their purchases of Treasuries in December 2021 as they started moving away from QE Then in early 2022 they began cutting their Treasury holdings as they implemented QTWhen the Fed began tapering their QE purchases the 10year Treasury note was yielding roughly 150 As demand for Treasuries has declined and the supply of Treasuries has increased the 10year yield has climbed to 465 the highest level in 16 yearsBecause their borrowing requirements are so immense the Treasury has a sophisticated and robust system for fulfilling their needs under the Office of Debt ManagementThe strategy is to offer a variety of debt instruments through a regular and predictable issuance mechanism This includes promoting a broad and diverse investor base and supporting market liquidity and efficient market functioningTo accomplish their goals the Treasury works with a network of Primary Dealers to ensure that there will always be a market for their needsCurrently there are 25 Primary Dealers who are authorized by the Federal Reserve System to deal directly in government bonds These are banks or brokerdealers who must meet rigid requirements to qualifyThe first requirement is demonstrating sufficient capital A broker dealer not affiliated with a bank must have capital exceeding 50 million For a bank that wants to act as a Primary Dealer they must have at least 1 billion in Tier 1 capital They must also be registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory AuthorityThe next requirement is that the Primary Dealer must demonstrate that they maintain at least a 025 market share in trading government bonds This includes showing a substantial presence as a market maker that provides twoway liquidity in US government securitiesAdditionally they must commit to bid on a consistent basis for their pro rata share at Treasury auctions Their bids must be competitive with prevailing market levelsFinally they must have the proper backoffice support with membership in US clearing organizations to efficiently process transactionsThe Treasury offers several types of debt instruments These include Treasury Bills maturities under 1 year Treasury Notes maturities 110 years Treasury Bonds maturities greater than 10 years Treasury Inflation Protected Securities TIPS and Floating Rate Notes FRNThere is a regular calendar where Treasury Bills are auctioned weekly and all of the other instruments are auctioned monthlyThe mechanism for the auctions is that the Treasury posts a schedule of type of security the size to be issued and the date it is to be auctionedWhen an issue is announced it then trades on a whenissued basis Whenissued trading allows market participants to buy and sell a particular security before it has been auctioned This feature is important because it provides helpful information about the market interest in the upcoming securityOn the day of the auction the Primary Dealers gauge the interest in the security with their customers Customers can bid on a competitive or noncompetitive basis A noncompetitive bid is usually from small investors who say they want the security and will take it at the prevailing market price Competitive bids are for customers who say they will buy the bonds at a specific level They then wait for the auction results to see if they are able to acquire the security at their desired levelThe Primary Dealers then convey the interest of their customers to the Treasury at the prescribed auction timeOnce the auction closes the Treasury compiles all of the bids and accepts bids starting at the lowest yield until they have reached sufficient demand for the amount of security they are offering The highest yielding bid that clears the auction causes the auction to endThe Treasury uses a singleprice format so all winners of the auction pay the same price which is the highest yield accepted to clear the auction even if their bid was at a lower yieldOnce the auction is complete the Treasury then reports the auction resultsThe official results contain a lot of tidbits of information that are helpful in measuring the success of the auctionThe first significant piece of information is to compare the high yield to what the security was trading at on a when issued basis immediately before the auction closed If the high yield is below the whenissued price this is viewed as a strong auction because it demonstrates investors were being aggressive in their bid to ensure that they will get the securities that they desireIf the high yield is above the when issued price this is called a tail A tail is viewed as a weak auction because investors were bidding at a higher yield than that prevailing at auction close and thus are indicating less interest in the security The larger the tail the weaker the auctionThe next piece of information to look at is the bidtocover ratio This indicator measures how much demand there is for the security The larger the bidtocover the greater the interest there is in the securityThe final measure to analyze is the percentage taken down by dealers Primary Dealers are required to submit bids to each auction They want to provide bids for their customers whether on a competitive or noncompetitive basis However if they do not have customer interest then they must submit bids for themselves as marketmakers Again this is part of their role as a Primary DealerHowever they typically do not want to own the security themselves A large percentage taken down by dealers usually means weak customer interest and is viewed as a bad signal while low dealer ownership is viewed as a strong auctionLast week the Treasury issued 3year Treasury Notes 10year Treasury Notes and 30Year Treasury Bonds and the results were all viewed as sloppyThe Treasury started with auctioning 46 billion of 3year notes The high yield was 474 up from 466 last month and the highest level since February 2007The high yield was above the 4723 whenissued yield at auction creating a 17 bp tail This was the largest tail since February and the third largest in the past ten yearsThe bidtocover was 2562 down from last months 275 It was the lowest cover since February and below the sixmonth average of 2792Dealers were awarded 221 of the total the highest level since October 2022Next came the 10year Treasury auction of 35 billionThe high yield was 461 versus 4289 at last months auction The 4592 whenissued yield at auction created a 18 bp tail This was the largest tail since the April auction and the 8 consecutive auction with a tailThe bidtocover was 250 down from last months 252 It was also the lowest bidtocover since JuneDealers took down 209 of the auction the highest level since October 2022The final auction of the week was the 20 billion of 30year Treasury BondsThe high yield was 4837 up from last months 4345 This was the highest yield since August 2007The 30 year whenissued yield was 480 meaning there was a 37bp tail This was the 4 consecutive 30year auction with a tail and it was the largest tail since November 2021 Also it was the 3 largest tail on recordThe bidtocover was 2349 the lowest since February It also was below the 6month average of 244Dealers took down 182 of the auction which was the largest amount since December 2021 It also was above the 6month average dealer takedown of 11Together these auction results show the limited demand within the investor community and how the Primary Dealers were forced to own more of the auctions than they would likeAll indicators point to higher yields aheadThe final Technical factor to analyze is liquidityThe Treasury market has always been the largest and most liquid segment of the bond market Large quantities of securities are traded daily Size trades typically have little impact on the bidask spread This is known as market depthRecent activity however has shown a troubling weakness in market depth As measured by the Bloomberg US Government Liquidity Index seen below liquidity is near its alltime worst level This index measures on average how far yields are away from where fair value models suggest they should be The index has deteriorated over the past year as Treasury yields have risen and is near the alltime high levelThe Fundamentals continue to show above target inflation and the resiliency of the economy as measured by employment cause the Fed to emphasize their higher for longer mantraThe Technicals as demonstrated by declining demand for Treasury debt in an environment of heavy supply due to rising budget deficits suggest higher yields aheadThe metrics of recent Treasury auctions support the weakness in demand among investors and the deterioration in liquidity as rates rise suggest there is more pain to be felt investing in bondsFor those who view the high current yields as an attractive buying opportunity I offer the words of Rick Reider CIO of Global Fixed Income at BlackRockBuy the dip doesnt work during QT  you just keep

192,ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Cash Drain Could Become A Problem (Rating Downgrade),The market has been kind to shipping company  this year as its stock price has plunged from a 52 week high of 2938 all the way down to 917 as of yesterdays closeThe shipping company lowered its expectations for 2023 adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter implying a steep decline in free cash flow as well The market now models a long earnings contraction for the shipping company which means that the dividend might not return for yearsFurthermore growing container supply might result in a depression of freight rates for a longer period of time which in turn might lead to an ongoing rerating of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services valuation multipleI am now a lot more pessimistic as to how long the earnings contraction will last and take responsibility byI have been a big fan of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services when it made a strong value proposition to stockholders in no small part because of the companys huge dividend payout Recently however net losses have forced the shipping company to not pay a dividend and with the market now expecting a long earnings contraction investors will likely have to wait years until the dividend comes backFurthermore the company is burning through cash and might again have to lower its EBITDA guidance when it releases quarterly earnings for the last quarterAccording to ZIM Integrated Shipping Services dividend policy the company distributes 3050 of annual net income as a dividend to shareholders but the recent accumulation of losses has resulted in nonpayment of a dividend and it could take years until the dividend gets paid againBy now the consensus pretty much is that investors will not get a dividend until the free cash flow and earnings situation at the shipping company improves drastically something which might not happen for yearsZIM Integrated Shipping Services lost 213 million in the second quarter which brought total YTD losses to 271 millionI am starting now to be a bit more concerned about the companys cash levels which are rapidly depleting and which in the past at least have been cited including by me as a source of strength for the shipping companyZIM Integrated Shipping Services reported a net debt position of 16 billion in the second quarter and a net leverage ratio of 05x However at the end of last year the company had a 269 million net cash position 00x net leverage ratio The problem with this change in debt is that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services free cash flow has fallen off the cliffPositive free cash flow is naturally replenishing a companys bank accounts and with free cash flow declining a scary 80 YoY in 2Q23 I think ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is at the brink of having potentially to drastically increase its debtThe absence of any real debt and strong free cash flow were good reasons to buy ZIM during the expansion but the cash situation is unlikely to get better in the near termThe company had 33 billion in cash at the end of 2022 and at the end of the second quarter had 19 billion in cash reflecting a decline of 14 billionWith the current rate of cash drain ZIM Integrated Shipping Services might actually have to raise some money next year or leverage up its balance sheetFreight rates have come under considerable pressure in 2022 and 2023 primarily because of shrinking demand in the consumer sector With consumer sentiment deteriorating and shipping volumes shrinking the spot market has come under increasing pressureZIM Integrated Shipping Services average freight rate for instance plunged to just 1193 TEU in the second quarter marking a sharp correction of 67 YoYUnfortunately I dont think the situation is getting much better and I was probably misguided in my earlier assessment that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services could see a shortlived recession and enjoy a quick rebound in freight ratesOne aspect why I am less optimistic on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is that the market continues to expect a glut of new supply for container ships which in my view will continue to suppress average freight rates way into 2024The following chart is reproduced from my last article for convenienceZIM Integrated Shipping Services expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA of 12 billion to 16 billion down from a prior guidance of between 18 billion and 22 billion in Adjusted EBITDA Given the poor state of the shipping industry I would not be surprised to see yet another reduction in the profit outlookThe market now models a much deeper recession than it did in July which is when I presented my last outlook on the shipping company The estimates also indicate that the recession will last longer and concerns over the general state of the economy should be taken seriouslyCyclicallyvulnerable shipping companies are at risk of a major earnings contraction and the market now sees 2024 to lead to even higher losses than are expected for 2023 and the situation is not anticipated to get much better in 2025 eitherProfit estimates are negative and an earnings multiple cant be applied The valuation ultimately depends on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services outlook for 2023 its cash drain in the third quarter and the companys prospects for a free cash flow recoveryIf the outlook gets slashed again when the company presents for 3Q23 I would say the valuation of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is most likely headed for new lows The most important metric to watch moving forward will be ZIM Integrated Shipping Services cash balanceZIM Integrated Shipping Services was a popular income stock in 2021 and 2022 which is when the shipping company returned a boatload of cash to shareholdersBut two consecutive quarters of growing net losses have changed the picture quite a bit and the market now appears to model a steep recession that could last 13 yearsI am now much more concerned about ZIM Integrated Shipping Services cash drain as well as the length of the earnings contraction As a consequence investors must expect to see a much more leverage balance sheet moving forward I am not willing to accept this

193,My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,"Through September the economy remains solid but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead Currently with the funds rate at 55 and the core CPI at 41 the real funds rate is 14 ThatThe Fed can resume its finetuning operation later if the need arises but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go Ill agree that the bulk of the Feds work is done BUT I dont believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a lastminute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded The firstever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mixraising the odds of a government shutdown in midNovember While this situation wont affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that willThe political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics fiscal spending and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors rating agencies and voters Now to be fair the governments deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yieldsthe markets way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order And the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the governments outofcontrol spending the worse the situation will getIn an era of low inflation and zerolow interest rates Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10year Treasury yield now hovering around 49 With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road fiscal austerity would become a nearterm headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates However that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2 target so this growthinflationinterest rate issue isnt going to be so easy to solve However as I will explain later an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced beforeThe auto workers union is making in my opinion some outrageous demands They are asking for a 40 increase in wages over 4 years a 20 reduction in the workweek from 400 to 320 hours and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of allelectric vehicles The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands poisoned any goodfaith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainableAt the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rankandfile union members The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President Against this background it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly As it progresses the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparentWhile investors seem to be pricing a soft landing history is not on their side The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history and the market is still trying to absorb the impact This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by nearterm macro events As rates have spiked so too have longterm yieldsYield spreads also bear monitoring The spread or difference between 2year and 10year Treasury yields has been negative all year ie an inverted yield curve but has narrowed from a record 110 basispoint inversion in March to only 30 basis points todaynot positive but its progress Dating back to 1990 when an inverted yield curve has gone positive it can spell trouble for equities It is not until the curve goes positive by about 125 basis points do equities form a bottom and a rally ensues I suspect we are a very long way from a yield curve that will be that positiveThe past two weeks investors were reminded that they are operating in a world full of turmoil We spoke about the terrorist attack in Israel last week and as Ill speak to later markets tend to eventually calm and overlook these situations The MACRO scene however has been impacted especially  No doubt the  to Israel in what is their 911 event Add that to the ongoing Ukraine situation and the spendingdebt debacle in our economy the rubber band gets stretched once again The US has pledged to Ukraine and now the administration plans to ask Congress for an  Israel that they will get what they need to defend themselves but I am citing the facts and reality of the situation These events along with the continuing overhang of the ChinaTaiwan situation come at a time when the US finds itself in the weakest fiscal situation since WWII In the meantime taxpayers continue to hear the same rhetoric regarding spending as Treasury Secretary Yellen announced  Perhaps that might be true if they were the only issues that require boatloads of money to process However they are notThere is a contingent in which Ms Yellen is a firm supporter that wishes to spend trillions on climate issues and an energy transition While the economy is doing well welfare spending is near or at alltime highs In fiscal year  the federal  spent 119 trillion on more than 80 different  programs That represents almost 20 of total federal spending and a quarter of tax revenues in 2022 That is for WELFARE in a supposedly economy that is humming along The pandemic is over but the countrys food stamp program reached an alltime high in November 2022 and remains at that levelThen there are the 67 million immigrants that have arrived and they also come with a huge cost to social services welfare etc Finally the cherry on top of this debt cake The cost of  the existing debt not future debt will be about the same as the existing Social Security program In effect we are soon going to be spending on TWO Social Security programsTherefore it is a HUGE stretch to assume the US can afford the two wars and will ever be able to enter a period of fiscal responsibility that is so desperately neededIt doesnt take a Wharton School graduate to realize that other spending must be curtailed I realize I keep repeating that but it is the lynchpin in this MACRO scene that will have the most impact At some point this notion that the climate is the BIGGEST threat to our economy has to be scrapped If it isnt then you can kiss global economic growth goodbye Given all of the other existential threats that are REAL some will slowly come to realize what the common sense crowd has said from day ONE The climate ISNT the biggest threat to our economy The only question that remains is  is it already too lateBetween the issues at home and with events and threats presenting themselves on multiple fronts abroad the geopolitical situation is as fragile as it has been in decades For the US the latter is a selfinflicted policy error that leaves the  That in turn will negatively impact the financial markets for what could turn out to be a period The 3Q23 earnings season ramped up this week with 11 of the

the indices staged a complete reversal to wipe out the earlyday losses to close flat for the day The Russell 2000 bucked the selling trend all day and posted a 1 rallySelling pressure was stepped up

volatile trading session The indication that the FOMC could be sidelined by the rise in longerterm interest rates that are doing some of the Feds heavy lifting was taken by the markets as a dovish stance and yields and the US Dollar tumbled while Wall Street ralliedHowever the markets shuddered at Powels view that the economys resilience could be because rates have not been high enough for long enough suggesting a restrictive stance for a lot longer until the economy slows sufficiently to bring inflation to 2That is a message I sent a couple of months ago when we started to see the forecasts for a solid GDP forecast for Q3   Its HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut  then that means the economy is falling off a cliff That is also frightening for equitiesHouse Speaker Vote It now appears there is no obvious path to 217 votes for Jordan leaving some Republicans to wonder if they could elect current temporary Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry RNC Its unclear if he can garner 217 votes eitherThe continuing resolution keeping the government open expires on 1117 and besides the geopolitical turmoil around the world that needs to be addressed the longer the House goes without reaching an agreement on who to elect as speaker the more likely it is that we reach that midNovember deadline without a budget agreementThen there is the administrations emergency request to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine and Israel With the slim Republican majority they would need 98 of their contingent to back ONE candidate and as we have seen that is an impossible task An easy solution would be for the President to solve the issue by persuading a literal handful of Democrats to get behind a candidate ALL have unanimously voted against any Republican nominee and remove this obstacleAs far as the shutdown as stated in earlier updates its a nonevent for the markets If the aid packages are deemed that important then the roadblock can be easily eliminated to approve the spending With complete dysfunction in Washington were all suffering the consequences of politiciansAfter three years of overlapping crises it is natural to wonder whether the surprise attack on Israel and its subsequent declaration of war poses another threat to the global economy and supply chains around the world While these concerns are valid I do not think the tensions in the Middle East will lead to any  Unlike Russia and Ukraine Because of this it is unlikely that the IsraeliHamas war will disrupt supply chains or drag down economic confidence in the same way the RussiaUkraine war or the pandemic did over the last few years A major impact on supply chains could occur if there was an escalation in the war throughout the regionFortunately I think we have to view that as a LOW probability of occurrence The only way the oil supply could be disrupted is if Iran were to enter the war Iran has long been a financial backer of terrorist groups like Hamas as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon but that is very different from engaging in a direct military confrontation with Israel As the leadership in Tehran knows very well Israel is a nucleararmed country and has the strongest air force in the Middle East It would be downright suicidal for Iran to get involved However for a variety of other reasons I do believe that the added uncertainty will hold oil prices near the 8590barrel range that are taking place in the Israeli conflict but the war has not altered my asset class views or outlook for the US economy or earnings growth First from an economic perspective Israel is a small country with a GDP of 521 billionmaking it the 29th largest country in the world representing only 05 of world GDP To put this into perspective when measured by GDP Israel would rank as the 13th largest state in the US roughly the size of Virginia and when compared to companies in the SP 500 Israel is roughly the same size as the 15th largest company Eli LillyAdditionally Israel is not a significant trade partner of the US making up only 07 of both US imports and exports the 25th and 29th largest trade partner respectively And because of this Israel is not big enough to derail the US economy from its current path From an earnings perspective given that I dont expect a significant economic impact from the war combined with the fact that the SP 500 receives only 02 and 28 of revenues from Israel and the Middle East region respectively the conflict will not have a meaningful impact on earningsFinally it is worth noting that previous events in the region have not had a significant market impact Unfortunately conflict in this region is nothing new Bespoke Investment Group notes that in the previous 11 major conflicts the SP 500 was up 15 on average in the 12 months following the onset of the conflict and was positive 75 of the timeWhile this terrorist act may not change my economic views it does highlight what is yet another global policy error that can have major MACRO consequences in the futureIran did some saberrattling this week by  The fact that Iran is in a position to make any calls in this war is preposterous The lack of global leadership in dealing with Iran is why there is a second global war being waged today Shockingly the US continues to be the leading player in shirking responsibility by sending billions to what the  as a state sponsor of terrorIf this terrorist attack isnt a wakeup call to impose economic sanctions that will  the Iranian economy once and for all then we can expect more of the same in the future The FACTS not opinion rhetoric or spin but FACTS tell us the existing sanctions on Iran are NOT being enforced Iranian oil exports have tripled in the last 2 years Instead of crippling their economy the countrys coffers have been enriched in the last 2 yearsIf common sense doesnt prevail this war is just the beginning of global turmoil The US received yet another reminder that policy errors have consequences when a  headed for Israel After missing the opportunity to buy oil at a cheaper price the US finally decided to begin  Strategic Petroleum Reserve Energy Secretary Granholm has stated it may take up to two years to bring the reserve back up to prior levels Combine this with US Domestic issues that Ill present next and its easy to see why the price of crude oil will stay elevated and perhaps ratchet higherThere is  reason to abandon the energy tradeExxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods announced that he struck a 595 billion deal to buy oil and gas explorer This deal can be read as a bet on US shale fracking and a sidestep against the US antifossil fuels policies The acquisition comes at a time when the present hostile regulatory environment makes it more difficult to explore and develop new resourcesThis deal accomplishes quite a lot for Exxon  as the company becomes the biggest player in the rich  that spans Texas and New Mexico In addition the rising rate environment is making it more expensive to drill and that should encourage more M A activityBeing a lowcost producer with an enviable list of land assets Pioneer Natural Resources is a prize Exxon will now have the luxury of bypassing the arduous and at times impossible task of acquiring new leases and permits That means the newly combined entity will drill longer more productive horizontal wells without wasting more time and money Exxon has already stated that it can drill longer laterals Which means fewer wells which reduces the environmental impactA the end of the day Exxon expects to double its current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day which is more than half of its current worldwide production In a stroke of genius Exxon is making a huge bet on US shale while defraying costs and in effect has outgamed the system that is at war with fossil fuels In essence this buyout of Pioneer makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing longterm supply and demandUS oil output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells However that is about to end as the number of those wells has dropped to 830 from 3330 in the Permian in the last 2 years The Administration continues to slowwalk new drilling permits and leases which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisitionThe Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated fiveyear offshore leasing plan more than a year late It included a mere three auctions through 2029the least necessary to comply with the IRA Since 1992 no fiveyear plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales That action sends large oil companies to move their operations The world will need fossil fuels for many decades and at some point the energy transition fraught with all of its issues will be   The costs associated with the transition run into the trillions and the money that has already been buried in this project has not produced anywhere near the solution that is required to run a productive economyFinally US workers and the US economy would be better off if production happened at home rather than overseas The US energy policy that I have warned about for the past two years is starting to show that policies have consequencesThe indices are all at a point where they could still go either way Given all of the outside influences the best scenario might be more sideways action Plenty of starts and stops with uncertainty sure seems like it will be part of the scene for a while Perhaps for the entire 4th quarter That tells me to stay diversified and look for special situationsIts easy to see why I use technical analysis as part of my strategy The SP 500 rallied to a resistance trend line and was turned away The battle will now be waged at what is considered to be an important support area for the indexThe ball is in the BULLs court and it will soon be time for them to step up and defend their position A break of support opens up a completely different set of circumstances on the technical frontOnce sentiment sours NOTHING is going to change that

194,SQM: The Future Of Lithium Amidst The Energy Transition,Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile SA  is priced at 5x this years EPS Anyone looking at this stock will immediately recognize that its cheaply valued So this consideration is not the main factor thats weighing onThe problem with this stock is that theres so much uncertainty priced in Undoubtedly some aspects are worthy elements that  priced inDemand for lithium is going to massively increase in the next few years Accordingly the longterm thesis is clearly intact However a combination of riskoff investor sentiment together with a slowdown in the energy transition is overwhelmingly impacting the stockHere I shine a light on why investors are eschewing this stock Ultimately even though there are some aspects that should be factored in I believe that at 5x this yearsWhats the energy transition Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it was clear Is the energy transition when we stopped using wood and dung and started to use coal as the primary energy source Or is the energy transition when we started to use Diesel oil for mobility Or perhaps the energy transition was when we started to increase our usage of natural gas for electricity generation heating and cookingPerhaps the energy transition is in the future when we use a greater proportion of our primary energy supply from solar panels and wind turbines Do you see the point Im making here That we are always transiting from one source of energy to anotherEveryone talks about the energy transition as if it happens overnight But the fact of the matter is that while we have energy transitions they take time And what do investors absolutely hate nearly as much as bad news UncertaintyNot knowing how long well have to wait to get paid And I get it With the share price going up nobody is going to bother with difficult questionsBut when the share price starts to move south everything that was an uncertainty before becomes bad news NowInvestors time horizons shorten and unless something is expected to go up within the next 12 months with a high degree of certainty investors lose patienceIm not saying that SQM is unquestionably a good investment I for one invested with Albemarle  disclosure Im long ALB Admittedly both companies have been terrible performers in 2023Theres no clearer sign of investors capitulation than the right side of the chart consistently moving down day after day without respiteThe top concern is the most obvious and can even be discerned in the companys name Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile When investors are riskseeking investing in Chile is a compelling opportunity Its a fastgrowing company thats strategically located in Chile which grants it access to abundant lithium resources and costeffective mining operationsBut when interest rates are high plus investors temperaments mercurial all that investors can think about are the political and regulatory risks that arise due to the companys operations in Chile not to mention the likely overreaching government policies that may capture some of the companys profits80 of SQMs gross profits are tied to lithiums prospects If lithium regains its footing SQM will do well And in time lithiums prospects will improveLithium prices have fallen by around 70 in the past year This has for the most part been brought about by the sustainable climb in prices in the previous 2 yearsAgain the overall energy transition story is still very much intact Demand for lithium is expected to increase in the future primarily driven by the growing adoption of EVs and the expansion of renewable energy storage systemsAs automakers worldwide increasingly shift towards EV production to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements lithiumion batteries will play a pivotal role in powering these vehiclesAdditionally the renewable energy sectors need for energy storage solutions to stabilize  will further boost lithium demand making it a crucial element in the energy transitionMoreover lithium demand for energy storage solutions aimed at grid stabilization is on the rise as utilities and the grid seek reliable methods to store excess energy and balance supply and demand especially given the increasing amount of integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar into the gridI contend that lithium batteries have gained prominence in this role due to their efficiency rapid response times and ability to store and discharge electricity when needed contributing to grid stabilityI have a cautiously optimistic outlook on SQM While its trading at an attractive 5 times this years EPS there are notable nearterm uncertainties and doubts that need considerationThe demand for lithium while poised for substantial growth in the long run due to the shift towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage has faced recent setbacks leading to a substantial drop in lithium prices and creating shortterm volatilityAdditionally SQMs exposure to political and regulatory risks in Chile coupled with market uncertainties may dampen investor sentiment in the short termHowever the fundamental strength of SQMs lithium production and its strategic position in the industry suggest a potentially brighter future once these nearterm challenges are navigatedMy Marketplace highlights a portfolio of

195,The West Is Losing Control Over The Gold Price,An important change has unfolded in the global gold market The East has been driving up the gold price predominantly in late 2022 and the first months of 2023 breaking the Wests longstanding pricing powerUntil recently Western institutional money was driving the  in wholesale markets such as London mainly based on real interest rates Gold was bought when real rates fell and vice versa However from late 2022 until June 2023 gold was up 17 while real rates were more or less flat and Western institutions were net  Most likely Eastern central banks and Turkish and Chinese private demand lifted the price of goldFor about ninety years up until 2022 there was a patternIf we zoom in on the period from 2006 through 2021 the main reason for Western institutions to buy or sell gold was the  which reflects the 10year expected real interest rate real rate in short of US government bondsThe physical gold price was predominantly set in the London Bullion Market and to a lesser extent Switzerland Gold trade in London can be divided in three categoriesAs we will see below the TIPS rate UK net gold import positive or negative Western ETF holdings and the COMEX open interest were all correlated to the price of gold Until the war in Ukraine broke out late February 2022 that is and things started to changeBecause customs data lags a few months and the World Gold Councils supply and demand data is published quarterly we will cover the global market until June 2023 in this article We will examine how gold is becoming less sensitive to real rates and how London is losing its gold pricing powerLets start by  the correlation between real rates and gold Note the TIPS yield axes in the charts below are inverted because higher rates caused lower gold prices and vice versaFrom March until September 2022 the TIPS yield rose dramatically down in the chart but the price of gold reacted less bearish than the rates model previously prescribed As London was still a net exporter over this time horizon I conclude the West was still in charge of the price But then came the third quarter of 2022From late October 2022 until June 2023 the TIPS rate was barely down while gold was up 17 Remarkably the West wasnt driving up the gold price as demonstrated by UK net exports declining Western ETF inventory and falling COMEX open interestFirst the UKs monthly net flows Obviously the price wasnt set in London as the UK was a net seller while the price was up In Chart 1 and 4 you can see this is unprecedentedAlso taking into account gold flows through Switzerland the secondlargest Western  and largest refining hub globally shows a similar picture For the first time since monthly data is available the gold price has been rising over several months while the UK and Switzerland combined are net exportersNot surprisingly Western ETF inventory of which the majority is stored in London and Switzerland has declined over the past three quartersWestern institutions that trade gold outright or use ETFs are dominant on the COMEX futures exchange as well At the COMEX we see the same development golds open interest has fallen over the period in questionIf the UK and Switzerland were net exporters who did they sell to The UK mainly exported gold to Switzerland so to answer this question all we have to do is find out which countries Switzerland exported to and check if these countries didnt sell the metal onThe Swiss customs department lets users track the flow of goods per continent Apparently Switzerland was a huge net exporter to Asia when the gold price went upLets see which of Switzerlands main buyers in Asia could have pushed up the gold priceIt wasnt India as the Indians like most people in the East are price sensitive From October through June Indias net gold imports declined with the exception of June when the price revertedPossibly Chinese private demand somewhat lifted the gold price Although the Chinese are usually price sensitive net imports into the mainland were surprisingly strong in November and December 2022 and in February and March 2023Turkeys net import reached an alltime high in January 2023 when the Turkish lira continued to devalue and the Turks fled to real estate durable goods and needless to say gold After January the Turkish central bank began blocking imports and sold 156 tonnes of its official gold reserves domestically to defend the lira No doubt that Turkish private demand mainly up until January has had an impact on the gold priceA proper indicator of a trend reversal is the net flows to Eastern trading hub Hong Kong Normally Hong Kong would be a net importer when the price declines and vice versa Recently however Hong Kong was a net importer while the price was up Possibly central banks are buying in Hong Kong monetize the gold locally and repatriate the metal outside the scope of public customs data Gold owned by central banks monetary gold  is exempt from being reported in customs dataThe tonnages recently net imported by Hong Kong may not be very impressive but they could be a sign of a larger development If central banks are buying in Hong Kong they can be buying anywhereMajor suspects are nonWestern central banks secretly buying gold as dollar assets have become riskier to hold since the US seized Russias official dollar reserves in 2022 These central banks have an incentive not to make public rushing into gold or the price would spike excessively giving them less bang for their buckEvery quarter the World Gold Council WGC publishes an estimate based on field research by Metals Focus that reflects how much they think central banks have bought Since the Ukraine war these quarterly estimates are much higher than what central banks in aggregate report to the IMF Most likely covert central bank purchases have boosted the priceThe most logical explanation for golds recent behavior is a combination of surreptitious buying by central banks from emerging markets and strong private demand in Turkey and China Its possible the WGCs estimates of covert central bank buying are too low given these estimates were falling during the price spike at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023As some of you might have noticed the US dollar gold price has been declining in the last months of the period of our investigation and London was still a net exporter Perhaps the West will regain control over the price again I dont expect the gold price to fall to levels previously suggested by the rates model thoughCentral bank buying is likely to stay strong We still believe that the official sector will remain a sizeable bullion buyer for the foreseeable future   as factors that encouraged reserve managers to add gold reserves in recent years are expected to persist  this AugustWe will have to wait and see if the East is able to further push up the price of gold and weaken the Wests control over the price If so gold will become less of a dollar derivative and take more center stage in the international monetary system The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,113,2023-08-26,0
196,Public Storage: A Simple Question Of Supply And Demand,Over the long haul it could be said that betting on the American selfstorage space has really been a bet on the American consumer as people buy more stuff to put in their homes eventually theyll run out ofA primary beneficiary of this stunning growth is Public Storage  the largest selfstorage player in the United States which as of its  boasted 206 million net rentable square feet of storage space spread across 2888 facilities and whose common stock sports a 44 dividend yield as of this writingThe largescale trends across the country haveFor all of these bullish points however the market seems to believe that the outlook for Public Storage is not quite so rosy as evidenced by the stocks 185 decline over the last 12 monthsOver the last ten years in fact the stock has appreciated 77 versus the broader SP 500s  return of 171 Reviewing the stocks performance on a total return basis for the same time frame also reveals underperformance for Public Storage with a 158 return against SPYs 225While it might be tempting to view the drop in Public Storages price as a potential buying opportunity we do not believe that the outlook for the company or the sector to be quite as strong as what the bulls contend In fact we think that a few key drivers will precipitate a continued slowdown in Public Storages business and underperformance in its stock The main points of our argument are thusLets dive inOn the  Public Storage management highlighted move in volume with CEO Joseph Russell noting that we are driving record yearoveryear growth in customer movein volumes Movein volume growth has accelerated throughout the year up nearly 14 in the second quarterWhile growing volumes of moveins might generate excitement on a conference call analysts had questions about the companys moveouts as well Lets take a dive into the same store net tenant addition metrics for Public Storages latest quarterOf Public Storages 2888 properties 2344 roughly 81 are considered same store with the remainder in development or having been acquired less than one year ago In our view this reflects an aggressive growth strategy on behalf of the company more on that later Public Storage posted this chart in its latest quarterly filing detailing same store data Note that realized rent per occupied square foot grew overall by 83 average occupancy across all markets declined overall by 21 This indicates that the increase in revenue in the latest reporting period was drivenat least in the same store categoryby price hikes to existing customers rather than an increase in new tenantsThe picture doesnt get better when analyzing the tenants coming in to replace those that are leavingAs can be seen in the chart above  of the most recent 10Q new tenants average annual contract rent per square foot decreased year over year by 144 while promotional discounts to new tenants increased by 264 Additionally the net delta between new contract rents gained year over year versus contract rents lost from moveouts widened significantly from negative 6 million in the quarter ending June 2022 to negative 292 million for the comparable quarter in 2023In other words it appears that Public Storage is having difficulty bringing in new tenants at full price while it continues to raise rates for existing tenants and also experiencing a net decrease in overall tenants as expressed by average occupancyIt is perhaps not surprising that Public Storage is having difficulty with net tenant additions given that the industry has been building new facilities at a feverish pace to meet demand over the last decadeIn any industry rapid buildouts of supply are driven by demand but supply takes time to come online and demand can wane during that time frame causing supply to overshoot To frame the situation for the selfstorage industry an estimated  of new storage facility space is expected to be completed in 2023 while the average storage unit price has dropped according to SpareFootcom with the estimated cost to rent a storage unit in 2023 being 100 per month compared to Its also a murky proposition to assume that Americans who are not yet utilizing storage spaces will suddenly jump on board and become new tenants Consider our chart belowPictured above is a monthly snapshot of the Public Storage stock price and the Google trend search term SelfStorage Near Me going back to September 2010 While not a perfect correlation it can clearly be seen that the spike in searches for selfstorage we should note that Public Storage boasts that a large portion of its new moveins come through its online funnel in 2021 coincided with a rise in Public Storages stock price Searches for storage space has since moderated back towards 2019 levels which in our minds is evidence that Americans are losing steam when it comes to renting new selfstorage unitsAs an aside we also believe that the stickiness of the selfstorage consumer is also somewhat overstated in the bull case While tenants who store motorhomes or other large items will likely remain for the long term research from StorageCafecom shows that most people using storage across the country are  Further most contracts at selfstorage properties are monthtomonth with no penalty for cancelling Public Storages 10K notes on  that its lease policy is monthtomonthIt isnt far fetched to think then that tenants could simply sell discard or move it back into their living space especially if they are looking to cut roughly 100 in expenses out of their monthly budget and there is ample  to support the  that  seeking  monthly expendituresFurthermore the largest driver of new selfstorage rentals comes from tenants moving to a This of course was a boon for the selfstorage industry as remote work became all the rage and highearning white collar workers fled urban  to more rural settings However that trend appears to be  and there is plenty of research showing that Americans are moving While we arent of the belief that mass amounts of tenants will mount an exodus from selfstorage nationwide we believe that the majority of the facts do not stand in Public Storages favorDespite Public Storages acquisitive nature recall that roughly 2025 of its properties are excluded from same store sales analysts have largely factored out future FFO growth expectations from the stockAgainst analyst estimates looking out in the second unreported year of 1750 per share of FFO Public Storage stock currently trades at roughly 156x FFOShare on a forward basisSeeking Alphas  paints a slightly worse picture showing that the stock trades at 16x forward price to FFO which is 309 above the sector meanShould the company see its ability to hike prices on existing renters deteriorate and if net moveins continue to decline as we think both will for the reasons outlined above this will inevitably squeeze margins and Public Storage which could result in further gloom from analysts in the futureFor us then we target a 1520 decline in forward price to FFO valuation as a good point to reevaluate Public Storages situation against the macroeconomic backdropIt is difficult to grow a business with a relatively fixed cost structure while large amounts of new supply are set to come online amidst signs of waning demand This is the situation that we believe Public Storage finds itself in today For the reasons outlined in this article we remain negative on the stock  Disclaimer The information contained herein is opinion and for

197,TORM: The Comeback Is Unfolding,You are reading my 4th article on TORM plc   one of the worlds largest transporters of refined oil products operating in various vessel segments from Medium Range to Long Range 2 tankersI first wrote aboutToday Id like to update my coverage again as the tanker transportation market is changing quite dynamically and the TORM reported its strongest performance ever building on a strong 1st quarter They achieved a TCE of 308 million with an EBITDA result of 237 million with a margin of 616 vs 453 last year After adjusting for unrealized gains EBITDA increased by 23 to 199 million and profit before tax increased by 72 to 184 million compared to Q2 FY2022As the management noted during  TORMs return on invested capital amounted to 339 in Q2 vs 227 last year and its balance sheet remained strong with a net LTV ratio of 29 and available liquidity of 497 million The board of directors approved a dividend of 15 per share based on the second quarter results TORM has taken delivery of several vessels and entered into collaborations to enhance their fleets performance They mentioned The executives emphasize the importance of the product tanker order book which is currently at 10 of the fleet Its spread across 35 years of deliveries translating to a relatively low annualized growth rate any new orders wont be delivered before 2026 This implies that the market may not see significant new supply in the near term supporting current ratesSo the financial outlook for the remainder of FY2023 was bullish so to speak as TORM expects significant earnings day coverage at favorable rates As of August 14 2023 the company had already secured 72 of its fullyear earning days and 74 of its Q3 earning days While these rates provide a foundation TORM acknowledges the potential for market rates to vary significantly given the low visibility of unfixed TCE rates Their outlook for FY2023 anticipates TCE in the range of 10501175

199,Rising U.S. Treasury Yields Do Some Of The Fed's Heavy Lifting,I love it when I can figure out a way to work more efficiently or even better get someone to do my work for me The less I have to do the better I think the US Federal Reserve Fed agrees After all when it comes toWhen someone is happy to do your work for you I think thats a good thing Ive mentioned before how my oldest son used to prefer cleaning with his grandmother to playing with toys when he was a toddler My husband was uncomfortable with this but IIt seems the Fed has found a helper of sorts as well in the rising 10year yield and one thats a bit more effective than a threeyearold armed with Windex and paper towels Different Fed members have said as much in recent days and even Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months and longerterm bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tighteningThere are a variety of reasons for this increase The 10year US Treasury yield is composed of two drivers 1 its influenced by shortterm rates which is fairly straightforward and 2 it factors in a term premium that investors demand for holding onto a bond for that long That term premium reflects everything else that could occur over the life of the bond including growth expectations and inflation expectations Recently inflation expectations have remained relatively stable and so we need to look to other factors to explain the rise in long yieldsOf course there is a countervailing force that can push down yields and has done so on at least a few days since the conflict in the Middle East began a preference for safe haven asset classes There have been concerns that this crisis could be contagious and expand to involve other countries which has fueled a move to Treasuries on several days since the conflict began Although there has been far more of a preference for gold as a safe haven asset class preferences can change  especially since the opportunity cost of owning gold is higher as yields riseThe rising 10year yield is arguably a positive development in that it means the Fed doesnt have to hike rates anymore and therefore hastens the end of the tightening cycle in my opinion In other words its ripping the bandaid off However its also exerting downward pressure on stocks And when I talk to clients outside the US they worry about the impact that higher mortgage rates driven up by the 10year US Treasury yield will have on American consumersBut while the national average 30year US fixed mortgage rate just hit 8 a level that has not been seen in many years I dont think it will have a very significant impact on US households Thats because more than 90 of existing mortgages in the US are longterm fixedrate mortgages  with an average rate below 4  so rising rates will not impact US households the way they have impacted households in other countries that do not have the exorbitant privilege of longterm fixedrate mortgages Or the way they impacted US households in advance of the Global Financial Crisis when nearly 40 of existing mortgages were adjustablerate In fact past due residential real estate loans have declined since mid2020The biggest result of high mortgage rates may be a low inventory of houses for sale since many homeowners are unwilling to put their houses on the market with rates so high The environment has created golden handcuffs for themPolicy uncertainty is likely to create an environment in which the 10year yield will continue to move in a wide range in the near term But I believe once we get clarity from the Fed that the rate hike cycle has ended then I think we will see yields begin to ease In other words I think skyhigh longterm yields are likely to be very temporaryI think we are likely to get policy clarity in the next few months After all I thought it was meaningful that Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time Wage growth is typically the stickiest part of inflation so that suggests the Fed is content with progress made in the labor market  all the more reason they shouldnt need to hike rates againAnd while the Fed may continue to talk tough in the short term and we got a lot of tough talk in Powells speech last week I think it will be quick to recognize signs of the lagged effects of monetary policy on the economy as I believe a very real slowdown a bumpy landing is coming The very datadependent Fed should soon realize there is no need for more rate hikes  and that there will likely be a need for at least one rate cut before the end of the first half of 2024 I believe higher oil prices will also weigh down on the US consumer and do some of the Feds work for itUS stocks are likely to come under pressure in the near term as the 10year yield remains high and perhaps moves slightly higher Last week the SP 500 Index fell more than 2 down to 4224  which marks its lowest level since June 1 But I have to put this all in perspective it is well below its peak of 4796 on January 3 2022 but is well above its closing low of 3577 on October 12 2022 I think it is telling us that the recession that was priced in last year with an approximately 25 drop in the SP 500 is being replaced with a slowdown being forecasted by a milder drop in the SP 500 this yearAt the expense of sounding like a broken record I see this as an environment that reminds us of the importance of broad diversification across and within not just equities and fixed income but alternativesAfter a flurry of data releases last week Im primarily waiting to see what the Federal Open Market

200,Bank Credit Continues To Quietly Tighten: Will The Market Wake Up?,As of my writing this the SP 500  is up 20 for the year even while earnings are down The animal spirits are alive and well Onceskeptical investors are increasingly shipping all their money in and largecap equityIn the US and major economies in Europe quarterly surveys are showing that credit is increasingly hard to come by In the past tightening credit has been a clear indicator of a coming economic downturn This is fairly intuitive because if prices of homes and cars are out of line with wages and credit dries up then theres nowhere for prices to go but down There arent many signs of a crunch for credit cards yet but there too I wonder how much consumers can run up before it starts to bite Credit card  in the USData on lending conditions tends to be reported infrequently and with a lag but a shorthand trick I have for gauging lending conditions is to compare jumbo mortgages with conventional FannieFreddie mortgages The idea here is that prices for jumbo mortgages are set by the market while prices for conventional mortgages are set by the US governments actuaries pricing the risk Here we see that credit likely has continued to steadily tightenHeres what weve got 1 year ago jumbo mortgages were at 457 Conventional mortgages were 513 These numbers come from surveys so theyre approximate but the indicated spread of jumbo mortgages was 56 bps for jumbos Today jumbos are at 710 while conventional mortgages are at 705 Thats a much higher rate and a spread of 5 bps This change really kicked into gear in the past few months On March 1st the spread was still 49 bps Jumbo mortgages are also anecdotally much harder to get The Fed has signaled that theyre going to hike once more so the squeeze is likely just getting started In 2008 jumbos hit 8 when lending dried up and were now only 90 bps away from that same peak Economywide how many people are able to pay 80000 per year in interest for a milliondollar mortgage Not many How many people could pay 30000 per year in interest in 2021 Lots of people could especially if they saw their neighbors and friends doing it This is the business cycle in action Survey after survey is now showing that credit is harder to get and even those who can qualify are thinking twiceSome people are going to go for it anyway and pay any DTI they can get approved for And about 2025 of US buyers pay cash But millions of people arent which is  and mortgage applications in the US are at or below their 2008 recession lows And for those who are buying homes DTI ratios are now at 40 Of course the mainstream media and the banks want you to believe that the 2008 financial crisis was entirely caused by a few rogue lenders who did illegal things and by themselves brought down the economy According to them this is all cleaned up so you have nothing to worry about  however The truth is that millions of middle and uppermiddleclass households overleveraged themselves to keep up with the Joneses Now if you look youll see that mortgage debt is lower than it was in 2008 but the population is also much older Households in their 20s 30s and 40s are doing nearly the exact same thing that their older counterparts were doing in 2006 and 2007 Whether it becomes as big of a problem as 2008 remains to be seen40 average DTIs is wild and the fact that roughly half of the loans being made are above a 40 DTI is even crazier DTI is typically calculated pretax so taking 30 for federalstateFICA taxes or so off of pretax income means that the typical true debttodisposable income ratio is closer to 57 4070 Typically these loans are going to dualincome households so if even one spouse subsequently loses their job the house is going on the market We can then look at past historical data on unemployment and put in a joint probability of either spouse or both losing their job and the numbers are shockingDuring past recessions unemployment typically peaks between 6 and 9 Moreover unemployment tends to be structural meaning workers arent able to get new jobs right away as they are when unemployment is 35 Short of a COVIDmoney printing binge theres not a whole lot the government can do to stop unemployment from rising from time to time At 6 the joint probability of either spouse or both losing their job is 116 At a 9 unemployment rate the joint probability of either or both is 171 Does this mean millions of homebuyers will be forced to sell Not necessarily but it does illustrate how millions of homes were bought in the 2006 bubble only to flood the market in 20082010 When DTIs are lower ie 2530 these conditions dont exist because its much more likely that both spouses would have to lose their jobs to not be able to afford the mortgage  basic groceries  utilities The probability of both spouses losing their jobs at a 6 unemployment rate is only 036 High DTIs at business cycle peaks intuitively lead to future forced sellersSomething else thats very important to know about economic statistics is that construction is counted in GDP when its in progress not when someone buys it This means if theres a lot of new construction that isnt selling GDP will remain strong until construction slows down This hasnt happened yet but its likely to happen in the futureAuto credit is another area where crazy stuff happened during the last business cycle Used cars are not typically a market known for bubbles but a combination of chip shortages FOMO and easily available credit led to a bona fide credit cycle in used carsHere we see  surged 68 from mid2019 to late 2021 Now theyre crashing on the back of higher interest rates and better inventory availability Thats a problem for auto lenders who lent against peak usedcar prices because now their collateral isnt worth much at all Furthermore  means buyers have to pay up if they want to buy a car Securitized  and now it seems some of these cars may end up recycled back into the market A recent Fed survey just found  This is also worth watchingThe last piece of the puzzle here is business credit Here we have an interesting contradiction Banks are quickly tightening business credit butis seeming quite receptive Theres probably only so far junk bonds and bank credit can diverge because theyre substitutes in many casesThe financial markets continue to firmly believe in the idea of a soft landing while bank credit itself tends to be what determines whether the business cycle ebbs or flows Both the supply and demand for business credit are slowing and the situation is not likely to improve with the Fed raising capital requirements for banks and the commercial real estate losses continuing to pressure lendingHave highyield bond traders completely lost their minds The pricing looks a little loose but not necessarily crazyBB junk bond spreads have been about as low or lower many times in the past but never by much and generally not for longAnd here are the spreads for Brated bonds which are a little dicier in the best of times but generally not terrible Just  the defaults on these are likely to run 25 on the BBs and perhaps 48 on the Bs Add back about 40 for recoveries and the losses are likely to run somewhere in the range of 12 to 3 for the BBs and 24 to 48 on the Bs Against credit spreads of 24 and 4 respectively junk bonds appear to be priced for either returns a bit above or a bit below Treasuries What hasnt happened yet that probably will happen at some point is a big correction in spreads that makes highyield bonds actually attractive rather than simply breaking even vs Treasuries or returning a bit moreTheres quite a paradox here On one hand largecap stock valuations are incredibly optimisticas if the business cycle doesnt even exist And on the other bank lending and leading economic indicators are contracting at a similar pace or greater to past recessions Highyield bonds are somewhat in the middle here The pricing isnt awful but its by no means attractiveFor stocks Ive been critical in past years of using the Shiller CAPE ratio or other indicators that adjust earnings for the business cycle due to unfair comparisons from the 2018 corporate tax cuts in the US and interest rates being at zero Interest rates are no longer at zero and the CAPE comps are now based on the lower corporate tax rate Stocks are significantly overvaluedThe economy is out of whack and changes in the supply of credit are likely to force prices back in line with wages and then wages back in line with productivity Getting back to equilibrium almost certainly means a recession This is priced into the yield curve and is reflected in rapidly tightening lending standards across the economy However this is only somewhat reflected in the corporate bond market and not all in the stock market Stocks have traded at lower valuations than now roughly 95 of the time for good reason As much as everyone wants this time to be different from hundreds of years of economic cycles this time is not likely to be different   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or

201,Disney:Why You Should Buy And Hold Forever,Although Fact Set breaks down the revenues into a few different subcategories Disney generally classifies them as DMED for the media side and DPEP for the parks and hotel side The DMED business represented about 35 of total operating income for FY22 and DPEP 65 So in this case we have huge revenues with slim margins on the media business and lower revenues with higher margins on the parksentertainment and retail sideThe equation here for a turnaround looks quite clear enhance the parks business with greater CAPEX and cut the fat on the media side now that a customer base has been established The linear media business also needs to be slowly merged into the Web Based Data and Services portion or streaming No small feat However Netflix has shown us that fairly high operating and profit margins can be achieved in directtoconsumer streaming Replicating it is the ultimate goalDisney was launched on November 12 2019 This combined with park closures during Covid and the departure of Iger resulted in negative profit margins for a short stint The recovery has been slow and not entirely prettyBack to Netflix as a comp for what all streaming services aim to achieve While Netflix has been around longer than 2009 streaming was introduced during this period It took the good part of 7 years to achieve a steady upward trajectory for positive margin trends while the company also began to phase out the physical disk business I wasnt even aware but Netflix still mailed DVDs up to September of this year Any dying business will have a long tail and take time to phase outThat being said part of the difficult trek to profitability for Netflix had to do with the adoption of streaming Luckily streaming has now become the norm so Disney does not have to fight that battle Streaming competition is also more fierce than ever but Netflix has built a blueprint that should speed up the process to ascending margins in about half the time as it took Netflix If it took Netflix 7 years Id like to think Disney could start that trajectory in 354 years We should be near the sweet spot for margin improvementIn my previous article I looked at Disney primarily on an asset basis Since then the pricetobook value has hit even further lows Being that Disney is in a turnaround phase with lots of writeoffs and expenses I used a modified Graham number using the book value and EBITDA per share as a proxy to income Here is an update on that model for where we stand todayIn my bull case price model I will be making the following 2025 future assumptions using a Buffett Owner Earnings Model with TTM numbers bumped up by 10All numbers in millionsThis is not the first time I have written about Disney I am very interested in keeping myself abreast of the company since it has become one of my larger holdings Having traveled extensively I would have to say that Disney has maintained its brand appeal internationally even though it has deteriorated domestically It is still one of the first places on the list to visit should a foreign national set foot in one of the various locations that have a Disney ParkAs someone who leans to the right side of the political spectrum I also acknowledge what some of my readers have pointed out some liberal USbased issues have seeped into the Disney media content This is not prescient throughout the rest of the world where Disney is known solely for its Parks Hotels and retail productsI have seen recent featurelength films put out by Disney and while they were not all that impressive none of them struck me as agendabased either I must also admit that I do not stream Disney or subscribe to the linear segments but supply and demand should eventually reconfigure the offerings to a nice happy middle Simply put we are all customers and business survival will eventually come down to pleasing all of your customers Our demand will eventually modify the supply The beauty of a capitalist economy is that the customer eventually wins in the end The only way we dont is if there is someone willing to subsidize an agendaCommentary courtesy of The YOY reduction in subscribers has not gone over well as evidenced by Disney share price trends However Disney and other streaming services are going the route of higher monetization per user at this point versus service price cuts to attract a greater number of eyeballs This is bound to happen as price increases take hold and ads are placed across all the platformsDisney also has the advantage as evidenced by the Charter deal to migrate their content to other streaming services outside of Disney where companies like Netflix do not enjoy that advantage While they may not increase their subscriber revenue through this the ad revenue will still be theirs Ads on streaming will be the new norm and the key to higher marginsDisney is looking to Double Down on the Long term debt has seen a decline from its peak at near 60 Billion now down

202,Sociedad Química Y Minera De Chile: Get Ready To Buy,Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile SA  shares have derated on falling LCE Lithium Carbonate Equivalent prices and concession renewal or nationalization risk In addition I see potential for downgrades post 3Q23 results on high consensus estimates However the sharesEV auto sales and penetration are  than anticipated Falling car prices higher fuel costs government rebates and charging infrastructure expansion have combined toAfter skyrocketing to over US80kg  are back to a healthier US20kg as supply and demand balanced For SQM this is a sweet spot that allows for over 40 gross margins free cash flow to continue to fund expansion and keeps higher cost assets from entering the market at a reckless pace at US20kg makes many key  without subsidies and with high environmental costs according to recent data by  and  If spot prices continue to decline new capacity may get stalled or need to look for longterm supply contracts to fund mines and chemical conversionIn addition LCE is not yet a commodity like oil or copper actual transactions and the ability to hedge and buy forward contracts are in diapers The market is still largely based on bilateral negotiations between mining companies chemical converters battery makers and automakers Demand in China may have paused but in the USA and Europe its increasing In my view the China spot price is a guide but not likely what SQM or other nonChina companies are realizing with customersA process that promises to further enhance the cost competitiveness of brines vs rock or clay lithium fields As illustrated in an  by Goldman Sachs  the Latin American brines could expand share via lowcost environmentally benign technology DLE may reduce processing time and increase yields Thus if and when SQM can renew its concession that would very likely be accompanied by a DLE expansion project and enhance capacity and cost competitivenessPost 2Q23 guidance I have adjusted volumes and now I assume a lower LCE price of US20kg going forward vs 30k in 2H23 This may reduce gross margins from 50 to 40 as seen in the table below Note that cash cost estimates decline in YE24 as new capacity comes online SQM has been growing very rapidly adding costs faster than revenue that cant always be capexedFor the other segments of the company I assume Iodine continues to see near US70kg prices and over 60 margins Specialty fertilizers and Potash improve on higher agricultural and natural gas prices while industrial chemicals are flat I continue to value SQM at 10x EVEBITDA this has been its historic multiple and coincides with a DFC valuation and long term growth rates However the market has de rated SQM down to 5x and the consensus price target uses an implied 58x multiple This derating is also evident in many peers such as Albemarle  Livent  Ganfeng  and Tianqi Part of the rationale for this lower multiple is that LCE prices spiked and would fall which they have Yet the market continues to discount the sector due to price volatility much as is seen in the oil and iron ore sector However I believe this sector should not be considered a pure commodity given that LCE or Lithium Carbonate Equivalent as the name implies is not pure lithium this is a specialty chemical compound with varying formulationsThe second reason for SQMs derating is due to recent political risk the famous nationalization threat This is very unlikely to come to fruition for many reasons the primary one is that the current government has almost zero political power and no budget to acquire SQMs assets at a reasonable price At present there is no bill in front of Congress to enact its take over proposal of lithium assets via joint ventures where the government controls the assets 51 but does not contribute capital The only action reported by SQM and in the media is that Codelco national copper mining company has been tasked with negotiating the concession renewal which expires in 2030 In my view Chile is not going to nationalize anythingWhenif the concession renewal is announced the valuation may jump several points which would also be positive for ALB There is considerable upside risk to SQMs valuationMy current estimates that use LCE prices of US20kg from 3Q23 forward are at the low end of consensus This is a problem if SQM does realize LCE prices at this level there could be a rash of downgrades that would not be positive for the shares Thus it may be worthwhile waiting for 3Q23 result before buying the stockBuy SQM post 3Q23 results Consensus may need to correct for lower LCE prices However at US20kg for LCE prices going forward SQMs valuation is cheap at 5x EVEBITDA which has room to rerate on less volatile LCE prices and more importantly

203,AMD's Consolidation Presents Strong Price Development (Technical Analysis),  is scheduled to  for Q3 2023 postmarket on October 31 2023 While the company anticipates growth in both revenue and earnings due to robust product demand there are heightened risks stemmingIn  AMD delivered commendable revenue figures further cementing its pivotal position in the semiconductor sector Even with an operating deficit the companys financial results were noteworthy particularly from a nonGAAP perspective This piece picks up from my  offering an updated snapshot and highlighting potential investment avenues for longterm investors Notably the stock price has held its ground and its consolidation at crucial thresholds suggests a bullish price developmentIn Q2 2023 AMD reported a  of 54 billion marking a notable presence in the semiconductor industry Their official releaseDr Lisa Su AMDs Chair and CEO emphasized the significant ramping up of 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors A massive increase was observed in AI engagements with a sevenfold rise during this quarter alone This was attributed to customers initiating or expanding their programs primarily supporting the future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale The company is also gearing up for the launch and rampup of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter Segmentwise the Data Center segment revenue came in at 13 billion a decline of 11 YoY yet a sequential increase of 2 Despite facing a drop of 54 YoY due to a weaker PC market and supply chain inventory corrections the Client segment managed a sequential growth of 35 Moreover the Gaming segment faced a 4 YoY decline with its revenue being 16 billion In contrast the Embedded segment saw an uplifting 16 YoY increase totaling a revenue of 15 billionSignificant events and strategic movements also marked Q2 2023 At the Data Center and AI Technology Premier event AMD unveiled two new 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors optimized for different workloads Some of the events other highlights were partnerships with industry leaders such as Hugging Face and PyTorch and robust networking portfolios Cloud giants like AWS Alibaba Microsoft Azure and OCI embraced 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors for new instances Gaming and commercial PC users also have new products to look forward to with the introduction of the Ryzen Z1 Series processors and the Radeon RX 7600 graphics cardStrategically AMD is set to invest 135 million to amplify its adaptive computing research in Ireland targeting nextgen AI data centers and 6G communication infrastructure Finally the appointment of Phil Guido as the chief commercial officer coming from a 30year tenure at IBM promises to bring in fresh strategic insights for AMDs global operationsAMD is scheduled to announce the Q3 2023 earnings on 31 October 2023 For Q3 2023 AMD expects growth in both revenue and earnings owing to solid demand for its products The revenue is expected to hover around the 57 billion mark with a potential variation of 300 million Additionally the company projects its nonGAAP gross margin to be close to 51 Surpassing these expectations with positive results could significantly boost AMDs stock priceIn the previous article a deep dive was taken into the pronounced bullish trends observed in yearly and quarterly charts The article emphasized how the notable downturn of 2022 was counteracted by strong bullish formations suggesting a potential rise in momentum This steep decline in 2022 can be traced back to the wick on 2021s yearly candle Further insights from the quarterly charts revealed a pronounced breakout from the 382 Fibonacci retracement mark at 10225 This threshold was pivotal for bullish momentum and a second consecutive quarterly close above it only solidified this perspectiveAdditionally the critical reversal candle touching a low of 5457 backed by staunch support at the 618 Fibonacci retracement of 6383 suggests that the bottom was hit and an upward trajectory was expected The weekly chart corroborated this bullish view showcasing a completed inverted head and shoulders and a descending broadening wedge Its also worth noting that any monthly close below 10225 could hint at further declines Yet with September 2023 closing at 10282 the market seems to maintain its bullish stance To sum it up the prior article posited that the price adjustment in AMD offers a prime buying opportunity for longterm investorsAs previously discussed AMD has held its pivotal levels and now exhibits a more bullish trajectory The monthly chart below showcases the longterm foundational development from 2001 to 2019 This robust foundation was surpassed in 2019 marked by the red trendline which served as the bullish bases neckline Leading up to this breakthrough the price had carved an ascending broadening wedge delineated by the blue trendlines When these patterns were surmounted the stock witnessed a significant upward movementSeveral factors fueled this surge At the forefront AMD experienced a surge in demand for its Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors allowing it to snatch market shares from its rivals in desktop and data center domains These products standout performance and efficiency branded AMD as a potent contender against established market leaders Furthermore the global semiconductor landscape saw a general uptick propelled by the digital revolution during COVID19 growing cloud computing needs and the increasing integration of electronics across industries AMDs strategic alliances relentless innovation and successful roadmap implementation amplified investor trust reflected in the stocks impressive performance during this periodNevertheless as highlighted in the previous discussion the markets robust correction halted at 5456 This bounceback is a positive sign hinting at a potential upward journey Moreover the RSI on the monthly chart is comfortably above 50Conversely the updated weekly chart highlights the stocks challenge in sustaining above the blue trendline The pullback from the peak of 13283 is attributed to fulfilling the descending broadening wedge patterns target Additionally the RSI has edged above its midpoint suggesting potential support at this crucial levelMoreover the latest market pullback is better visualized on the subsequent weekly chart It reveals a correction from 13283 that has formed a bull flag pattern A breach above 125 could potentially trigger a significant upward rally The observation underlines the bullish stance for AMD reinforced by a pronounced inverted head and shoulders pattern with the head at 5457 and shoulders at 7160 and 8102 combined with the emerging bullish flagInvestors may consider increasing long positions at the present rates given that the consolidation at critical levels coupled with the appearance of a bull flag and inverted head and shoulders signals an upward momentumVarious factors including global supply chain dynamics and inventory adjustments threaten AMDs performance and stability The notable 54 YoY drop in the Client segment due to a struggling PC market and supply chain inventory changes underscores this vulnerability While the company has shown the capability to manage certain industry pitfalls continued disruptions or any imbalance between supply and demand can jeopardize its revenue profit margins and its place in the competitive landscapeExternal macroeconomic factors such as potential economic downturns geopolitical unrest and unexpected global incidents can further unsettle AMDs operations and stock value The competitive landscape is also challenging especially when viewed against the backdrop of Intels earnings Underperformance against these market expectations especially in critical areas like data centers or client sales can cause significant stock price fluctuations Additionally the possibility of competitors introducing groundbreaking technologies or aggressive pricing strategies remains a consistent threat to AMDs market dominance On a technical note if the stock closes below 10225 in a month it could drop to 6382 but a monthly close beneath 6383 would challenge the longterm optimistic forecastAMD displayed a robust revenue performance in Q2 2023 asserting its prominence in the semiconductor sector While the company faced particular challenges such as an operating loss its nonGAAP figures and continued growth under Dr Lisa Sus leadership spotlight its potential and adaptability The introduction of the latest EPYC and Ryzen processors coupled with a significant rise in AI engagements underscores AMDs forward momentum Various segments within the company showed mixed results with major product releases and strategic partnerships further enhancing the companys market position AMDs upcoming investment in Ireland showcases its commitment to pioneering advancements in adaptive computing However the future brings both optimistic projections and uncertainties due to broader economic influencesFrom a technical standpoint AMD displays a robust bullish trend through pronounced price patterns The appearance of the inverted head and shoulders combined with the bull flag formation bolsters the bullish argument presented in the previous article As a result investors might think about increasing long positions to capitalize on the potential upward surge AMD is set to reveal its Q3 2023 earnings in a few days which could catalyze AMDs next significant movement   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No

204,Buy The Big Dip In The Utility Sector With 9.8% Yield: UTF,"Have you ever heard the saying all theories are great in theory The truth is that most theories or ideas rarely play out as preplanned or expected The cold harshness of reality can wreak havocMovements in the stock market can be viewed as a series of competing theories or ideas that collide around companies or sectors Some view bond alternatives as terrible investments when rates rise while others view them as excellent companies now trading at more attractive prices  perspectives and theories crashing into each otherThe reality is that an excellently run company can rapidly see its price decline due to no other fact than investors with a herd mentality following a popular theory or viewpointThe utility sector has been hit hard recently crashingWeve already seen several utility names adjust their growth outlooks due to higher costs of capital Infrastructure is often expensive to build and building new infrastructure is usually funded in large part by debt Almost any infrastructure investment can be characterized as providing a large amount of upfront capital and then collecting a very longterm income stream Higher interest rates make building new infrastructure less appealing so less is builtMeanwhile higher interest rates also impact the present value of existing income streams Investing 100 million to receive 7 millionyear for decades sounded like a great deal just two years ago Today it isnt because interest rates are higherSo I wont call the market crazy for selling utilities in the near term Growth is going to be slower and the cost of capital is making it difficult for utilities to grow while making the present value of future cash flows lowerI will say it is very shortsighted There are two sides to every economic transaction  supply and demand One party provides something and another wants something The price of the transaction is determined by the interaction between the two What happens if utilities slow expansion There is less electricity and the supply is lower Is demand going to decline as well Not likely Whether interest rates are 1 5 10 or 30 living without electricity is not a solution that many are likely to pursue Economics 101 What happens when supply is low and demand is high Prices go up Rising prices are good for those who are on the supply side of the equationWe can already see this with oil companies Oil prices are more reactive to supply changes which is why oil companies are doing very well despite higher capital costs while other utilities have been strugglingThe price of electricity is going up And as the expansion of electric supply slows down it is only going to go higher When gas prices go up you see it at the pump fairly quickly and it is very common to see the price of gas at your favored station change daily Electric companies generally are not allowed to increase prices month to month Your bill will vary primarily based on how much electricity you consume monthly In most jurisdictions prices will be raised or lowered once a year with government approval As with all bureaucratic processes it takes time the authorities will often push back against the raises requested but eventually nobody can fight the economic reality of supply and demand Attempts to do so lead to unpleasant things like rolling brownoutsInfrastructure investments like electric companies have been dealing with pressures from higher rates and delays from benefiting from inflation and the supplydemand balance is looking very favorable for them

205,What I Wish I Knew Before Buying High Yield Stocks,Thanks to the rapid rise of interest rates over the past year and a half alongside geopolitical inflationary and other macroeconomic headwinds high yield stocks have rarely been more attractively priced than they are today Just take a look at what some ofClearly there is an attractive combination of value and quality available in the high yield space That said the sector is far from a guaranteed ticket to financial independence and riches For every high quality and sustainable high yield stock out there there are many more that are ticking time bombs As a result while high yield investing can certainly be a very lucrative and rewarding approach to investing it a requires knowledgeable prudent approach to avoid suffering large longterm lossesHere are two lessons that I wish I had learned before investing in high yielding stocksMany times management teams will make rosy projections about their companys ability to deliver strong longterm growth alongside paying out a very attractive dividend While management does hopefully have the clearest view of the performance of and outlook for their business they do not always share an honest assessment of the true state of their business Sometimes they may even be giving their best assessment but they lack the foresight to properly understand the macroeconomic andor competitive threats coming their wayTwo classic examples of this from my own experience were Algonquin Power  Utilities  and Lumen Technologies AQN had a very impressive history of delivering a consistent 10 dividend per share CAGR over the course of about a decade The company had a robust growth pipeline fueled by a powerful onetwo punch of its renewables business segment and its regulated utilities business segment Moreover it had an investment grade balance sheet and the dividend yield looked quite attractive at over 5 following a pullback in the stock price With management continuing to guide for robust dividend growth in the years to come I bought shares taking management at its wordHowever if I had taken more care to look under the hood I would have seen that they actually had considerable exposure to floating interest rates and were taking on a lot of leverage to finance their aggressive growth pipeline With interest rates soaring in 2022 AQN got caught swimming naked when the tide went out to borrow from a  As a result it was forced to slash its dividend and the stock price plunged burning me and many other gullible investors who had trusted managements guidanceFortunately in the case of LUMN I sold before the massive dividend cut but this was another case of a company that continued to speak glowingly of its strong growth potential that would be fueled by the 4th Industrial Revolution all while also pitching its 1 per share dividend as a top capital allocation priority that would be sustained through the pivot to growthOnce management quietly removed this priority from its slide show I asked the company point blank about it and they tried to talk around it Thankfully I sensed something was going on and sold my shares and sure enough shortly thereafter management not only cut the dividend but actually totally eliminated it Since then the stock has completely cratered as it has failed miserably in its efforts to pivot to growth Sadly investors who failed to jump ship have been burned badly as over the past year LUMN stock has lost over 84 of its valueWhile management guidance and commentary can be very useful never ever take it as gospel truth Do your own due diligence Ask hard questions when you get a chance to speak to a company Oftentimes how they answer questions on earnings calls and when you speak with them says as much if not more than what they actually sayAnother lesson I wish that I had learned before investing in high yield stocks is that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors Yes I am a bottomup investor who focuses on companylevel fundamentals and valuations when making investment decisions and I generally do not make macroeconomic forecasts and therefore do not make my investment decisions based on where I think the economy is headed However that does not mean that I should be totally blind to what is happening in the broader economy when allocating capitalWhat I mean by this is that sometimes it is clear what is going on in the broader economy and what the ramifications will be for a stock in my portfolio Even if the stock looks deeply undervalued and likely to deliver attractive returns over the course of a full economic cycle it may be apparent that the current economic situation will cause excessive distress for the business As a result market sentiment may be highly likely to remain negative on the stock for the foreseeable future and in some cases a dividend cut may be highly likely as well further exacerbating market sentimentA classic example of this was recently seen in the apparel sector A stock that I owned was Hanesbrands  It had recently brought on an impressive new CEO who was previously a senior executive at Walmart  and was implementing an impressive plan to improve the companys brands supply chain and operating efficiencies However it quickly became apparent that a perfect storm of macro events was transpiring that were leading to an unmistakable solution Inflation was soaring interest rates were spiking a prolonged imbalance in supply and demand and an out of the blue cyberattack on the company exacerbated its fairly heavily leveraged balance sheet and left management with little choice but to eliminate the dividend Throughout this entire process the stock price continued to plummet yet given my focus on the longterm disconnect between supply and demand and principled agnostic approach to macro factors I held the whole way down through the dividend cut Given that I am an income investor I ended up selling the stock after the dividend was eliminatedIn hindsight I should have seen the writing on the wall much earlier in the process and sold the stock at a much smaller loss than I ended up doing after the dividend was eliminated Granted I got lucky and was able to recycle the capital into New York Community Bancorp  right near its bottom during the March crash in the banking sector leading to me gaining back much of my losses on HBI in short order However my handling of the HBI investment was still a clear mistake Was my initial investment a mistake in the sense that my reasoning was wrong I dont believe so The fundamentals and valuation seemed to clearly indicate that HBI was undervalued but the macroeconomic and black swan factors  which are highly unpredictable  conspired against it and sent the stock tumbling This is just part of investing and is why I diversify my portfolio However my mistake was holding HBI for as long as I did despite the clear headwinds facing the stock I should have just eaten my losses and moved on at a much earlier stage in the processNow is clearly an exceptional time to invest in high yield stocks given where valuations sit However investors should not jump in head first into the sector recklessly Many high yield stocks are high yield for a reasonWhile I certainly value managements opinion and listen closely to the earnings calls investor presentations and the answers they give in my interviews with them I have learned the hard way that just because a management team says that its high yield is safe does not mean that it really isMoreover while I am a big believer in taking a bottomup approach to investing and not making investment decisions based on macroeconomic forecasts I also believe that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors once it becomes obvious that they are going to force one of your holdings to slash its dividend and potentially even face financial distressBy taking these lessons along

206,There Might Not Be Another Chance Like This For Years,There is a crazy mismatch in the market right now as it concerns real estate investment trusts REITs between  and Secondquarter REIT earnings releases thus far have been almostCompare the 12month performance of the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  to that of the SP 500  and Nasdaq 100Index The market seems to be convinced that REITs are facing serious and longlasting headwinds that will meaningfully damage their ability to grow in the long run Therefore many investors are avoiding REITs altogether rather than looking for valueWe think this pessimistic sentiment basicallyLets address all three points and finish by taking a look at five highquality REITs trading at what we view as crazy discounts to their fair values and fundamental performancesOn the first point if you watch financial media for any length of time youll inevitably hear commentators equating commercial real estate with office buildings and we all know the difficulties facing office real estate right now amid the new hybrid work environmentEven industry insiders sometimes equate the two See for example the title given to this sentiment survey from the Real Estate RoundtableThe survey is about  CRE but stress in  CRE in particular appears to be dragging down sentiment for all CREWhat about the idea that a big drop in downtown office utilization and values will have a negative effect on the cities in which theyre located Keep in mind that most nonoffice real estate properties and most of the properties in REITs portfolios are located  of downtown areasIt isnt a big leap in the mind of the average investor to go from commercial real estate to REITs You need only look at the occupancy rates of the four main sectors of CRE to discover that REITs do not equal officeWhile office occupancy has indeed plummeted since the onset of COVID19 occupancy of apartments retail and industrial remains at or near their highsThe market treats REITs as totally helpless in the face of rising interest rates almost mechanically discounting REITs as rates ratchet higherBut the market seems to forget that REITs have professional management teams whose job it is to maximize rent and minimize interest costs Most of them do a very good job at thisHence we find that REITs total FFO has surged higher since the onset of COVID19Moreover REITs weighted average debt maturity sits at about 8 years and generally speaking relatively few of their loans mature and require refinancing on any given year During the low interest rate period of 2020 and 2021 REITs very actively refinanced debt pushing out maturity dates as far as they could Many of them like Alexandria Real Estate  and NNN REIT  refinanced expiring debt with 30year bonds during that periodThat is why the weighted average interest rate on REITs debt has only barely budged higher in the last year even as interest rates have surgedOf course the longer interest rates remain elevated the higher their weighted average interest rates will go But while higher rates are a shortterm headwind they can be a longterm tailwind because of the next pointIn the long run higher interest rates combined with higher labor and construction costs act as a massive boon to commercial real estate and especially to REITs because it will result in far fewer new development projects coming to marketAs we all learned in Econ 101 the economy is basically operated on supply and demand If the supply of something stays flat while demand grows the price typically goes up This is true of real estate as much as for any other sector of the economyWhen interest rates and input costs go up development of new real estate properties grinds to a halt which leads to fewer new properties coming to market to compete with the existing stock a year or two down the roadThats exactly what weve seen happening over the last year or so in the CRE development industryHeres a chart showing sentiment among CRE developers related to their views of whether various components will be higher or lower in 12 months timeAs you can see over the past year they have mostly viewed occupancy and rents as headed higher while construction and labor costs have likewise headed higher Only recently have developers started to see the light at the end of the tunnel for construction costs  envisioning an end to materials cost increasesWhat does this do to development activity It causes much less of it to be greenlitTake a look at this chart of industrial on the left and multifamily on the right construction starts going back 10 yearsAlthough starts spiked in 2021 and early 2022 they have since  to very low levels as the costs of land labor materials and capital have soared The same thing is happening all across the CRE spectrum right now Very few new projects are breaking ground for any type of real estateWhat does this mean for REITs It means that after the manageable wave of new supply of properties comes to market this year and next year there will be a steep dropoff in 20252026 and potentially beyond thatLess supply combined with growing demand should result in rising rent ratesLets briefly look at five REITs that we believe exhibit this huge mismatch between strong fundamental performance and weak investor sentiment To illustrate well just use one valuation metric price to operating cash flow or CFO because cash flow is one of real estates primary channels of delivering returnsFirst off   a triplenet lease REIT focused on investment grade singletenant retail properties leased to the nations leading retailers like Walmart  TJ Maxx  Tractor Supply Co  and Home Depot ADC enjoys a BBB credit rating very little debt maturing before 2028 the highest quality tenant roster in the net lease REIT space and a skilled management team And yet ADC is near its cheapest valuation of any time in the last five yearsAt a price of around 69 ADC trades at a price to AFFO of 175x compared to its 5year average of 196xNext up consider   the only pureplay life science REIT that owns and develops stateoftheart Class A research  development properties in the nations most innovative research clusters The REIT just  an earnings beat on continued strong demand for its toptier lab space even if leasing and rent rate growth is normalizing from its elevated COVIDera levels ARE also enjoys a BBB credit rating and no debt maturing before 2025And yet partially in response to activist REIT investor Jonathan Litts short report the REIT trades near its lowest valuation in 5 yearsAt a price of 12750 ARE trades at a price to AFFO of 169x compared to its 5year average of 255xMuch the same could be said about USbased telecommunications REIT   which owns a vast network of wireless towers small cells and fiber across the country The market seems to be focused on the fact that management slightly trimmed AFFO per share guidance for 2023 lowering their growth estimate from 3 to 2Moreover the market also seems pessimistic about managements repeated assertion that CCI will be able to return to growth after 2025 when the last of Sprints lease cancellations take effect Given the huge rise in mobile data usage and carriers need to continue investing to facilitate that traffic I believe management in their assertion that dividend growth will return to 78 annually in 2026 and beyond In the meantime CCIs BBB credit rating and modest debt maturities in 20232024 exude strengthAnd yet CCIs valuation has gone off a cliffAt a price of 11250 CCI trades at a price to AFFO of 149x compared to its 5year average of 230xTurning to the selfstorage space we believe one of the strongest names in this area is   which recently solidified its scale advantage by acquiring peer Life Storage EXR now commands the 1 market share in US selfstorage at 132 of the market Like ARE EXRs ultrastrong pandemicera performance is in the process of normalizing especially as the housing market cools and fewer people are moving EXR also enjoys a BBB credit rating and a manageable amount of debt maturing this year and next yearAnd yet the market is valuing EXR  than it did prior to COVID19At a price of 14450 EXR trades at a price to AFFO of 170x compared to its 5year average of 223xFinally in the industrial space consider   the premier owner of highquality infill industrial properties in the extremely supplyconstrained Southern California market Management calls the industrial supply shortage in Southern California virtually incurable and this shortage has spurred peerleading rent and NOI growth Over the last five years REXRs NOI has grown at a CAGR of 39 and after Q2 2023 inplace rents on its existing portfolio remained 50 below market implying significant organic growth aheadREXR is truly firing on all cylinders while also enjoying one of the strongest balance sheets in REITdom with a BBB credit rating and yet the market is pricing it significantly  than it was before COVID19At a price of 5675 REXR trades at a price to AFFO of 260x compared to its 5year average of 395xREIT fundamentals across almost all sectors remain strong and the decrease in development activity today implies that a favorable supply environment will be in effect in a few years time And yet the market is pricing many toptier REITs as if growth is coming to an end and temporarily elevated interest rates will

207,Tesla: Onward And Upward,During 3Q23   produced 430488 vehicles and delivered 435059 Last quarter the company produced and delivered 479700 and 466140 automobiles The sequential decline was anticipated as TSLA had announced downtime at its production facilities for upgrades duringTSLA is  Q3 2023 financial results on or about October 19 For the period analysts anticipate 247 billion in revenues and 065 in GAAP earnings per share Based on the number of Teslas delivered during the quarter we expect actual results to come in below consensus estimates on the top line and bottom line However although we anticipate a decline in revenues on a quarteroverquarter basis due to the shortfall in the sequentialWith respect to margins despite the softer revenues we expect higher gross margins on a sequential basis driven by the increase in Model Y MSRP decrease in commodity prices labor efficiencies due to greater automation and depreciation However profit margins are likely to come in lighter on a quarteroverquarter basis based on expenses related to the ramp in production associated with the Cybertruck and the Megapack as well as additional spending on artificial intelligence Consequently earnings per share are likely to decline compared to the previous quarter while coming in higher than a year agoConsidering that the TSLA story has not radically shifted during the third quarter we reiterate our 492share Price Target derived utilizing a 10year Discounted Cash Flow model that incorporates a 10year normalized revenue growth rate of 50 a profit margin of 10 operating cash flow margin of 18 yearly capital expenditures of 2 average cost of capital of 7 and a perpetual growth rate of 3 Reiterate Buy Rating With whispers that Cybertruck launch paraphernalia is being sent out it appears that the vehicles debut event is drawing close Given that pickup truck sales account for 20 of the US automobile market the lack of a pickup truck among TSLAs models was a glaring gap that was necessary to plug Therefore we are excited about the Cybertruck eventually becoming a realityIn regard to the competition Ford Motor Companys  FSeries vehicles are the bestselling pickup trucks in America followed by General Motors  Chevrolet Silverado models Fs F150 Lightning is an EV pickup truck with a range of 320 miles towing facility of 7700 lbs and MSRP of 50000 on the base model Chevrolet Silverado EV version has a range of 400 miles towing capacity of 10000 lbs and a price tag of 52000 on the base model Relatively the Cybertruck has a range of up to 500 miles and towing facility of 14000 lbs Nevertheless we view the entire lineup of Ford FSeries and Chevrolet Silverado models including the internal combustible engine ICE pickup trucks as potential competition for the CybertruckAlthough based on the Cybertrucks novel features and specifications we expect strong demand outofthegate deliveries are likely to initially lag demand due to the manufacturing complexity associated with the vehicle However as demand continues to ratchet the gap between supply and demand is likely to narrow as TSLA allocates additional resources to benefit from the popularity of the Cybertruck In our opinion sales of the Cybertruck which given the vehicles niche appearance is considered to lack mass appeal will surprise significantly on the upsideIn addition although our argument might appear cliched similar to the iPhone the Cybertruck represents a paradigm shift within its industry The iPhone captured customer attention because of the additional value it provided relative to other smartphones We believe the incremental value the Cybertruck provides over the typical pickup truck will reflect in a surge in vehicle sales over time In our opinion the UAW strike afflicting F GM and Stellantis  is unlikely to benefit TSLA Although we believe that the shutdown at the factories of the impacted firms is likely to be successful the companies will absorb the increase in labor costs rather than risk raising product prices and turning uncompetitive The automobile industry is highly profitable in absolute dollar terms with F and GM guiding to 2023 net income of between 10 billion to 12 billion and 93 billion to 107 billion respectively Considering that labor costs account for 4 to 5 of the average cost of producing a vehicle the impact of higher employee wages and benefits on the bottom line is unlikely to be cripplingMoreover it is hardly a zerosum game Up until the UAW demanded a resurrection of the living wage raises defined pension plans and removal of wage tiers the requests appear reasonable However when it comes to wrangling a 40 pay raise for workers the UAW terms appear onerous and will only escalate the trend towards automation of core production functions at automobile companies in our judgmentNetnet a potential success of the UAW strike will likely decrease profit margins at F GM and STLA over the short term Longer term the impasse represents a margin expansion opportunity as hiring is replaced by automation bolstering our argument that Fs GMs and STLAs loss is not TSLAs gain The Inflation Reduction Act IRA mandate including 400 billion in funding to encourage the purchase of green energy technologies matches up nicely with TSLAs mission to design manufacture and market products that accelerate the earths transformation to renewable energy Consequently along with customer subsidies on the MSRP of a majority of TSLAs EV models the companys energy storage solutions are similarly advantaged with retail and corporate purchases of the firms battery storage systems Powerwall and Megapack eligible for up to 30 in tax credits on the cost of the productsIn addition the IRA has earmarked 12 billion in entitlements to escalate the development and deployment of clean energy systems in rural communities across America which will necessitate the utilization of battery storage technologies In that regard it is noteworthy that the US Department of Agriculture USDA entrusted with managing the venture has received funding requests for up to 2x the 97 billion overlay allocated by Federal authorities In addition given our opinion that the nation is highly likely to achieve the target of 60 solarwind generated power by 2030 compared to the current 13 large utility companies are likely to turn to TSLA for their battery storage requirements as they shift the electricity grid towards dependence on renewable energy sourcesFurther it is notable that TSLAs energy storage business is global with megascale projects that depend on the firms Megapacks active in Europe and Australia with additional projects under development in the geographies Moreover TSLA recently tabled a proposal with the Indian government to produce and market the Powerwall in the country Although Indian officials balked at providing the firm with incentives for manufacturing it appears that subsidizing customer purchases of the Powerwall is under discussionWith the Megapack backordered until Q3 2024 and favorable market conditions TSLA appears to be increasing focus on its energy storage business In that regard it launched a Megafactory in China over the summer and has stated that its objective is to add several facilities over the short termOverall with what appears to be another strong quarter behind it TSLA is wellpositioned to charge ahead Onward and upwardConsidering the highly volatile nature of TSLA shares they undoubtedly offer an opportunity to generate returns through day trading and other short holding period arrangements However TSLA is an investment story not a trading story Folks that Buy and Hold TSLA stock for longer time horizons are like to secure greater gains on investment with virtually zero risk relative to traders timing the market in the companys sharesTesla Inc is a prudently managed firm with products that are key participants in growing markets with fragmented competition We believe TSLA has high growth in revenues and earnings locked in for at least the next ten years Buy Buy Buy on pullbacks   Past performance is no guarantee of

208,Adyen Simplified,I recently produced an indepth review of Adyens   H1 2023 report as well asWhile I feel I was as comprehensive as possible in my review I recently came across market share data that has been in my mind over the years for Adyen but which Ive been unable to locate As I mentioned in the introductory bullet points this data is in some sense the entire thesisSpecifically this data illustrates a few key aspects of the Adyen investment thesisWith these ideas as our platform lets begin this abridged version of my Adyen thesisAs Ive shared in the past Adyen could likely be considered to be the best FinTech on earth presently Perhaps it could be argued that Stripe  holds this crown but as the data in the concluding thoughts of this note will reveal Adyen is a vastly more capitalefficient business relative to Stripe while growing at essentially parity and while having fielded a platform at essentially product and feature parityAdditionally as the TAM data that I will share with you in a moment demonstrates Adyen has a very long runway for growthSo we have a fantastic combination of quality and capital efficiency alongside elevated growth prospectsWith these ideas in mind lets turn to a review of Adyens valuationFor a company that could grow sales and by extension free cash flow per share at 20 which would be below managements guidance annualized for the next 10 years a 34 free cash flow yield is quite fantasticAnd this does not include future share repurchase programs which its legacy peers such as Fiserv  have executed with brilliant successTo add just a bit of extra information here by which you may become a more educated investor Adyens 34 yield is quite attractive in light of its growth prospects and in light of the reality that it is likely the best FinTech on earth This yield is vastly vastly more attractive than the sub 2 yield investors were offered historicallyAdditionally the rise of Adyens yield is not mysteriousOn the heels of the fastest interest rate hiking cycle in American history the 10 year treasury yield against which Adyens yield principally competes for investor capital the result of which influences supply and demand for Adyens security therefore share price now finds itself at about 46Academic finance suggests that Adyen should trade such that we get the risk free rate  risk premium which would suggest that Ayden should trade with a free cash flow yield of 5For current owners this likely sounds like a scary prospect but for prospective owners such a valuation would likely yield 25 or quite likely more annualized returns in the decades ahead as the company grows at 20 and begins repurchasing sharesAll of this being said Adyen does not offer a risk premium nor does its yield trade at parity with the 10 year treasury yield and I believe this makes sense While investors in the 10 year will only receive 49 per annum granted they hold to maturity investors in Adyen will witness the free cash flow yield note not actual yield on their investment grow very materially in the decade ahead especially if Adyen begins repurchasing shares with its excess free cash flow which it likely will at some point in the decade aheadThe principal impetus behind crafting this abridged version of the Adyen thesis was my recent receipt of the TAM data that has eluded me for the last couple of years or soAdyen like essentially all of our businesses has grown within a giant TAM populated by legacy incumbents and a diverse set of point solutionsAdyen has vertically integrated the aforementioned point solutions into one acquiring platform tech stack and it has done so on a single source of code This has resulted in a more featurerich costeffective and versatile platform especially for global multinational enterprises which has afforded Adyen the market share capture we can see in the chart belowAdditionally we can see the highly fragmented nature of this industry within which Adyen continues to grow due to the nature of its platform That is its growth within this fragmented TAM has been a byproduct of the nature and configuration of its platform which you may review belowAdyen is a quintessential example of a business that fits within my Inverse Bubble Framework a term I coined as well as our first and third foundational investment frameworks  As I mentioned towards the introduction of this note Adyen is arguably the best FinTech on earth at present and the financial data below confirms this reality in my mindAs we can see Adyens leadership has demonstrated a  aptitude for capital allocation relative to the leadership of StripeAdyen has grown faster with vastly less required capital and Adyen and Stripe are effectively at product parity todayTo close some have told me they do not like FinTech to which I would respond Fair but have you seen the returns of legacy FinTechs from whom Adyen or Marqeta continue to capture market shareBelow we can see the returns of Fiserv and Global Payments over the last 40 and 20 years respectivelyToday we have the opportunity to buy the very very best FinTechs on earth at value  to deep value Both of these businesses have truly giant cash hoards and no debt as well as very profitable unit economics and long runways for growthThank you for reading and have a great dayEditors Note This article discusses

209,BP: Significantly Undervalued At Current Oil Prices,BP  is a wellknown major oil player from the UK which has faced challenging conditions in a difficult oil market for the last three years Despite drastic events Deepwater Horizon shale oil expansion COVID Rosneft writeoff the company remained aAt the end of the second quarter 2023 BP had 1738 bn shares outstanding and a total market cap

compare the 5 oil majors by implementing a score system 14 23 32 41 50 BP will take the leadBP has introduced a dividend policy which regularly increases the annual distribution by 4 at 60 per barrel Brent oil after cutting the payout in half in the second quarter of 2020 from 105 centsquarter to 525 centsquarter when the pandemic hit the economy Since then BP has raised the quarterly dividend to 727 cents 385 or 115 pa which exceeds the policy increase of 4 At current oil prices above 80 per barrel it is very likely that BP can increase the payout by 10 annually at leastFurthermore BP is strongly committed to share buybacks of at least  In 2023 BP allocates 60 of surplus cashflow due to high oil prices Since the end of 2019 BP has already reduced share count by 141 from 20241 bn to

At a current share price of 645 and if oil prices remain above 80 BP will buy back nearly 1 billion shares each year which represents a buyback yield of more than 5 Hence the dividend and buyback yield combined is close to 10BPs earnings have been volatile for years because of major shocks which have been mentioned before COVID Rosneft However earnings have always recovered strongly when the environment for oil prices were beneficial What is the current outlook for oil prices and the most likely scenarioThe most important influences on oil prices are supply and demand 1 economic growth 2 and OPEC policy 3Oil prices have recently risen to 91 WTI and 95 Brent per barrel an increase of 33 since June Global oil demand is expected to rise to while supply plunged to 1009 mbd in July In July

for the next months which will support current oil price levelsThe global economic output will  Growth is driven by India China and other emerging markets while Europes economy will be outpaced Economic growth will stabilize oil prices as well as global air traffic which  The global demand for travel is continuously high and consequently it is likely that global air traffic will surpass prepandemic levels which will also boost global oil demandOPEC supply fell to 502 mbd in July because of a reduced production of Saudi Arabia The OPEC countries are interested in a tight market and wont add a significant amount of supply to the global oil production The group announced a total of 37 mbd output cut in April and a revision of this decision is unlikely OPEC produces nearly 50 and OPEC 33 of global oil supply The output cut will limit a production expansion and oil supply wont keep up with economic growth and demand Hence the OPEC policy supports high oil prices in the near futureAll in all a scenario with high oil prices above 80 is very likely 60 and has consequences for BPs valuationThe first scenario with the highest probability shows a significant undervaluation of BP Even if we reduce the buyback amount of 6 bn by 700800 million share based compensation the buyback yield in combination with future dividend increases support an upside potential of more than 50 Furthermore the downside risks are limited as the worst scenario for oil majors still signals an undervaluation for BP The higher oil prices climb the more likely and faster BP can surpass prepandemic dividend levelsBP is not only undervalued compared to its peers the companys shares still would have upside potential if oil prices fell which is not very likely nearterm A combination of economic growth limited oil supply growth and an increasing demand for air travel are excellent conditions for BP shareholders In the scenario of high oil prices above 80 per barrel they can expect increasing dividends and a buyback yield of at least 5 Finally the shares have a significant upside potential of 55Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US

210,SPY: You Have Been Warned By Jerome Powell,The notion that history doesnt repeat itself but rhymes in the stock market encapsulates the idea that while each financial eraTypically stocks and treasury yields interest rates are inversely proportional As riskfree interest rates rise equitiesHowever as soon as longduration 10year treasury yields broke past previous cycle highs at 425 the SP500 formed a local top in midJuly and has since declined by nearly 8 with 10year treasury yields soaring to new cycle highs of 5001 last weekNow the rally off of October 2022 lows has been characterized by extremely poor breadth with nearly all of the equity market returns from the last twelve months being generated by a select few megacap tech companies that carry heavy weighting in major market indicesInterestingly the rally in big tech has been driven by significant PE multiple expansion and not fundamental earnings growth Given the steep rise in longduration treasury yields such a multiple expansion goes against common sense and financial logic The only reasonable explanation is that investors are piling into big tech names due to their safehaven status massive free cash flow generation and robust balance sheets as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to pile up in the economy In one of my recent notes I shared my views on the significant concentration into bigcap tech and its risks to the Nasdaq100 Now from a historical standpoint I am seeing a lot of parallels between 2023 and 1987  the year of the Black Monday crash In a similar vein to 2023 we can observe a sharp rise in equities and longduration treasury yields through the summer of 1987 an anomalous breakdown of the stock and bond yield relationship And as you can see on the chart below the rally of 1987 ended with a violent crash in the stock market on Black Monday 19th October 1987 with investors fleeing into treasury bonds in a flight to safety trade causing a sharp decline in treasury yieldsIn todays note we will try to find an answer to this question but before we do that lets understand the drivers of this ongoing wild runup in longduration treasury yieldsOn the back of a 40year bull run in the bond market 19822022 treasury yields have spiked up over the last eighteen months as the Fed has tightened its monetary policy to combat the pandemicinduced inflation ending the era of free moneyDuring this tightening cycle the Fed has already raised the Federal Funds rate from 0 to 55 and reduced its balance sheet assets by 1T through runoff of treasury and mortgage securities at the rate of 95B per monthWhile inflation has moderated rapidly since peaking out in 2022 it is still running well above the  target of 2 September CPI 37 yy With persistent labor market tightness unemployment rate 38 and strong economic data central bankers refuse to declare victory in its war on inflation and rightly so given past inflationary episodesFor several months the Fed has insisted that a higher rates for longer policy will be kept in place until the inflation genie is put back into the bottle And in his recent address on monetary policy at the New York Economic Club Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open to more rate hikes despite strong indication of a pause in the hike cycle due to tightening of financial conditions caused by the ongoing surge in long duration treasury yieldsNow as we know the  monetary tightening actions and higher interest rates for longer stance explain the move higher in shortduration treasury yields However longduration treasury bonds have absolutely collapsed in recent monthsAmid a bear steepening longterm interest rates outpacing shortterm interest rates the US treasury yield curve has been uninverting rapidly And as of writing the spread between 10year and 2year treasury yields has narrowed down to just 16 bps from more than 100bps just a few weeks agoHistorically yield curve uninversions have occurred right before the start of economic recessions and while stock market investors are big on the idea of a soft landing with SP500 trading at 19x PE leading economic indicators continue to point towards an imminent slowdownNow higher longduration bond yields mean tighter financial conditions and slower economic activity While the bond market is doing some muchneeded work on behalf of the Fed in the fight against inflation the velocity of this move up in longduration yields is quite incredible and the longer this goes on the greater the chance of something breaking in the financial system that eventually leads to a hard landing recession in the economyDuring the QA session of his appearance at the New York Economic Club last week Powell on being queried about his understanding of the runup in the long end of the treasury yield curve listed out multiple theories that could explain the surge higher in longduration treasury yields Given the continued strength in the economy tight labor market and strong GDP growth higher interest rates are becoming an ineffective tool for slowing down economic activity or that rates just havent been higher for longer US government debt 336T current fiscal deficit 17T massive treasury issuance from the government Powell said  we are on an unsustainable path fiscally  reduction of Feds balance sheet assets Fed moving from buyer to seller investors are demanding a higher term premium due to growing expectations that the world is moving into an environment of more supply shocks than demand shocksAnd followed that up with the following commentsBy pointing toward supplydemand dynamics my opinion is that Powell essentially admitted that the Fed has lost control of the long end of the yield curve While the Feds rate hiking campaign is likely on pause for now the door has been left open for future rate hikes More importantly with inflation still running well above its target rate of 2 and Q3 US GDP growth projected to come in at 4 the Fed is unlikely to ease monetary policy switch back to QE quantitative easing in the foreseeable future And without the Fed buying up government treasuries the wild runup in longduration yields may continue for a while pressurizing valuations of risk assetsSince treasury bonds are backed by the full faith of the US government their yields are considered the riskfree rate in the investing world In a normalized environment risk assets like equities tend to offer a premium of 23 on top of this riskfree rate Hence at this time the SP500 should ideally command an earnings yield of 78 riskfree rate 10year treasury yield of 5  equity risk premium of 23By inverting this 78 earnings yield we get to a Pricetoearnings multiple of 1251428x for the SP500 Considering forward 2024 earnings estimates of 245 for the SP500 the market is currently trading at a forward PE of 19x According to the yield math shared above SP500 should be trading 2535 lower than current levels ie in the 2800 to 3200 rangeIn addition to this yieldbased repricing I see additional risk for the SP500 since consensus analyst estimates are looking for 12 yy earnings growth in 2024 heading into a potential recession If we do end up getting a garden variety recession SP500 earnings could drop by 1520 next year And in that bearish scenario the SP500 could drop down as low as 2200 to 2640 2024 SP500 earnings 176185 PE multiple 1251428xFrom a valuation standpoint theres ample room for a significant derating in the SP500 with its Shiller PE ratio 2887x sitting at extremely elevated levels as you can see on the chart belowYes the yield math could change quickly if longduration treasury yields moved back down to 202021 lows however current economic conditions are unsupportive of such a lowinterest rate environment A Fed pivot and reintroduction of QEinfinitum is probably the only thing that can push rates down to such depths and while I do expect the Fed to revert back to QE at some point in the future I believe the Fed Put is currently inactive due to strong economy and high inflation This reality doesnt change until and unless something breaks in the financial markets or the economy And honestly if something does break we could see a  crash in the financial markets before the Fed pivots back to quantitative easingOn the back of a sizeable pullback since midJuly the SP500 is currently testing the support trendline from the COVID19 March 2020 and the October 2022 lows With weekly RSI and MACD indicators rolling over a massive technical breakdown here is very much on the tableIf longduration treasury yields hold up at elevated levels or continue to climb higher over the coming sessions equity market selling could pick up here accompanied by a potential spike in VIX CBOE Volatility Index which rallied past the 20 level last weekThe SP500 SPY has support in the 410 to 420 range however if we break those levels then all bets are off and yes we could even see the SP500 experiencing a crash similar to 1987That said so far in 2023 SPY has followed seasonality patterns quite well and numerous analysts have cited strong past performance trends in the NovemberDecember period while predicting a yearend rally for stocks Recent economic data has remained resilient and Q3 earnings are unlikely to rock the boat With the Fed virtually on pause now equity markets can embark on a run higher to close out 2023Last Friday SPY closed right under its 200DMA support level and the trendline of support from October 2022 lows However we could be forming a bear trap here with RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart showing signs of positive divergenceFrom a sentiment perspective investors appear to be fearful at this moment in time as indicated by CNNs Fear  Greed Index currently in Fear territoryAhead of a seasonally strong period in a preelection year investor sentiment is bearish fearful whilst SPY is nearly oversold and trading within a critical support zone From an ultra nearterm perspective SPY can forge some sort of a bounce here as long as we hold the 410 to 420 support zone and then resume the downtrend in H1 2024The immutable laws of money dictate that risk assets such as equities offer a positive risk premium relative to the riskfree rate in the market With the long end of the treasury yield curve having moved up to 5 in recent weeks the SP500 trading at a 4 earnings yield is simply unsustainable and a derating to 78 earnings yields would be justifiedGiven the current state of the economy and Fed chair Powells recent talk longduration treasury yields are likely to move higher from here not lower From a valuation and technical perspective the SP500 can drop by 2550 from current levelsAs we noted in this article there are uncanny similarities between 1987 and 2023 up to this point of the year Will we see a 1987esque crash Frankly I dont know but under the given set of economic and financial conditions I simply cannot rule out a stock market crashWinston Churchill once said Heading into a potential recession the equity market SP500 valuation reflects a high degree of investor complacency A 1987esque may or may not materialize however prudent investors must prepare themselves for a wide range of possible outcomes tail events in this uncertain environment Considering the simple yield math behind stock valuations the SP500 is ripe for a significant correction A technical bounce here may delay the inevitable move lower however looking at mediumterm 13 years riskreward I rate SPY a Sell at current levelsThe era of free money is over and we are now operating in a normalized interest rate environment With major US equity indices yet to price in the new financial realities the risk of significant correction or crash remains

211,A Rising Interest Rate Freight Train Is Coming For The Economy,The quiet murmur of rising interest rates has now grown to the roar of an approaching freight train The 10year yield continues to rise hitting a fresh 52week high this week over 43 The  this week and is now threatening to rise above 8 After over a decade of zerointerest rate central bank policies aka  surging inflation sparked an economic avalanche that threatens to turn the economy and markets as we know it upside down With massive government deficits analysts cant seem to raise their targetsSo why are interest rates rising so much And what does it mean for the economy and financial markets Lets dig inThe 2010s were a unique time in economic history Due to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis global central banks kept interest rates at zero or less for roughly 14 years The US raised interest rates for a couple of years from 2017 to 2019 but ended up cutting them right back to zero due to COVID In addition central banks pursued  to push down interest rates on mortgages to below the free market rate This had even more effect on the economyHolding interest rates at or near zero had subtle but profound effects on the economy in the 2010sZIRP also made certain business models unusually profitable Friends of mine got rich by doing not much more than borrowing money cheaply and buying real estate Decent execution of offtheshelf business models like  or Airbnb hosting made making money a cakewalk Even simply buying a property for a 35 fixed mortgage in the 2010s and putting paint carpet and a tenant in it was good enough During this time vacant houses in California made about as much money from price appreciation just by existing as a typical household living there did by workingCrypto is another business model that took off because of ZIRP With the economic inputs of interest rates at zero inflation at 23 and government borrowing a bit unsustainable putting some of your money in another currency like Bitcoin  actually makes a ton of senseOf course the mainstream economic theory here is that by fixing prices for loans at an unnaturally low level the Fed was going to create shortages For example QE created an artificial housing shortage despite there being a  in the US than there was before the 2008 crash Still consumer price inflation was low and everything was fine at least until around 2019 And low rates were popular with the upper middle class who saw their home equity increase and their 401ks rise But like Americas obsession with offlabel Ozempic it was too good to be trueThe chaos of the pandemic brought these policies to a rapid end Inflation surging from 2 to nearly 10 annually shattered the publics trust in price stability The public started panic buying goods there were shortages of all kinds of necessary goods and services in the economy and alternatives to the US dollar became cocktail party conversation This more or less forced the Fed to act by raising interest rates and reversing its QE policies Had they not done anything inflation likely would have continued to rise as it did in the 1970sToday inflation is still significantly above target and public trust in the currency is still not fully restored The US government is running  and fewer and fewer investors are willing to buy government debt Fitch recently downgraded the USs credit rating due to an  and a lack of will to raise taxes After getting burned by inflation the market is hitting backTo this point the market has severely punished the prices of previously issued longterm bonds with low coupon rates Longterm Treasuries  have fallen off of a cliffThis is simple supply and demand The Treasury needs to sell trillions of dollars in bonds to cover its budget deficits and the market has not been keenly interested in buying them As long as government deficits go unchecked interest rates will continue to rise The socalled  from Beijing to Riyadh to New York are threatening to humble the US Treasury voting with their keyboards to stop financing unsustainable levels of spending Unless the Treasury either raises taxes or sharply cuts spending the freight train will not be stopped While its theoretically possible that the White House could force the Fed to print money to buy the US debt this would send an unmistakable message to our foreign creditors that its time to turn off the spigot Longterm bonds actually arent a terrible value here if you trust the governments ability to raise taxes and maintain 2 inflation but that would require some sort of signal that theyre going to take deficits seriously firstEssentially credit is getting more expensive and harder to get Since household savings rates are near record lows thats a big problem for borrowers By industryAt a  a homebuyer with 100000 in income can qualify for a home worth 721000 At 4 its 649000 At 5 its 587000 At 6 its 533000 At 7 its 486000 At 8 its 445000 Finally at 9 mortgage rates a household with 100000 in income can qualify for a home that costs 410000 which is 43 less than they could at the 3 interest rate This is purely mechanical from the change in financing costs not due to opinion or sentiment To maintain equilibrium at 9 mortgage rates home prices would need to fall 43This isnt just theoretical Mortgage rates have already soared from 3 to 75 so 9 isnt even that crazy given where we already are This interest sits on top of large home price increases during the pandemic The typical household looking to buy a house now with a mortgage is making an almost existential choice by signing up to pay bubble prices at 78 interest Its not going to end well and DTI ratios are at or above their previous peaks in 20062007 If youre in the top 1 of income earners then do whatever you want but if youre looking to buy a house and start a family youre making a much bigger gamble than you might thinkIts going to be hard for interest rates to go down with the deficits the government is running so the most likely outcome here is some sort of housing crisis sooner rather than later Its not really a question of if its rather a question of when Consumers are not displaying enough elasticity to interest rates due to their bias against renting and its going to cost them Just because you should call an allin bet for 20 does not mean you should call it for 2000 Its the same with mortgages housing was a great investment at 2016 prices and 2016 interest rates but a terrible one at todays rates and pricesThe story isnt too different for automakers Because the vast majority of buyers need to finance their cars sharply rising interest rates are bad news for automakers While manufacturers are free to offer discounted financing it cuts into their margins Far fewer people can pay 90000 for a truck at 6 or 7 for a 5year loan than could at 2 or 3Marchs bank crisis was sparked by regional banks taking too much interest rate risk and then rising rates burned them Now rates are back at fresh 52week highs Where are all of these banks now and how much in losses have they sustained The crisis caused rates to fall allowing smart banks to get out from upsidedown bets For every bank that took decisive action to reduce interest rate exposure this spring there are likely several that put their heads in the sand While big banks are fine I expect dozens more of these smaller banks to end up being taken over cheaply by competitors or closed by the FDIC over the next 1218 months Bad bets on commercial real estate and longduration assets virtually guarantee this This will not be the last you hear about regional banksThis said attrition in the banking industry could be an opportunity for wellrun banks like JPMorgan The days of losing billions to grab market share are effectively over now that capital has a price While the 2010s brought gains in innovation they also brought hundreds of VCbacked companies with flimsy business models Expect many of these companies to go out of business over the next 1218 months This is just common senseLargecap valuations are nearbubble highs despite bond yields rapidly rising With the economy being revolutionized by skyrocketing interest rates its worth considering whether you can meet your financial goals by taking less risk in bonds and cash For every cloud there is a silver lining and bad news for borrowers is good news for lendersAlso its not widely known but interest rates are priced into futures and options which means that calls and long futures get more expensive while puts and short futures get cheaper Higher interest rates also accrue to short sellers who short stock enforcing some discipline on the market by channeling capital away from junk companies to higherquality profitable companiesCurrent valuations for large stocks are suspect The SP 500  currently sits at  in terms of its earnings Stocks like Apple  and Microsoft  are trading for 30x earnings or more while stocks like Tesla  Amazon  and Nvidia  are trading for 50100x Historically these kinds of valuations dont work out On the other hand you can get roughly 55 in money market funds  55 in shortterm bonds  and 44 taxfree in municipal bonds  Will stocks ever get cheaper than they are now Since stocks have almost never been more expensive than they are now from a valuation perspective it seems likely that theyll revert to the mean with bonds and cash offering better and better returns Again I think this happens sooner rather than later in various countries tells us that higher rates and inflation will likely remain for 510 years While a severe recession could bring balance back to the economy this is hard to exploit because the assets that would benefit from lower rates stocks real estate would likely have to get completely crushed first to set the conditions for another bull market from the bottomWhile realtors are shouting from the rooftops to get buyers to date the rate and marry the house overpaying for assets with teaser rates and betting that interest rates will go down and make the deal pencil is something that has burned millions of people in the past This time is likely no different History also shows that  tend to go up in times of economic stressThis also goes for the popular assertion that the economy will never slow down because unemployment is currently low Consumption of food services and soft goods wont crash per se due to higher interest rates but the borrowing to buy stuff will crash Housing and autos  for consumers and changes in these are how every business cycle starts and ends Workers in these industries are the original source of unemployment shocks and business investment operates on a similar cycle This eventually trickles down to consumption but its a slow process Student loans kicking back in on October 1st  as student loan debt service is about 1 of the US national aftertax incomeYou should care about rising interest rates because it greatly affects the fair value of assets If you understand how interest rates affect asset pricing you can be more elastic to changes in interest rates and use this to make money for yourself and reduce your risk If youre overly emotional or dogmatic youre more likely to end up paying the wrong prices for the wrong assets To this point rising rates are both a huge opportunity and a huge threat to investors In a less dysfunctional world interest rates should not have risen this much and government budget deficits wouldnt be as atrocious But we have to make do with the world we have so this is how I view things as likely to play out going forwardWill interest rates continue to rise If so what will the effects be on the economy Share your thoughts in the comments below   Past

212,Is There Still A Bull Case For Bonds?,For those who have been bullish bonds and calling for a rally throughout 2023 it has been on the back of falling growth and waning inflation such thesisIt seems the traditional relationship between yields and the business cycle has broken down at least for nowIndeed while my own fixed income asset allocation quadrant has been suggesting an overweight position in duration is appropriate for this stage of the business cycle this cycle has thus far indeedBut to be fair market internals have also been disconfirming the recent highs in yields as indicators by the likes of the copper to gold ratio and the relative performance of cyclical stocks vs defensive stocks which are both contributors to this model have been making lower highs and lower lows while yields do the opposite Historically market internals have provided a fairly reliable gauge of where yields should be from a growth and inflation perspectiveHowever while growth has been slowing on the whole the US economy remains robust and resilient meaning the business cycle overall hasnt actually been an allout tailwind for bonds just yetDespite the plethora of unfavourable leading indicators of economic growth the US economy continues to hold steady Much of this resilience can be attributed to a combination of the followingAnd although we have clearly seen a slowdown and probably recession in the cyclical manufacturing side of the economy the services sector is humming along nicely We can observe this below by examining the recent momentum in a number of key economic data points Outside of industrial production growth in consumption income and employment all remain in expansionary territoryWhile the trend in growth is by and large to the downside the economy overall has been running pretty hot and the expectation we are heading into recession which is driving many fund managers to allocate to duration has simply not yet played outBut I say that to say this A recession may well be on the cards yet As I detailed in my recent  the evidence continues to point to a slowdown in growth over the coming quarters which should translate into hard data deterioration at some point in late 2023 or early 2024 This is an outcome that should favour duration at some point in this cycle but we are not there yetOf course from a fundamental perspective for bonds growth is only half the story Inflation and inflation expectations also play a major role in determining the price of interest Unlike the growth story the deceleration in inflation has been much more clear cut Headline CPI has moved sharply lower this year The latest threemonth annualised reading came in at 19 just shy of the Feds 2 targetOf course core CPI has been far stickier as a result of persistent wage growth but the outlook for owners equivalent rent the largest component of both headline and core CPI suggests the overall trend in core CPI is likely to be to the downside over the next 12 monthsHowever I would argue the downtrend in headline inflation looks to be running out of steam Indeed as I detailed  we could well be nearing a point in which many of the cyclical drivers of headline CPI  energy food and commodities overall  are shifting from inflation headwinds to tailwinds once again This is certainly a message being corroborated by my composite inflation leading indicator whose downside momentum clearly looks to be waning and is not suggesting headline CPI reaches the Feds 2 yearoveryear growth target anytime soonOf course whether we do see renewed inflationary pressures show up in headline CPI as 2023 progresses depends much on how far energy prices can rally in the coming months While I do not think we will see tripledigit oil prices this year the fundamentals within the oil market continue to lead toward the bullish side of the spectrum as I detailed I would not at all be surprised to see 90100 oil in the coming months an outcome which would once again put increased upside pressure on inflation breakevens which themselves are highly correlated to the oil price as we can see below and thus put upside pressure on interest rates overallThe positioning dynamics of the bond market have become rather tricky to decipher in recent times Bond bulls have been quick to highlight how bearish speculative positioning is towards the bond market which is currently nearing multidecade lowsWhile speculative positioning is indeed at its most bearish levels in decades a signal which I would generally lend a great deal of credence in this case it would be remiss of me if I were not to point out the large potential fault in the signaling power of this data pointThis relates to the  a popular trading strategy deployed by relative value hedge funds Such a strategy attempts to profit from dislocations between the pricing of cash Treasuries and that of Treasury futures During periods when there is demand for Treasury futures from institutional asset managers such as pension funds which seems to be the case at present as I shall detail below then this increased demand can create a dislocation between the price of the underlying itself and that of Treasury futures This creates an opportunity for hedge funds to lever up in the repo market and buy the underlying while at the same time shorting the futures attempting to capture the spread This was a popular investment strategy prior to COVID19 and we can see these strategies are seemingly once again being deployed by hedge funds by looking at measure such as hedge funds futures positioning which is heavily short as we can see above Treasury repo volumes which have soared to multiyear highs as well as asset manager positioning in the futures market which is heavily long The Fed itself also recently  how such strategies are seemingly being utilised by hedge funds once againNot only does this dynamic suggest institutional capital in the form of pension funds and the like are long bonds but it also seems to suggest the heavily short speculative positioning in the futures market illustrated above may be somewhat misleading and not actually providing a reliable contrarian buy signal after allIf we assess discretionary positioning toward bonds through the lens of Bank of Americas Global Fund Manager Survey we can see that not only are asset managers heavily overweight bonds but there is also a consensus among them that yields are going to fall from here Previous instances where discretionary managers were as certain yields were going to fall marked major tops in bonds not bottomsAlso confirming this level of bullish sentiment toward long duration is JP Morgans client survey indexUnlike what speculative positioning in the futures market is indicating it appears asset allocations and money managers are actually bullish bondsOther measures of positioning are also sending similar messages The putcall ratio for the 10year Treasury bond for example remains floored and is not signalling the kind of panic put buying indicative of market bottomsIn fact as we can see below just the opposite has occurred Call buying on the TLT ETF has skyrocketed in recent monthsMeanwhile TLT fund flows have been positive for much of 2022 and 2023 as investors pile into the traditional recession trade while the ETFs short interest is effectively nonexistent relative to historical levelsAgain this is the kind of speculative behaviour generally seen at market tops not bottoms Undoubtedly it appears everyone one is playing the deflationary cyclical game of the last 30 years without understanding the changing structural dynamics surrounding inflation and demand and supply  nowhere is this more evident that in the bond market term premium more on this laterAlas one group of traders we can be sure are actually short bonds and are providing some kind of reliable contrarian buy signal are CTAs which are effectively systematic trendfollowing strategies While not as short bonds as they have been CTAs are indeed actually short the market and as we can see below courtesy of Goldman Sachs there is plenty of juice CTAs can provide bonds should a short squeeze develop at some stageIt is also worth noting too how pessimistic the media has become toward bonds While discretionary positioning does not yet reflect this narrative this level of bearish sentiment in mainstream media is often noteworthySo if inflation has been falling and fund managers buying bonds why do yields continue to go up Simply put this is a supply and demand storyIndeed I have highlighted in previous articles on the bond market how unfavourable the supply and demand dynamics could be for yields but I must admit this bearish force has been far greater than I had anticipated Unfortunately this is unlikely to change anytime soonThough most will be aware of the fiscal situation the United States currently finds itself in from a Treasury issuance perspective it is worth repeating Since running down the Treasury General Account earlier this year the US Treasury has been issuing new debt en masse with around 1 trillion of Treasuries forecast to be issued in Q3 and Q4 of this year alone Thats a lot of supplyOf course this is happening at a time when Federal tax receipts are falling and interest expenses rising two trends which will only exacerbate this dynamic and worsen the fiscal situationMeanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to undertake QT and dump additional supply on the market while foreign investors are themselves also no longer funding US deficits on net and havent been for some years now As such it is falling to the private sector to buy these bondsAnd while the private sector has been happy to comply thus far given the attractiveness of US government debt it is true that when neither the Fed nor foreign investors are willing to provide the required level of demand in the absence of demand supply sets the price Per the work of Totem Macro below what this means is historically excess supply has had a far more meaningful impact on pressuring yields higher than would be the case when the Fed was willing to support the market via QE and foreign investors were willing to finance US deficitsThese excess supply dynamics remain a continued threat to the bond market But it unfortunately doesnt end thereJapanese investors are the largest foreign owners of US Treasury securities Japanese insurance companies and pension funds represent some of the largest pools of capital in the world and US bonds are one of their primary holdings So when the Bank of Japan makes alterations to its yield curve control policy this can have big implications for Japanese capital flowsIndeed they have recently done just that widening the 10year JGB trading band from 50 bps to 100 bps And as noted recently by the  with yields going up in Japan the risk is that Japanese investors will now begin to sell US fixed income and start buying higheryielding Japanese fixed income This is a big deal for global fixed income markets because Japanese investors are the biggest foreign holders of US Treasuries and they also own significant amounts of US creditWe can see this dynamic in play by looking at the correlation of 10year US Treasury yields and 10year Japanese government bond yields As JBG yields rise Japanese capital allocators are incentivised to sell foreign USTs and buy domestic bondsThe depreciation of the yen relative to the USD also exacerbates this dynamic as many Japanese investors hedge their FX exposure when investing in foreign debt assets So when the dollaryen FX rate rises USD appreciates relative to the yen hedging costs increase and domestic yields can become more attractive even if the yields are lower than UST yields This dynamic helps to explain why the USDJPY FX rate black line below is so closely correlated to US yields blue line belowThis dynamic is perhaps better illustrated by comparing JGB yields relative to FXhedged UST yields as we can see below The additional yield pickup for Japanese investors when investing in USTs is much lower than the JGB yield when accounting for the hedging costs associated with foreign investmentThis is the threat of the great repatriation of foreign capital All else equal rising JGB yields and a strong dollar incentivises Japanese investors to repatriate capital to finance Japanese deficits instead of US deficits a dynamic which will only serve to further reduce demand for US government debt securities at least at current ratesBut once again the story doesnt end there Another spike in oil and energy costs could again result in capital flows from energy importers out of USTs and into domestic assets in order to defend their currencies  as rising energy costs lowers current account balances thus depreciating the currency  another risk to duration should energy costs ie oil start to rise again Such flows are effectively equal to additional QTShould the USD strengthen this also gives reason for foreigners to continue to sell USTs to strengthen their own currencies as the dollar trends to go up when Fed is conducting QT and the private sector must adsorb the debt while the foreign sector is selling The recent devaluation of the Chinese yuan speaks to this risk with  recently reporting that Chinese banks are trying to defend the CNY by selling USDsUSTsAs we can see the supply and demand imbalance clearly indicates their remains upside risk for yields and downside risk for bonds regardless of the macro fundamentals for duration These are very important factors at play that have not been anywhere near as prominent in recent times where the fundamentals favoured durationFrom a technical perspective the 10year yield is at an interest juncture After butting heads with recent resistance just shy of 44 and completing a daily 9139 DeMark sell signal this recent move higher in yields clearly looks to be running out of steam Given the level of bearish media sentiment toward bonds at present I suspect we will see this correction continue to play out over the next month or two though I would be surprised if yields were to retrace all the way down to their major support level around 34 anytime in the near future Indeed barring any imminent crash in equities recession or market event that sees the return of QE it is hard to argue against this being a chart that looks like it wants to go higher overallWhile what I have discussed thus far has primarily focused on the cyclical outlook for bonds it is worth highlighting some of the secular risks for the bond market that could see yields move much higher over the medium to long termThis dynamic is most aptly examined through the lens of the term premium which represents the additional compensation investors receive for holding a longer dated bond ie 10year Treasury until maturity as opposed to continually investing in one year Treasuries and reinvesting the proceeds each year upon maturity In theory the term premium should account for the additional duration and inflation risks associated with locking up capital for a long period of timeAs it stands it appears the term premium for 10year Treasuries is not at all reflecting any kind of structural risks facing markets  of the term premium suggest it is still negative as investors are yet to demand any kind of meaningful compensation for actually bearing the additional risks for being long duration in a world of We can see this below by comparing the term premium to various forms of longterm inflation expectationsThe same can be said of inflation uncertainty which has clearly yet to be accounted for by fixed income tradersEven the outlook for debt issuance by the US Treasury and the excess supply this is set to bring to the market are yet to be fully accounted for in the term premiumOn a structural level it seems clear there are a number of reasons why yields could go higher from here or at least average a higher level that what we have seen during recent decades These are dynamics all bond bulls should keep in mindSumming it all up there are clearly a very large number of factors at play here that are contributing or attempting to contribute to the movement in bond prices and yields The economic resilience thus far has resulted in any kind of material growth slowdown or recession being pushed back meaning the macro conditions are yet to turn truly favourable for bonds Likewise while the cyclical inflation trend has been to the downside for most of the past 12 months there are signs suggesting inflationary pressures could again reemerge as we close out 2023Meanwhile the supply and demand story for bonds remains as bearish as ever with excess issuance by the US Treasury and the potential for the repatriation of foreign capital both serious risks that could lead to higher yieldsWill we get a cyclical bond rally at some stage Most probably but the timing here is very difficult given the bearish factors in play A significant rally in bonds will probably require a material stock market crash recession or the resumption of QE This is particularly true given how discretionary positioning toward the asset class seems on the bullish side For now being long duration at present is not the right riskreward trade investors should be looking for particularly given the attractive yields on offer from the short end of the curve After all we now live in a world where you can be paid to wait The summary bullets for this article were

213,TLT: Bullish Ahead Of September Payrolls And The CPI Update,Rising bond yields have taken the market by storm with the 10year and 30year Treasury rate at the highest levels since 2007 approaching nearly 5 The setup has been a disaster for the bond market including the iShares 20 Year Treasury BondThe fund technically tracks a basket of Treasury bonds with maturities greater than  and represents a good bond benchmark as one of the most widely traded exchangetraded funds in the market While the trading action has been poor we see room to take the other side ahead of a reboundThe potential for favorable indicators between the September CPI as well as the payrolls report suggesting confidence that inflation will continue to trend lower could help build a consensus that the Fed is done withThe Feds rate hiking policy in place since early last year taking the Fed Funds rate from effectively zero to 55 at the short end of the curve explains much of the dynamic in rising yields at the long end of the curveStill what were seeing now has evolved into more of a momentumbased selloff Data shows that bond futures market positioning is at a implying a bet on even higher yields going forwardAs it relates to the macro backdrop the interpretation is a view by some that inflation remains a problem and the Fed will need to keep hiking to bring the CPI down to the 2 target levelThis line of thinking received some fodder at the September Fed meeting with comments by Chairman Powell leaving the door open for another rate hike this year noting the group remains datadependentThe higher for longer mantra was strengthened by the fabled dot plot forecast by Fed members for the Fed Funds rates in 2024 to 51 compared to 46 from the June updateAll in all it is fair to say bonds deserve to be higher compared to levels last year although we will argue that the move has been overextendedThe key point here is that there is some uncertainty regarding the actual direction of Fed policy even over the next few months The difference between a continued pause or a rate hike over the next Fed meetings has significant implications for the broader bond marketImportantly that extra rate hike taking the Fed Fund Rates to 575 is far from certain with a case to be made that it wont happen There is a deep divide in the market right now regarding where the Fed Funds rate will end this yearAccording to the which extrapolates the probability for the Fed Funds rate move at each FOMC there is currently a 522 chance the Fed ends the year at the December meeting with no change to the current 55 level compared to a 478 odds for a hikeThe point here is to recognize that the interest rate expectations and the corresponding market probabilities are dynamic Several factors can work to shift those probabilitiesA good or favorable data point suggesting lowerthanexpected inflationary pressures between now and the next Fed meeting could be enough to keep the group on hold If it becomes clear further rate hikes are unnecessary for the CPI to trend lower this scenario would be particularly bullish for bonds and TLT with room for yields to correct lowerThis would be reflected in the December rate hike odds repricing lower and potentially even pulling forward the room for a rate cut earlier in 2024 This would also be a positive for stocks although well leave that to a separate discussionOn the other hand bond bears are sort of hoping inflation surprises much higher with other macro data coming in exceptionally strong forcing the Fed to turn even more hawkish Here is the marketimplied probability that a rate hike in December would become the consensus as a further tailwind for bond yields to climb higher and more downside in bond prices including the TLT ETFTwo major indicators are coming out over the next few weeks that can help set the record straight First up is the September nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday October 6th The current consensus is for 170k jobs added representing a slight slowdown from 187k in AugustOur thinking here is that this otherwise soft figure confirms a gradual deceleration in the labor market as evidence monetary policy is working to cool demandside consumer pricing pressures For context the average number of jobs added over the past year has been around 260k added per month meaning its clear that the pace has slowedWhat might even be more encouraging is room for the unemployment rate to climb above 4 based on a growing participation rate that was the theme in AugustThis headline number returned to the highest level since 2021 indicating that the transmission of monetary policy to restrict economic activity within the credit cycle is working We also expect wage growth to be subduedIn our view it would take a blowout print higher implying the economy is exceptionally strong to raise an eyebrow at the Fed that the labor market trends are inflationaryA miss to the downside on Friday with the payroll number a bit weaker than expected would be a very bullish backdrop for bonds because it pushes back on the need for the Fed to keep hiking and brushes aside concerns that inflation is acceleratingIf anything bonds could react in a sort of buy the news dynamic where any print is met with some marketwide short covering considering the recent weakness We expect to see a rally in TLT here as part of a short squeeze dynamic against the excessive net short interest in the bond marketTLT bulls can also look forward to the September CPI report set to be released on October 12th A lot of attention has been placed on the recent spike in oil prices although the key here will be core trends The September inflation update showed that the core CPI dropped to 43 the lowest level in more than two yearsThis is a very favorable development we expect to continue over the next few months because this side of the consumer price basket covers categories like housing automobiles and services that are more directly impacted by higher interest rates compared to energy pricesAll indications are that core CPI which had been stubbornly elevated for much of the past year is finally turning The Fed looks at three and sixmonth annualized levels which are well on their way to being at the target range Again the data has said they are datadependent and the cooling CPI is as important as it gets to confirm the trend is on trackIn terms of the headline rate our call is that core can drag the broader index lower through 2024 Even as oil prices have climbed we believe it would take oil significantly higher for it to begin driving a costpull inflationary wave We can point to retail gasoline which remains as a national average as highlighted by the otherwise muted impact on the consumer price basketPutting it all together we see good value in bonds at the current level with room for TLT to rebound higher as interest rates stabilize and ultimately pull backInvestors can pick up TLT with a compelling 4 dividend yield on a forward basis with a good chance the fund will deliver a positive total return over the next year in our opinion A scenario where the 30year Treasury rate corrects to 425 by yearend implies TLT can reclaim the 100 as our initial targetInto 2024 the possibility that the inflation converges toward the 2 target more quickly than currently expected would provide the flexibility for the Fed to consider rate cuts based on anchored expectations This could evolve irrespective of economic conditions within the soft landing scenario where the economy averts a recessionA soft September payroll report and cool CPI can go a long way to reset the trajectory of Fed policy TLT and bond market shorts covering within a broader repricing would kickstart a momentum trade to the upsideIn terms of risks it would be more a concerning spike or reaccelerating of inflationary pressures that would be necessary to sustain a selloff in bonds Factors such as the national debt with supply and demand dynamics of Treasury bond issuances also play a role in this market but to a lesser extentThe setup here is that bonds are oversold and the next move in prices is higher in our opinion More aggressive traders can also consider the ProShares Ultra 20 Year Treasury ETF  which is essentially a 2x leveraged version of TLT

214,Canadian Solar: EPS Outlook Plummeting On Solar Glut And China Risks,2023 has been a particularly challenging year for the solar industry The solar ETF  has lost 40 of its value this year with virtually all those losses occurring over the past three months One notable exampleOver the past month alone CSIQ has plummeted by 20 due to a poor sales outlook and earnings report from its larger competitor SolarEdge  Further although solar stocks have lostCanadian Solar has been a publicly traded company since 2007 Since then it has gone through four boom and bust cycles where it doubled or more in value and erased all those gains The same pattern is mirrored in most other solar stocks In general the boom and bust cycle is correlated to changes in CSIQs EPS however there is a tremendous amount of speculative influence considering there is often some overreaction in the stock price in either direction See belowOne key issue with solar companies is that the industry is not as firmly rooted as others in the energy space These companies are very capitalintensive with Canadian Solar spending over 630B in CapEx last year or nearly half of its current market capitalization Accordingly they operate with a fair degree of competition and are highly exposed to broader manufacturing trendsMany investors are attracted to solar companies because they see the longterm growth potential of the solar market However the greatest benefactors of that may not be the solar panel factories because theyre exposed to the same competitive interest rate and inflation risks as all other industrial manufacturers A slight decline in demand combined with a continued increase in global solar panel production can quickly push the market into a glut erasing the relatively thin profit margins found by factories Additionally these companies do not naturally grow organically as many others but require significant capital infusions to expand Thus substantial sales growth will almost always require considerable equity dilution or debt financingThe operating margin and sales growth trends of Canadian Solar and its peer Solar Edge are very similar because they compete in the same market See belowThe operating margins of these firms dipped dramatically from 20202022 mainly due to supplychain challenges that increased production costs while  to slow Today are up dramatically as these companies adjust for rising costs although theyre still lower than many years ago That said the price hike is likely sufficient to lower demand particularly considering that electricity price growth has stagnated after two strong years Thus the sales outlooks for these firms are now deteriorating more quicklyCanadian Solar is still expected to expand its revenue over the coming years However over the past year there has been a significant decline in its immediate and longerterm revenue estimates highlighting some potential for stagnation See belowSignificantly Canadian Solar relies on debt financing to grow its revenue which comes at the cost of its equity stability It has also diluted its equity to a small extent over recent years though the pace has quickened Further we can expect that production costs such as power labor and input materials will continue to increase at or above inflation as in recent years As a result its  to stagnate through at least 2025 but no significant declines are anticipated with annualized EPS running around 5 and potentially rising after 2025The solar sectors largest issues are interest rates and inflation Combined these factors dramatically increase solar installation costs and lower most solar systems ROI Solar panel loans now carry  APRs erasing most of the gains received by adopting the panels Problematically the solar market has not been tested by such high interest rates ever before increasing the probability of overestimation as recently seen in guidance cutAt the same time the production of solar panels particularly from China is rising very quickly today In light of waning demand this situation has already created a glut of solar modules in many markets with that  as long as US and EU interest rates constrain residential demand and corporate Combined with increasing weakness in  credit ratings and rising solar panel production costs I believe it may take longer than 2025 before we see a rebound in solar demand  very cheap today likely reversing some of the electricity price growth since 2020Most of the companys manufacturing is in China often viewed as a Chinese headquartered in Canada At the end of 2022 72 of its longlived assets 167B in total were situated in China an additional 12 were in Thailand but less than 1 were in Canada see  Its annual report has 315 mentions of China and 365 of PRC with immense details regarding associated risks relating to trade ownership issues geopolitical risks taxation and other factors Additionally 95 is in Asia while just 3 is in CanadaCanadian Solar markets itself as a Canadian firm which is technically accurate but its core operations are mainly Chinese China is essentially the only place in the world where solar panels can be manufactured costeffectively due to other countries environmental and labor cost restrictions Controversially Canadian Solar has  of using Uyghurs in China Unfortunately The same is true for many Chinesemade items however unlike  Canadian Solar cannot hide behind the issue through externally contracted factories since they indirectly own projects in Xinjiang Although the company has since investigated the issue and  thirdparty that is not entirely accurateHumanitarian issues aside this controversy is a significant problem for CSIQ For one investors must realize that it is effectively a Chinese company that actively seeks to appear more Canadian than it truly is That is not to say that it is dishonest since its annual reports are clear on that fact but it is true in investor marketing since very few other analysts have realized this fact Of course the US and other countries recently against solar panel imports made by Chinas forced labor factories Aside from the slave labor issue it is a problem that most of CSIQs assets are tied up in China because US investors do not necessarily own those assets instead being indirectly that generally do not protect foreign investorsIn my view in light of Solar Edges substantial guidance cut the latest income and sales estimates for Canadian Solar are likely overestimated Interest rates are now around 5 from today through 30year Treasury bonds so there is no reason to expect any reductions in shortterm borrowing costs anytime soon Considering we see the yield curve steepen without rate cuts it is possible that the Federal Reserve may hike rates again next year Inflation has slowed but it can rebound as it had numerous  which faced similar supplyside inflationary trends relating to geopolitics in the Middle EastThat risk factor compounds Canadian Solars woes because its COGS should now rise faster than its sales consistently as long as interest rates and inflation remain an issue In my view we may likely see the companys operating margins slip back toward zero as they had been years ago Higher interest rates also push the companys borrowing costs up just as its debt grows as it seeks to expand its operations The companys financial debttoEBITDA is relatively high at 6X particularly considering I expect its EBITDA to crash due to the sales and profit margin reversal Indeed considering its thin margins and high capital overhead I believe there is reasonable potential that CSIQs EPS will be back around zero by the end of 2024 far below current estimatesShort interest on CSIQ is high at 96 meaning many investors are betting against the stock Most analysts love the company and believe it is undervalued today but may be dramatically underappreciating its Chinarelated risk factors and broader glut risks facing the solar sector As solar loan costs soar and solar panel production costs rise with global labor and commodities I firmly believe Canadian Solar and most of its peers will soon see enough price competition that their meager operating margins will be wiped out again Weve seen this pattern many times throughout the companys history so I do not see any strong reason to suspect it should not continueThe fact is that Canadian Solar is not a green energy growth company but a relatively oldschool manufacturing firm with tremendous cyclical risks and capital needs Further it faces high exposure to geopolitical trade issues between the West and China and associated labor issue allegations This is not to say that I do not believe Solar itself will grow just that Canadian Solar as a stock has minimal upside potential related to the longterm expansion of the solar industry So long as supply and demand rise together a factory will not generally expand its income without raising external capital Thus CSIQs sustained EPS upside even with a great demand outlook for Solar is minimal to me while its downside risk associated with a glut is considerableOverall I am slightly bearish on CSIQ today and believe it will continue to lose value over the coming months as its 20242025 EPS expectations decline due to the glut issue If the allegations of labor issues in China result in actions from Western governments then CSIQs downside would be even more significant That said the same can be said for most solar companies given that essentially all solar panels are produced in Asia  Personally while the US has made laws to stop the labor issue enforcement is  potentially because green necessarily afford higher pricesAt this point it is difficult to say where exactly CSIQ may land once its bearish trend ends It is just now reaching back into its preCOVID price range mirroring expectations of EPS deterioration To me given a nearorbelow zero operating margin outlook high leverage and Chinaheadquartered assets I would not personally buy CSIQ at any price given there is too much room for blackswan risk factors and financial deterioration However I would be surprised to see CSIQ cross below 1015 per share anytime soon given it did earn substantial profits over the past year Even if its prospects are in sharp reversal it is unclear if this issue will last until 20242025 or longer Thus while I am bearish I would not short CSIQ today because it has already lost so much value and we will likely not know clearly how its financial position will be impacted by the macroeconomic shift until early 2024

215,"Nvidia Was Up 235% In 2023, Don't Expect It To Continue (Rating Downgrade)",It is our stance that the stock market is not logical rather its sentimental There is no logical explanation for a stock to go up 100   only to fall 40  in aThis roller coaster ride is most evident in tech stocks which happens to be our specialty Therefore we openly and frequently discuss with our free newsletter readers the importance of layering into a leading position setting up buy plans ahead of time and also the importance of taking gains once the technicalWeve had unwavering conviction in Nvidias AI story  In fact it was our leading position going into 2023 and  exceeded Stanley Druckenmiller at 29 meanwhile Druckenmiller was celebrated for having a leading AI portfolio The Street is also  for being early to   which was a latecomer recommendation in March 2023 Ark Invest often discusses AI as a leading trend yet almost  entirely We point this out because we provided Nvidia as a stock tip for free repeatedly with toptier analysis delivered on Seeking Alpha and through  with our own capital backing the researchWe are a strong proponent of offering quality information at the free level We offer toptier analysis every single week in our free newsletter   Unfortunately free information tends to come from those who are unproven and may not be very good investors at all while those with a proven track record keep trades close to their chestNot only do we actively manage every position we own and send realtime trade alerts but we discuss openly and frequently our thoughts along the way Our track record on Nvidia over the past 12 years looks like thisThe single biggest issue individual investors face is a lack of quality information that is   and comes with  around position sizing portfolio performance and how to handle selloffsIt is this last point that wed like to discuss with you today how to handle selloffs We were considered crazy for buying Nvidia in 2022 and we are considered crazy for trimming in 2023 Yet in what is rare transparency for the financial world we are sharing with you our plans with this leading portfolio positionOn August 28th we put out our price analysis on NVDA We offered two general scenarios that we see playing out which are still very much in play today Here is what we said back thenAlso in the last report we were looking for a breakout above 480 to signal that a low was in and we were heading toward our first overhead target around of 545 We did see a breakout but it failed to hold which was a warning of more volatility to come This coupled with some heavy distribution volume above the 440 price level had us decide to take more gains in Nvidia However we do not believe current prices are ideal for a longterm buy and hold mindset Patience will likely pay off in the long run So it will be up to each investor to decide if they want to take on the risk of potentially getting one more highFor us the reward is not worth the risk which is why we have decided to trim Our last buy at 410 in July is our last buy and we do not have any more buys planned until we see a resolution There are two other AIrelated stocks that we like better in the near term and when we enter these we will notify our premium members with realtime trade alertsThis remains my primary perspective as long as we hold the 340 support Below there and the top is likely inNvidia is a core holding of ours so we will likely never close the position as long as the story and tech trend remain intact However we do strongly believe in taking gains reducing risk and targeting lower levels for a better cost basis That being said we believe we are approaching one of these moments Even though we broke a key trendline today we expect a bounce to occur soon If this bounce is a corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels we will trim our position even moreThere has been an excessive level of insider selling by the CEO Jensen Huang So far he has sold over 110000000 worth of shares over the last 3 weeks Regarding insider activity there are many reasons insiders sell which may have nothing to do with the business However when you see the executives within a company like the CEO its worth paying attention to Since June weve seen about 175000000 worth of NVDA soldIn conclusion our broad market work suggests that a complex topping process is forming Many sectors and stocks have likely topped while some big tech names look like they have the potential for one more high into the end of the yearInsider activity and institutional selling point toward another high being less likely If we do get that second high our plan is to trim more Until the 340 support breaks NVDA still has the potential for that last swing higher Regardless we believe being patient will pay off for those looking to buy a great company at a great a price We are also being patient for when we add back to our position and feel its better to be defensive at the momentIf you own Nvidia stock or are looking to own NVDA we encourage you to attend our weekly premium webinars held every Thursday at 430 pm EST Next week we will discuss NVDA

216,Surge Battery Metals Is The Lithium Giant In Nevada That You Haven't Heard Of Yet,My email box and phone blew up last week with friends and family forwarding the big news of Lithium Americas   huge calderahosted lithium mine in northern Nevada HaveHowever as boring as Ive been blathering on about lithium mining stocks I couldnt be satisfied with being ahead of the curve on lithium in general After all lithium prices have declined precipitously from record highs so it has been a stockpickers market for lithium mining stocksBack to Lithium Americas Yes and yes I said but then I added a big new reveal Theres an earlystage lithium company Surge Battery Metals   that looks to be sitting on a lithium deposit that checks all the boxes that Thacker Pass does and is arguably better but it is trading at 110th the value or less This companys property is also in Nevada ranked the number one miningfriendly region in the world by the  Theyve drilled some remarkable holes judging by lithium content strike length and initial geology and metallurgy So remarkable that the Chairman of the company a respected figure in the world of lithium mining and finance a Director former Rio Tinto executive and geologist and the Chairman of another public lithium mining company that became a strategic investor American Lithium   all had a similar initial response Surprise intrigue and sometimes headshaking disbelief Chairman of   his companys approximate 10 stake in Surge Battery Metals beginning at 1134  Director  Source   Chairman  Source Im going to assume that readers are familiar with the lithium space Im not going to discuss the chemistry of lithiumion batteries and Ill expend little to no ink on the differences between the three general types of lithium mining hardrock brine and sedimentclay The reason Im going to skip all that for now is I want to get this article out rapidly because I think after last weeks big pullback after a breakneck run that Surge Battery Metals warrants a strong buy recommendation I am convinced of this opinion based on the current supply and demand picture my experience investing in lithium stocks and investing in general I think that Surge Battery Metals will be acquired for at least five times the current market capitalization in relatively short order I want this article to serve as a stake in the ground at this point in time so I get the intangible credit for having informed a wider audience about Surge Battery Metals hopefully to our mutual successOf course hope is not a reliable investing strategy In my long investing experience though simple comparative economics is quite reliable That is just taking one product company or resource project and measuring it against another more established and higher valued one and determining whether the former is undervalued based on the qualities of each project and the market capitalization of the companies being compared Ill do that with Surge Battery Metals Nevada North Lithium ProjectThe Nevada North Lithium Project NNLP is in Northeast Nevada in Elko County It now encompasses 725 mineral claims a total area of 2245 square miles and is open in multiple directions The expanded size model is over 85 times larger than just this past February 2023 based on the latest results of the drilling campaign soil samples and geophysicsWhat first caught my attention about Surges NNLP last November 2022 was the below map showing geologist Alan Morris areawide soil sample results across the original footprint of the project Stunningly the pinkpurple regions reflect lithium values  from 500 to 5120 parts per million ppmNot only are lithium readings at the surface like this extremely rare the whole economics of a project can get a huge boost if the surface readings are confirmed to run deep And they do as confirmed by a 2022 drilling campaign that posted the results belowAs you can see these results are extraordinary in terms of grade and strike length and rival the best results of claysediment hosted lithium anywhere in North America Some highlights are the over  in hole 5 beginning right at the surface and hole 7 which boasts So far during the current drilling campaign two holes assays have come back from the thirdparty lab and have produced the following resultsHere in NN2301 we have about   to Surge Battery Metals the shallow zone includes lithium content  which is apparently the highest ppm in Nevada ever confirmed by a labNN2302 continued to expand the size of the project to the northwest as an  and contained one layer of core length of About eight more holes have been drilled including the deepening of a few previously drilled holes upon further indications of additional highly prospective zones of lithium at lower levelsIf the Nevada North Lithium Project appears to be as significant in size grade ease of lithium extraction and level of impurities as Thacker Pass the NNLP should be valued the same as Thacker Pass If the NNLP proves to be of greater significance in the majority of these factors it should be valued higher than Thacker Pass This is the basic thesisHowever we certainly need to add a lot of points to Thacker Pass for its stage of operations including finalized permitting and approval finalized mining flow sheet and plan of operations defined metallurgy and financing Lithium Americas has been at this a long time and is clearing ground and commencing operations They are much farther along and there is a significant value attributed to project stage by the MarketOnce Lithium Americas finalizes its split into two entities one which holds the South American assets and the other which holds the North American assets we will know how the Market values Thacker Pass Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Jaberwock Research wrote a  with a valuation estimate on the separated entities They ascribe a value to Thacker Pass of 4009 Billion discounted by 7 excluding a 636 Million investment from GM of which half has been injected so far They give a value to the South American assets of 2354 Billion post cash of 167 Million and debt of 279 Million Because the Market is currently valuing the combined company at 272 Billion in Market Cap which is less than half of Jaberwocks discounted allin current value Ill use their ratio of 7030 in favor of Lithium Americas North American assets This comes to about 19 Billion for Thacker Pass in terms of current Market CapOn to the comparison Here is a table of the most important claysediment hosted lithium deposits in North AmericaFrom the table above we can see that Surges NNLP has higher average grades than even stellar Thacker Pass averaging 3437 from its drilling campaign thus farIn its initiation of coverage the analysts at SCP Resource Finance previously known as Sprott Capital Partners estimates based on last years drilling alone a resource of 253Mt LCE   They believe that this seasons just completed drilling could lift the resource towards  SCP further sees blue sky potential of the NNLP at Upcoming holes are being drilled deeper to up to 1000 feet and previously drilled holes are being deepened after indications of deeper targets 15Mt LCE could even be conservative in my opinion and well find out soon from the assays of these deeper targetsHow can one make an estimate like this with only the assays from 10 holes some will protest Fortunately the nature of clayhosted lithium deposits gives geologists confidence as clayhosted deposits often show remarkable consistency and continuity across a wide areaThacker Pass sits in the McDermitt Caldera an ancient lake inside that formed inside a collapsed volcano which collectedlithium enriched sediments from various geologic occurrences over millions of years  including of course the volcanos initial eruption  constrained by the volcanos edges Over time these sediments became further enriched with lithium as detailed in one of the papers principally authored by Lithium Americas Thomas Benson  that garnered a lot of welldeserved attention in the press recentlyThe high grades of Libearing clay being found at the NNLP are similar if not higher than the grades found at Thacker Pass and the regional rocks have been described as of  to the McDermitt Tuff soils that host lithium at Thacker Pass The NNLP sits in the site of the Jarbridge Caldera and it appears from the location and geology that the same factors that enriched the lithiumbearing clays at Thacker Pass could also be responsible for the NNLPs  of lithium ppmsFurther in the recent  with Surge director Iain Scarr he mentions that there is more Hectorite present in the soils of Thacker Pass than present at the NNLP hence extracting the lithium from NNLP should be less complicated and less costlySpeaking about soils the SCP analyst points to a beneficially low magnesium content 24 and the presence of coarse calcite crystals which aid in extractionpurification efficiencyAnother key factor in mining is overburden which is simply how much relatively worthless rock and dirt sit above the valuable resource that must be removed to get to the good stuff As mentioned above  Compare this to Thacker Pass which finds itself in the opposite position At Thacker Pass the best grades are generally  and the lesser grades are at the surface Overburden equals additional cost Surges project is blessed with high grade at the surface in the resource area drilled so farTo sum up the comparison Lithium Americas Thacker Pass mine is being valued in the Market right now at 19 Billion before the second 300 Million cash infusion from GM assuming the value of the entire company presplit is 70 in favor of Thacker Pass We will find out this week perhaps before this article comes out Regardless some Seeking Alpha contributors see a value of Thacker Pass of up to about 57 Billion excluding the 636 Million from GMLets be a bit conservative and give Thacker Pass a current value of 15 Billion Surge Battery Metals has a current market cap of about 109 Million US dollars and a fully diluted market cap of about 140 Million US dollarsThat is a  In doing this comparison I asked myself what the likelihood is that the NNLP becomes a mine Considering all of the positives and the comparison that at the very least gives the NNLP an equal value if it becomes a mine after it is proved out by the requisite amount of drilling I have no doubt that it does become a mine It will probably not be owned by the same corporation at that point as I can see Surge Battery Metals being acquired for a substantial premium in relatively short orderAfter all Lithium Americas reportedly had numerous competitors vying to take the stake that GM ended up winning The US Administration has recognized the urgency of a domestic supply of lithium and other critical energy metals and plenty of companies are finding out the hard way that some nations are looking to nationalize or further control lithium projects Case in point the Sonora Lithium project in Mexico The government of Mexico just  a number of concessions from Chinese giant  in a move that could delay another large source of lithium to a world that is estimated to be going into deficit for yearsWhen investing in the mining sector its often wise to bet on the repeat performers Their contacts geological experience and instincts come in especially handy in the relatively small community of lithium experts Its a small community because for a very long time lithium wasnt worth a whole lot How times have changedThe  of Surge Battery Metals is  an experienced executive and financier who sold his last company Millennial Lithium to none other than Lithium Americas for 490 Million USThe  of Surge is  who before Surge was EVP of Transmission and Distribution at British Columbias electric utility BC Hydro serving 4 Million customers He previously served as Deputy Minister of Energy Mines and Petroleum Resources and Chair of the BC Oil and Gas Commission is a geologist with more than 30 years at Rio Tinto including serving as Commercial Director and VP of Exploration holds a BSc in chemistry and a PhD in flotation technology A holder of numerous patents involving lithium processing and extraction Dr Mehta is a worldrenowned expert in lithium mining extraction and processing is EVP at American Lithium Corp and the board representative for American Lithiums investment in Surge Battery Metals He is a professional geoscientist and brings more than 30 years of experience in the exploration industry to the Company including working directly on American Lithiums TLC Claystone Project in NevadaHere is a rundown of Surges share structure from their most recent corporate deckThe Company raised about 7 Million dollars in June 2023 mostly from American Lithium which has funded their recent drilling and exploration campaign They reported about 96 Million on the  at the end of June Warrants attached to that financing should bring in some more money to the company if American Lithium chooses to increase its stake in Surge which I expect them to do Other financing will of course be necessary in the future for Surge to keep up the pace of drilling Considering Surges prospects and the attention coming to lithium in Nevada I think financing will not be a problem and could come from many sources including another strategic investorAs detailed previously Surge just concluded its second drilling campaign and has released results on two of them There are about eight yet to be released after they are analyzed at the lab including some that have been reentered with a rig that can handle greater depthsOther news could relate to additional land acquisitions additional strategic investors and perhaps additional site visits another global automaker which the CEO described after the initial drilling results were releasedThen the Maiden Resource Estimate MRE will be released estimated by the company variously to be arriving as early as November 2023 but at the latest Q1 2024 More recently company representatives have said that Q1 is more likely to allow the incorporation of the results of the whole second drilling campaignBelow is my own standard list of the main risks I consider specifically when considering an investment in junior mining stocks beyond the general risks inherent in any public company investmentWhat balances some of these standard risks in Surges case is Lithium Americas hardfought but trailblazing success They had rough patches along the way had court fights and doubters of the technology behind lithium extraction from claysediment but emerged successful and are rumored to be close to a  from the US government to fund mine constructionSurge is the beneficiary of the Second Mover Advantage By following Lithium Americas playbook where it was successful and avoiding the minefields where it had difficulties Surge could really expedite the timeline to a producing mine or a buyout Who better to guide the team than Chairman Graham Harris who led his companys buyout by Lithium Americas and CEO Greg Reimer who rapidly focused Surge on the NNLP and started to assemble a crack team when he saw what they had in the ground Chairman Harris has done this before and I was a beneficiary since I owned stock in Millennial LithiumOne final point concerns the price of batterygrade lithium Spot prices are volatile and reflect shortterm supply and demand considerations but most lithium is purchased on longterm contracts Some might think that currently depressed prices in the spot market are a sign of a surplus of lithium Maybe if viewed weektoweek but the longterm demand picture is extremely bullish and might even get desperate as countries increasingly look to protect their own national lithium interests cancel concessions and various mines get delayed or cancelled such as  in Serbia and Sonora in MexicoAnalysts at Macquarie have  that lithium supplies have been depleted now to the level where prices began to soar the last timeSometime in the near future but within a year I expect Surge Battery Metals to be acquired by one of the big names in lithium such as Rio Tinto Albermarle BHP Lithium Americas or even a specialty chemical conglomerate auto manufacturer or oil major There are a lot of contenders out there and if I think the operative word is  Surges official MRE confirms the highestgrade clayhosted resource in North America which has minimal overburden and favorable extraction parameters I predict Surges share price

217,"Yes, This September Nonfarm Payrolls Report Supports The Soft Landing Narrative",This mornings  came in whitehot at aboutThe market initially reacted with a sharp selloff and yields spiked By lunch hour what started looking like a vicious selloff turned into a nice rally complete with the SP VIX Index  falling 4 at 1227 pm and the Nasdaq and Russell both up north of 1 The expectations were for a soft report that showed a slowdown in hiring particularly after the private sector  came in at only 89000 earlier in the weekThere were reasons to expect a weak jobs report Still in the end economic strength in the labor market appears to have been greater than even the most optimistic economist forecasted Indeed many expected a hiring slowdown and a focus on economic weakness would be a problemNow the concern would appear to be the opposite at least that was the concern when markets first opened However this report seems to confirm that a soft landing is underway because jobs are being gained and labor participation is high and steady Yet the wage gains are slowing and do not appear likely to reignite inflationary pressureNobody predicted a superhot report and those who discussed it thought it would play out very differently Even seasoned market minds who discussed the prospect of a hot report were utterly wrong about how the market would respond to one For example consider this quote from Scott Wapners program on CNBC yesterdayI am a big fan of Josh Browns analysis and while I dont always agree with his take on markets I know hes a knowledgeable guy who does his homework Frankly yesterday I would have agreed with his take We look at the price on a screen like it is one thing Like it changes at the whim of some unforeseen invisible hand But the price is one of the best pieces of information you have because it reflects so many different decisions in one piece of informationThe price may be one thing on your screen but it is the sum of billions of decisions and transactions So the lesson is not that Mr Brown is a lousy commentator it is that the market humbles us all with its collective wisdom that inherently transcends what we can comprehend from the individual perspective And I think the market took time to process the report and saw precisely what I saw stark evidence of a soft landing As you can see below the recent rise in rates has not been because of inflation anyway its more about increasing term premia which is The analysis leading up to the report was a perfect case study of what happens when the crowd uses heuristics about secondorder thinking to substitute for actual secondorder thinking In the market various catchphrases tend to spread like wildfire and substitute the complex critical thought necessary to achieve alpha and a leg up over the crowd Good news is bad news is one such aphorism that may have shreds of truth but it also requires an underlying understanding of why to preserve intellectual dexterityFirstly lets dispel the assumption that the Fed doesnt want you to have a job right now Im sure Fed Chair Jay Powell and even the most hawkish members of the FOMC want you to have a job It builds character and selfesteem It puts money in your pocket They want you to have a job for the same reason that old Mom and Dad encouraged you to get one They dont want workers to have too high a degree of bargaining power in the market relative to employers because they can push up wages fast enough to reignite inflationary pressure The Fed is trying to avoid a wageprice spiral not trying to get you firedBut suppose the high labor costs dont lead to higher prices and workers ability to demand higher wages declines In that case you have the best of both worlds falling inflation without the collateral damage of adverse dislocation in the labor market So this report confirms that a soft landing is indeed possible Not only that job growth appears to be driven by consumers at the lower end of the income spectrum and labor participation has stayed at high levels always a tonic for nervous hawksWhen the market opened down I was going to write that this was a buying opportunity However the market beat me to it I cant stress this enough I think a market rally on a scorching jobs report is a significant positive and in some ways a more bullish outcome than I could have imagined I think markets will rise from here and Q4 will live up to its seasonal strengthLook there were definitely some angry bears this morning who thought they were about to cash in That doesnt mean theyre wrong about everything The rising debt obligations of the United States and the potential for these levels to crowd out private sector activity are becoming more real by the day At the same time it may urge the Fed to make higher for longer last for less time than the market currently expectsThe backdrop of political chaos in one of Americas major political parties that could further gum up calcified political alliances that make reform difficult makes the problematic debt situation all the more ominous Another significant risk is that the UAW strike could cause some economic dislocation The following risks could derail any market rally thoughFurthermore inflation forecasts have been rising from economists If they are correct and inflation isnt defeated we may have much more volatility ahead of us and the prospect of a Fed policy error rises dramaticallySo while the rally on the jobs blowout counter to expectations is very bullish and makes me want to buy there are certainly no shortages of serious risks to contemplate Any one of them could derail a rally and make the yearend on a sour note Still I think it is likelier that we climb a wall of worry and end the year on a high noteThis mornings actions surprised a lot of folks myself included Nonetheless your conclusion from the herkyjerky market action this morning is ultimately bullish While the jobs number was hot it did not indicate that wages would reignite inflationary pressure So this turns good news being bad news into just plain good news It also paves the way for the coveted White Buffalo of financial markets a soft landingSupply and demand is a seemingly simple concept but it can be challenging to understand on a macro level when the labor market is involved Like the price headline labor numbers reflect a prodigious and complex reality that doesnt lend itself well to being boiled down to one number But beyond the headline number were really after observations about collective behavior The behavioral indicators suggest that it would be difficult to ignite the type of inflation that the Fed fears most It is even more difficult now that wage pressures appear to be alleviatingIf I am worried about a recession and I tighten my belt but then the expected drop in demand doesnt materialize or demand increases then not only have I likely expanded my margins I probably need to hire an extra hand or two to help with all the business I didnt expect I think this is what is going on in the economy and I think countervailing forces make a soft landing likelier than recent rate angst would suggest   Past

218,"Scorpio Tankers Q2: A New Fleet, A Strong Strategy, A Promising Future",  a leading provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide presents a compelling investment opportunity Despite the challenging market conditions the company has demonstrated resilience and strategic financial management which are key indicators of its potentialThe oil shipping market is influenced by a myriad of factors These include global oil supply and demand dynamics geopolitical events and broader economic conditions Each of these elements plays a significant role in shaping the industrys landscape and more specifically the spot rates for oil tankersGlobal oil supply is one of the key drivers of spot rates in the oil shipping market Spot rates the price for immediate charter of aCurrently we are witnessing a period of relatively low oil inventories which is contributing to an upward trend in spot rates This situation is beneficial for oil tanker companies like Scorpio Tankers as higher spot rates are leading to increased revenues and profitabilityAnother critical factor influencing the oil shipping market is the rate of fleet growth The number of new ships being built and added to the global fleet can significantly impact the supplydemand dynamics in the industry Currently the industry is experiencing lower fleet growth levels relative to historical averages This trend is primarily driven by high interest rates which make the financing of new ship construction more expensive and the fact that many shipyards are currently occupied with building other types of shipsThis lack of new ship construction is leading to a tightening of supply in the oil shipping market With fewer new ships entering the market the existing fleet is in higher demand which can further drive up spot rates For wellleveraged oil tanker businesses like STNG this situation presents an opportunity With a modern and efficient fleet they are wellpositioned to capitalize on these market dynamicsSTNGs financial results for  showed a net income of 1324 million and an adjusted net income of 1333 million While these figures represent a decrease from Q2 2022 its important to consider them in the broader context of the companys performance and the market conditionsThe global oil shipping market is known for its volatility with rates and revenues often fluctuating in response to changes in oil supply and demand geopolitical events and economic conditions Despite these challenges STNG has demonstrated a strong ability to navigate this complex landscape and generate increasing profitsLooking at the companys performance for the first half of 2023 H1 2023 STNG reported a net income of 3256 million and an adjusted net income of 3289 million These figures represent a significant increase compared to the same period in 2022 indicating a strong upward trend in the companys profitabilityFurthermore STNGs ability to maintain profitability despite the decrease in net income in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022 demonstrates the companys resilience in the face of market volatility It suggests that STNG has effective strategies in place to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities positioning it well for future growthManagement has been actively managing its debt through a combination of lease repayments debt reductions and new financing agreementsIn  STNG exercised purchase options on several vessels that were previously financed under various lease agreements This resulted in a significant aggregate debt reduction of 3002 million In July 2023 the company continued this strategy by exercising purchase options on six more vessels leading to an additional debt reduction of 1436 million STNG also gave notice to exercise purchase options on two more vessels which is expected to result in a further debt reduction of 365 million by the end of Q3 2023 This shows a strategy of wanting to deleverage especially away from more expensive lease agreementsIn addition to these debt reduction strategies STNG has also secured new financing agreements The company executed or received commitments for three separate credit facilities totaling up to 12 billion The first credit facility executed in May 2023 was a 1174 million facility from a European financial institution The second executed in July 2023 was a term loan and revolving credit facility from a group of financial institutions for up to 10 billion Upon execution 4406 million was drawn from this facility to finance 21 of the companys unencumbered vessels The remaining availability of this facility is expected to be drawn between Q3 2023 and the end of Q1 2024 primarily to repay and refinance more expensive lease financing The third credit facility commitment expected to close within Q3 2023 is a 94 million facility from DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale which will be used to finance four vesselsThese strategies reflect STNGs proactive approach to managing its debt By reducing its existing debt through the exercise of purchase options on leased vessels and securing new lowercost financing STNG is effectively lowering its interest expenses and improving its financial position This approach not only reduces the companys financial risk but also frees up resources that can be used to invest in its operations and growth initiativesScorpios active share repurchase program is a strong indicator of the companys confidence in its future prospects and its commitment to delivering shareholder value Share repurchase programs are often implemented when a company believes its shares are undervalued and represent a good investment In their  Scorpios management outlined their thoughts on this explicitly stating Share repurchases preferred over dividends when trading a significant discount to NAV During the most recent quarter STNG purchased 283 million worth of shares at an average price of 48 per share This move reduced the companys basic shares outstanding to 53 million from 568 million Since the start of 2023 STNG has repurchased a substantial 86 million shares for a total of 4211 million This aggressive repurchase strategy underscores the companys belief in its intrinsic value and its commitment to capitalizing on what it perceives to be a market undervaluation of its shares Over the past few months STNG has been buying shares at prices ranging from 43 to 49 per share demonstrating its commitment to this strategy and providing an idea of what they see is trading below NAVMoreover STNG still has 213 million remaining under its 2023 securities repurchase program At current prices around 50 per share this could potentially lead to the repurchase of an additional 426 million shares or roughly 75 of the current shares outstanding This further reduction in the number of shares outstanding could lead to an increase in earnings per share EPS all else being equal and continue to boost the share priceIts also worth noting that STNG has preferred share repurchases over dividends when its shares are trading at a significant discount to Net Asset Value NAV This strategy suggests that the company is focused on longterm value creation rather than shortterm yieldThe age of a companys fleet is a significant factor in the maritime shipping industry particularly for oil tankers The typical useful lifetime of an oil tanker is between 20 to 30 years After this period the cost of maintaining and operating the vessel often outweighs the benefits leading companies to retire and replace these older vesselsThe global fleets average age currently stands at 117 years This figure is a crucial benchmark as it provides context for comparing individual companies fleet ages A fleet age significantly below this average suggests a company is operating with newer vessels which often translates into operational and financial advantagesScorpio Tankers Inc stands out in this regard boasting a modern fleet with a Deadweight Tonnage weighted averageyear built of 2015 This figure is considerably newer than the global average and also surpasses some of Scorpios direct competitors For instance International Seaways  and Nordic American Tankers  both have fleet average build years of 2011Moreover some of these competitors fleets include ships that are reaching or have already reached their retirement age This situation could lead to substantial capital expenditures in the near future as these companies may need to invest in new vessels to maintain their operational capacityIn contrast Scorpios oldest ship was built in 2012 meaning none of its vessels are approaching retirement age and many are debtfree and still have dozens of years of operation This situation provides Scorpio with a significant advantage as it can avoid the substantial costs associated with replacing older vessels for the foreseeable futureThe benefits of a younger fleet extends beyond avoiding the costs of replacing older vessels Younger fleets often have lower maintenance costs as newer vessels are less likely to require significant repairs They also tend to be more fuelefficient and are more likely to meet the latest safety and environmental regulations which can lead to cost savings operational efficiencies and help reduce political risk associated with older vessels Scorpio Tankers conservative dividend payout ratio of 1042 demonstrates the companys strategic approach towards its longterm financial health By retaining a significant percentage of its earnings the company has more capital available for reinvestment into its operations and growth initiatives and for reducing its debt loadA focus on debt reduction is particularly advantageous in the current economic climate where rising interest rates are a concern for many businesses By reducing its net debt which has fallen from 2934 million in Q4 2021 to 1523 million currently Scorpio Tankers is effectively lowering its future interest payments This is significant because a substantial proportion of the companys debts are in the form of floating rate notes the interest rates of which increase in tandem with market rates A lower debt burden could even potentially lead to improved credit ratings and better loan terms in the futureDespite the expected drop in the Fleet TCE rate to 26210 from 32154 in Q2 the companys strategic financial management and modern fleet position it well to navigate these challenges The companys focus on debt reduction and share buybacks over dividends suggests a longterm growth strategy that could yield significant returns for investorsThe companys revenue is heavily tied to the global oil industry and fluctuations in oil supply and demand can directly impact its profitability This commodity price risk means that a drop in oil prices could reduce the demand for oil transportation leading to lower revenues for Scorpio Tankers which is predicted by Scorpio in their latest earningsFurthermore the companys significant debt load a portion of which is subject to floating interest rates exposes it to interest rate risk Should interest rates rise Scorpio Tankers could see its interest expenses increase substantially affecting its profitability and ability to service its debt The company also faces regulatory risk as the shipping industry is subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations Changes in these regulations could necessitate major capital expenditures potentially impacting Scorpio Tankers financial performance Operational risks inherent to the shipping industry include potential accidents piracy and environmental disasters which could lead to significant costs damage to the companys reputation and potential legal liabilities Finally the cyclical nature of the shipping industry and its susceptibility to global economic conditions geopolitical events and changes in seaborne trade patterns create market risk for Scorpio Tankers Downturns in the shipping cycle could decrease demand for the companys services and put downward pressure on shipping rates which could potentially impact revenuesWith all of this information on dividends  stock buy backs and overall strong market tail winds How do we value STNG not only against the overall market but also against some of its peers From a dividend perspective STNG is trading slightly higher than their 4Y average of 197 at an estimated FWD rate of 211 It is the lowest among its peers especially when you add in INSWs special dividends that dont show up in their yield in the TTM or Fwd But they also have a low payout ratio so as they finish up deleveraging and as their stock rises to a point they feel matches their NAV they will likely begin to focus more on dividends and less on stock buybacks I imagine that target NAV valuation is around the 5255 mark and I expect them to continue to have large stock buybacks below that price Delving into the Price to Earnings ratio Scorpio Tankers stands out with a trailing twelve months  PE ratio of 327 the lowest among its peers This can be attributed to its relatively high debt load as evidenced by its EVMarket Cap ratios This ratio provides a snapshot of a companys financial situation encompassing debt cash and market value STNGs position towards the higher end of this industry ratio suggests its financial strength may be less robust compared to competitors like INSW and DHTHowever the future looks promising for STNG I anticipate that as the company manages its debt more effectively and harnesses the industrywide earnings momentum to boost its cash reserves it will be better capitalized This improved financial health should enable the company to provide increased returns to its investors and drive a nonlinear return especially if Spot Charter Rates stay elevated In my view Scorpio Tankers Inc represents an attractive investment opportunity especially in terms of its Net Asset Value Given the high valuations of ships and STNGs relatively new fleet I believe purchasing its shares at any price below 57 represents good value If the price drops below 40 it would be a highly attractive investmentIts important to remember though that the market is cyclical and can be significantly influenced by geopolitical events which can quickly shift price targets While this price target isnt high relative to the current prices levels I like to set low Price Targets that I believe afford optimum riskreward ratios rather than pie in the sky valuations that companies will struggle to grow in to Scorpio Tankers Inc presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance strategic debt management active share repurchase program modern fleet and low fleet to EV valuation    Past performance is no

219,My View On Wall Street: I Assess The Pros And Cons,"The SP 500 has declined about 95 since I last published the Equity Market PROs and CONs report on July 28th At the end of July investors were flying high as the major indices had put in an impressiveWe closed out another losing month in September and set sail into Q4 and now well revisit the PROs and CONS that are on the scene today In this report the  128  with 2 issues that I consider NeutralThe last two months of trading in the market have been difficult for the BULLS The major averages peaked in late Julyearly August and have been trending lower everInvestor sentiment took forever to turn bullish this year ironically it turned earlier this summer just in time for equities to peak and pull back in August and September This typical contrarian indicator worked again Now its back to bearish for investors The Bespoke Investor Sentiment Composite is negative once again and CNNs Fear  Greed Index is registering Fear right now Since the sentiment is contrarian excess bearishness is considered BullishSeasonality was a Con in my last PROs and CONs report and unfortunately for the BULLS it didnt disappoint August and September weakness for equities held to form this year but now seasonality moves back into the PRO column as Q4 is typically the best time of year for stocks As shown below in the snapshot from the Bespoke Seasonality Tool the upcoming 3month period has been the very best 3month period of the year for stocks over the last ten yearsThe 100th percentile for gains is certainly bullishCore inflation has come down and is showing signs of stability Supercore inflation is deflating slower but still making progress While inflation isnt DEAD the stock market by its price action after the last report believes the peak is definitely in and is ready to deal with current readings for a while longerInitial jobless claims have steadied while employment growth has slowed Primeage employment remains just shy of a recordhigh share of the population While job openings have declined indicating weaker labor demand the level remains very high compared to historical readingsConsumers still have lots of cash on their balance sheets even relative to much stronger consumer spending relative to prepandemic While savings rates are low consumer borrowing is wellcovered by income and households can keep spending at a healthy if slowly moderating pace for some time When consumers have jobs they will continue to spend In addition Corporations are not about to give up the employees they had a hard time acquiring after the pandemic That keeps the labor situation tightA range of manufacturing industries are rapidly adding factory capacity in response to recent industrial policy CHIPS BIL IRA Construction on factories is running north of 200bn per year with hundreds of billions more in spending to come At the same time the housing market is still short of inventory and will be for years to come Finally infrastructure spending has accelerated sharply thanks to fiscal policy and is not showing any signs of slowing down Its a doubleedged sword Good news for select sectors of the economy but it also keeps Debt and Inflation elevatedDuring the 2022 bear market rolling 12month forward earnings estimates fell 65 from peak to trough Since then they have recovered almost the entire decline Of course analysts tend to lag the market and estimates only started getting cut well after the 2022 bear market was underway Still underlying earnings are in good shape Recent results have also started to turn more positive The EPS beat rate fell from its historic postCOVID surge but over the last few months has ramped back up again A similar more modest recovery in guidance raise rates is also taking placeThe equity market thrives on themes and AI has been the markets theme in a big way for most of this year Theres a good chance this becomes a  rather than  wave Over the long term that is bullish for equities Every week there seems to be some new technology in the AI space introduced and search interest for AI topics remains elevated and trending higherThe only question is when will real money hit the bottom lineOutside of the megacaps in the SP 500 it has been a flat year for the market So even though the capweighted SP 500 is still showing a 10 YTD gain things arent nearly as rosy underneath the surface The median SP 500 stock is flat while the median stock in the smallcap Russell 2000 is solidly in the red at 7 That doesnt look like the new BULL market backdrop that the majority says it is As the week ended I now see ALL of the indices barely above their Long term trendlines This equity market  is living on the edgeMain Street media always talk about the 2year10year Treasury Yield curve The Fed also watches another metric The 3month10year Treasury yield curve has now been inverted for a record 222 consecutive trading days The curve reached its maximum point of inversion in early May at 183 basis points and has steepened to its current level of 75 Given that it has been nearly a year since the curve first inverted and the economy still appears to be steady theres a growing consensus that the current signal has been a false alarmBut dont dismiss the yield curve too quickly As shown in the table below historically the average number of days between when the yield curve first inverts to the start of a recession is 589 daysFrom the time the yield curve bottoms to the start of a recession the average is 395 days Based on these two figures a recession in the second half of 2024 would fit right within the averagesThe Leading Economic Indicators index published by the Conference Board takes a range of different economic and financial market data points into account and creates a single index that tends to deteriorate before recessions and recover before activity bottoms As shown in the chart  In other words if we dont see a recession following this run of data it will be an unprecedented resultThe Leading Indicators have fallen for 18 consecutive months Only two other periods have seen longer streaks of decline the mid1970s recession and the global financial crisisThere is a consensus view that the FOMC is near its terminal rate or close to it However the message we heard this week from Chair Powell is  Its HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut  then that means the economy is falling off a cliff That too is pretty scary The Fed is in a box and along with the market is facing a loselose situationHome prices have surged thanks to a mismatch between supply and demand High mortgage rates mean existing homeowners are unwilling to surrender extremely low rates further restricting supplyThose high mortgage rates also damage affordability driven by high prices When combined affordability has hit the worst levels since the 1980s with the average nonmanagerial worker needing to pay the equivalent of 867 hours of wages to cover the mortgage payment for the median existing home assuming 5 down And down payments are increasingly difficult to save up given high pricesThe shock to the banking system delivered late last year and early this year has largely been digested by the market However leading indicators of bank credit suggest a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank lending over the next yearThe SLOOS Senior Loan Officer Outlook Survey asks lenders whether they are seeing higher or lower demand for credit as well as whether they are raising or lowering the standards they underwrite to As shown in the chart below the reported demand for credit and the reported credit standards suggest that commercial  industrial CI loan growth is set to slow dramaticallyDeclining credit outstanding would only do bad things for the economic backdropThe terrorist attack in Israel highlights another US policy error From a financial point of view that brings the country into another conflict The US debt issue was highlighted in last weeks MACRO update It appears the US is now supporting two wars Ukraine and now Israel along with the continuing overhang of the ChinaTaiwan situation come at a time when the US finds itself in the  since WWII This country has never been more stretched and vulnerable and at some point this will have a serious impact on the MACRO economic scene At some point the market sniffs this MACRO issue as the serious threat that it isTwo years ago we could look at an SP 500 PE ratio in the high teens or even 20 and say that at least interest rates were low Bespoke Investment group On a trailing basis the SP 500 trades for 206 times earnings and while that is far from a record it ranks in the 83rd percentile relative to all other readings in the postWWII era Comparing the earnings yield of the SP 500 inverse of the PE ratio to the yield on the 10year US Treasury the current spread of 025 percentage points is the lowest since 2010While the market is expensive the key driver of the valuation stems from the largest stocks in the index As shown below the 10largest stocks in the index which account for 32 of the SP 500 trade for a median of 317 times earnings with four stocks trading for over 65 times earningsMeanwhile the median multiple of the remaining 490 stocks is 20 times trailing earnings That was OK when interest rates were zero but at 5 we are in a different backdrop that typically takes PE ratios downThis CON has been on the list since the beginning of the year yet stocks have risen As mentioned earlier the SP 500s earnings yield relative to Treasury yields and real rates is at its lowest levels in decades meaning stocks are less attractive relative to riskfree rates The SP 500s dividend yield was more than 100 basis points higher than the 2year Treasury yield two years ago  There is an alternative to stocks again As uncertainty ramps higher investors will reach for riskfree yield All of that cash that many analysts and BULLS say is on the sidelines and will go into stocks seems more like a Hope trade Those analysts are living in the pastWhile inflation readings have come down dramatically over the last year the June Year overyear reading of 29 might be as good as it gets in the near term Huge monthovermonth increases in CPI in early 2022 are now removed from the yy CPI tally which will make it harder for CPI to continue lower in the coming months unless we see outright deflation which is not currently projected Investors expecting the yy CPI number to continue lower may be surprised to see it keep ticking higher up towards 354 through yearend and beyond The latest PCE report confirms that inflation is still hanging on and any further progress will be SLOWFrom the October 2022 peak through the July 14th bottom the broad tradeweighted dollar fell 84 Over the last three months it has risen close to 4 Since 1973 largerthantypical dollar rallies have led to lowerthantypical SP 500 returns As long as the dollar is strong its doubtful the stock market will take off in a big way Of course the inverse statement is also true a reversal lower in the dollar would set up a positive backdropThe bull markets uptrend from the October 2022 low has been celebrated but as I have continually pointed out the nearterm technicals do not look good They still have a lot to prove before I can BUY into the New BULL market sceneWeve seen  since the market made its high for the year on the last day of July For this negative technical action to turn well need indices to break above their early September highsThe results of all five of the regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys for September were released Altogether regional Fed surveys have shown that manufacturing activity improved slightly in September The PRO crowd will claim that we have seen the bottom and improvement is on its wayThe folks that present the Bearish argument say Show me They point out that after two years of declines the net readings are still in contraction territory The fact that stocks hit such extreme oversold levels towards the end of September  a notoriously weak time of year for stocks  is a PRO in the minds of an optimist as there is a tendency for prices to revert when they get this overdoneFurthermore Treasury yields the dollar and oil are all at extremes to the upside at the same time It doesnt take much for a big reversal to occur when things get this onesided That is true BUT extreme conditions can last for longer than an investor wants to believe Hoping for a change in direction is a bad strategyThis time around there are some distinct changes on the list In July the standout on the PRO side was the trend reversal resulting in a BULL market backdrop that I said trumped just about all of the negatives This time around we see that has changed again as many indices and the DJIA along with the Russell 2000 are back in a BEAR backdropOn the CON side the TARA argument is still there and it has started to impact the market especially when uncertainty ramps up There is plenty of cash on the sidelines but probabilities suggest a lot of that cash wont make it into equities due to the riskfree alternatives This is one of the reasons I do not see another riproaring BULL market leg to new alltime highs on the horizon The Earnings forecast is the one issue to watch and  It is a fluid situation that can change quickly At the end of the day that will control what happens in the very near term After I put the report together I came away with the feeling that the PROs are centered around the nearterm prospects while many of the CONs speak to the MACRO viewLast weeks selling pressure bled over to Mondays open with the SP establishing a new intraday low during this correction However buyers emerged and the SP rebounded to post a modest sevenpoint loss The price action was typical for a market that is trying to find a bottom Intraday rallies dissipate and there is plenty of choppy price action The NASDAQ snapped a 4day losing streak with a modest gain No such luck for the other indices The SP extended its daily losing streak to 5 with the DJIA and Russell 2000 establishing 4 straight days of lossesMore choppy trading on Tuesday was eventually resolved to the upside something we havent seen in a while All major indices and every sector posted gains for the day as investors celebrated another Turnaround TuesdayThe party ended there for the BULLS The combined losses for the SP 500 in the last 3 days of trading tallied 3 While the NASDAQ

220,Market Is Set Up For A February 2020 Type Collapse,Following the summer rally the market has been on a gradual decline in recent weeks Gains are showing signs of rapid unwinding after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated policymakers support for  rates to tame inflation TheThe latest Fed dot plot shows support for the Fed Funds rate to hit the 550 to 575 range by yearend implying another 25 bps increase at either the upcoming November or December policy meeting Rate cut expectations for 2024 have also tempered with policymakers latest projection implying a benchmark rate at 51 by the end of next year which is about 50 bpsMeanwhile the economy has withstood the most aggressive cycle of rate hikes in decades better than expected  both consumer spending and the labour market have been resilient incentivizing an upward revision to the 2023 economic growth projection from 1 in June to  with the expected unemployment rate tweaked lower from 45 to 41 Although data suggests a soft landing is possible Chair Powell has denied such a scenario as the  and reiterated the Feds stance to keep monetary policy in restrictive territory for longerThe remarks have taken the longend Treasury yield above a  in recent weeks while equity performance has also been  Although bonds have been pricing in the new normal of restrictive monetary policy for a while now equity valuations appear to only now be catching up We see several risks that are rapidly brewing into reality which could suggest a sustained downtrend in the SP  and Nasdaq  valuations from current levelsInflation has shown signs of  over the summer but risks of a reacceleration are still running high This is corroborated by August figures that came in  with both core and headline inflation running hot on the resurgence of energy costs and stubbornly high shelter costsSpecifically oil prices have climbed nearly 25 from their summer lows representing  over the past quarter and trading comfortably above the 90 range While oil prices have largely been driven by weak sentiment during the first half of the year primarily influenced by fears of weakening demand due to Chinas deteriorating economy which has overshadowed OPEC supply curbs the reality of tightening supplies is settling in And this is reflected in the recent surge in gasoline prices which contributed to more than half of Augusts monthly price increase Meanwhile the outlook on food prices also remains mixed as the combination of rising energy and labour costs alongside shortages in  and  due to extreme weather remain headwinds Taken together both core and noncore prices continue to face prominent risks of resurgence underscoring Augusts figures may be a warning signWith inflation still running hot the higher for longer narrative is likely to settle in as the new normal We fear that this setup may be ushering in the most adverse implication possible  the Fed may stop pursuing a Goldilocks soft landing scenario and opt for a forced correction of the economy as the situation becomes increasingly politically driven And Chair Powells recent rejection of the economic soft landing as a baseline scenario is corroborative of this risk The higher for longer rate environment has pushed Treasury yields toward an alltime high  Treasury yields have rapidly surged beyond the 46 range while the  is approaching 47 Meanwhile the ratesensitive  yield has experienced a relatively gradual uptrend reaching about 51At these levels the government faces acute financial pressure to funding operations For context nearly a third of total US government debt outstanding is set to hit maturity within the next 12 months with more than a half set to mature over the next three yearsThis underscores the massive refinancing needed over the foreseeable future and more importantly the governments exposure to impact from an adverse rate environment The  on related debt has already surged from 15 from when it was last financed to now 30 And the doubling rate is poised to climb further in tandem with rising interest rates underscoring quarterly interest expense payments beyond the current alltime high of  in no timeThe everincreasing federal debt burden coupled with rising debt service costs implies the potential for tax increases which could adversely impact the economy further as stillhot inflation and tightening financial conditions run simultaneously in the background More importantly the combination will be adverse to the Biden administrations outlook on extending its term heading into the 2024 reelection To prevent this unfavourable mix Chair Powell and Co may need to tighten credit conditions further to manually orchestrate the slowdown needed to put the economy into correction putting conditions for a soft landing further out of reachAdding pressure to this dire setup is the mechanics of leveraged rate funds that have been increasing their short wagers on Treasury leading up to the September FOMC meeting The netshort positions on Treasuries futures held by leveraged funds reached their  in more than a decade in August incentivized by persistent economic challenges spanning inflation tight labour market and the hawkish Fed The  on cash Treasury and futures prices may have also incentivized the buildup of bearish bets However the recent surge in yields could potentially lead to an unwind of this netshort positioning and pressure bonds performance further by creating shock waves that will ripple throughout the market The unpredictably elevated nature of longend Treasury yields is corroborated by the  of the five and 30year Treasury yield curve last week  a year after the curves inversion reached its  in more than a decadeIn addition to persistent inflation and tightening financial conditions the overvalued nature of equity valuations at current levels is what greenlights the impending risk of a broader market crash Prior to the onset of the late September market slump the SP 500 had been trading at a record high of almost 30x forward earnings representing a rich valuation premium to 10year average of about 23x Much of this uptrend had been buoyed by the markets frenzy for AI with the Magnificent Seven stocks  namely Apple  Amazon  Google    Meta Platforms  Microsoft  Nvidia  and Tesla   trading at an average forward PE of more than 40x and accounting for about  of the SP 500 indexs performance But the SP 500 exMagnificent Seven is not cheap either  it currently trades at about 24x estimated earnings and still exceeds the 10year average of about 21x on the normalized gauge The resurgence of tech valuations is corroborated by the Nasdaq 100s lofty premium builtup this year  the techheavy index is currently trading at  estimated earnings far exceeding its historical average of about Although longend Treasury yields have long been pushing new highs since the onset of the latest rate hike cycle which have been adverse to growth valuations underpinned by cash flows further out in the future the markets rally this year has largely defied these challenges most prominently observed during 2022 Markets had likely been pricing in expectations for an eventual normalization in the rate environment during the first half of the year as improving inflationary pressures harbinger the impending unwinding of monetary policy tightening This is supported by observations of historically low equity risk premium priced into market valuationsRecall that the ERP measures the difference between returns on equities versus the riskfree rate of return on Treasury The yield on shortend Treasury bills had consistently exceeded the average return on equity as measured by the inverse of the SP 500 PE ratio during the first half of the year  a first since 2000  likely on the back of expectations for increased visibility on an eventual trajectory back towards monetary policy easing Even with the recent slump in stock valuations the  on threemonth Tbills still exceeds the average 42 return on equities computed on the inverse of SP 500 exMagnificent Seven PE ratio of about 24x despite the latters higher risk exposureThis suggests that the markets latest declines following the Feds reaffirmation on a higher for longer rate reality is a reflection of swift adjustments to the ERP While valuations have not budged in the face of continued rate hikes during the first half of 2023 they might very well start to as the potential of a soft landing and eventual policy easing are pushed back until further notice Recall the CAPM model which dictates the cost of equity based on both the stock and broader markets risk profile The cost of equity is computed as the riskfree rate plus the equity beta multiplied by the ERPThe cost of equity is typically more sensitive to changes in the ERP than the riskfree rate itself As markets are likely to upwardly adjust the ERP in response to the new normal of higher for longer interest rates the discount factor on future cash flows accordingly increases risking a further decline in equity valuations from current levelsCurrently lofty market valuations also face brewing weakness among financial names While market sentiment has normalized since the slew of regional bank failures in March it does not materially change the reality that an elevated rate environment does not bode well for the financial sector Higher rates essentially mean higher borrowing costs and narrowing net interest margins for the banks Customers will continue to be incentivized to rotate their deposits into higheryielding products and accounts impacting the availability of lowcost funding for banks to service its lending operations and inadvertently pressuring net interest income Meanwhile borrowing will likely remain weak in the face of an elevated rate environment as home buyers and investors stay riskaverse which will hamper banks earnings furtherWhile both regulators and banks have  capital buffer requirements to better cope with a severe economic shock especially following the slew of bank failures earlier this year the sectors exposure to weakness persists amid the elevated rate environment As Treasury yields continue to rise the value of longterm notes held by banks diminishes While much of these losses stay unreported on PL as banks stash the holdings away as available for sale securities with their unrealized gains  losses flowing through AOCI the diminishing value of bond assets affects banks level of equity on the balance sheet The average capital requirement  or CET1 ratio  for large banks currently  which implies that for every 10 the bank lends it must have at least 0895 of capital in reserve This also indicates that banks typically operate at about 10x leverage which exposes them to risks of a significant equity value correction in the event of material depreciation to asset value  a case proven in the failures of    and Taken together the window of weakness on equities is rapidly expanding at current levels The durability of current valuation premiums are becoming increasingly at risk given weakness in underlying fundamentals amid the elevated rate environmentIn addition to persistent inflation higher for longer interest rates and lofty equity valuations there is also a broadening portfolio of other moving pieces indicative of further market weakness to come The US government has narrowly dodged a shutdown this weekend with the agreement on a  for ongoing negotiations regarding longterm funding But this does not eradicate the impending risk of a potential nodeal which could bring on adverse implications for equity valuationsThe market has historically rallied upon the end of a government shutdownaverted shutdown This was also the case earlier this year when the government had averted a shutdown and potential financial crisis after an agreement to  the US debt ceiling However the increasing frequency of government shutdown risks two times this year amidst an inflationary environment and tightening financial conditions is unprecedented This is in line with the markets modest response to the latest risk of a government shutdown  much of the recent market downside realized were likely attributable to the reality of a higher interest rate environment settling in which means that the averted shutdown is unlikely to be a big source of upside in the neartermBut the mire of political drama is likely to further dampen confidence in the US governments ability to navigate the economy back to health Current models estimate a  headwind to annualized GDP growth for each week of government shutdown that could potentially take place in the fourth quarter if the 45day impasse ends with no deal A further extension could also  the Feds efforts to quell inflation risking a reversal of recent progress made The  which measures stock market volatility expectations also remains dampened at sub20 levels considering the current market risk profile Under the  which divides the current VIX by 16 to gauge the implied stock market movement current options pricing suggests a 1 daily movement in the SP 500 We do not think this has sufficiently derisked for impending market risksInstead the modest VIX is likely underpriced for the current market risk profile setup due to the supply and demand mechanics in options markets influenced primarily by structured product funds Specifically options selling for passive income at some of these funds may be weighing on the VIX resulting in the gauges inadequate reflection of pentup stock market volatility which risks becoming an overlooked factorAnother implied risk to consider is the historical link between monthend options expiry mopex that happens on the third Friday of each month and an equity market collapse The onset of the equity market collapse observed in February 2020 had coincided with mopex on February 21 This eerily resembles the latest stock slump which began the third Friday of September in line with the latest mopex The narrative on weakening consumption amid inflationary pressures and an elevated borrowing cost environment has been brewing for more than a year Yet corporate earnings have largely stayed resilient leading markets to contemplate if relevant risks have already been priced into current market valuationsThe resilient labour market amid the latest cycle of monetary policy tightening has been a primary counteractive force to the adverse combination of dwindling pandemicera savings and persistent inflation But this last lever is likely going to give soon Credit card delinquencies are  prepandemic levels while the resumption of  this month is likely to weigh on household budgets further Specifically cutting out room in budgets for student loan repayments is expected to displace  in annual discretionary spending and impact GDP growth by 01 this year and 03 next yearUnfortunately the added burden on consumer budgets also coincides with the timeline of which the lagging monetary policy effect on labour markets is due to materialize Different parts of the economy have different sensitivities to monetary policy tightening And for the labour markets which has been resilient through it all so far typically start to feel the impact of monetary tightening at the 18 to 24month mark That means the full force of the 0 to 55 rate hikes implemented since March 2022 are about to be felt by the labour market from here on out potentially eradicating a key source of strength that has been keeping the economy afloat so far With at least one more rate hike in the books the impact of weakening consumer spending might finally be starting to hit the underlying fundamentals critical to supporting the markets lofty valuation premiums at current levelsWhile 2023 has largely defied the markets pessimism and turned out to be a good year for equities so far vulnerabilities to a violent downturn remain close The combination of Fed hawkishness political motives weakening economic fundamentals and a potential earnings recession could risk sending new shock waves to the broader markets putting the case for a soft landing further out of reach The setup is becoming increasingly unfavourable to the durability of equity valuation premiums at current levels driving up risks that the latest uptrend might

221,Tighten Your Seatbelts,Shifting supplyanddemand dynamics appear to be driving bond markets more than fundamentals which makes for a bumpy rideWith our annual  outlook just around the corner weve recently been discussing some ofIn fixed income we think a key theme will be one that most strategists did not have in their outlooks for 2023 but which was nonetheless prominent and could persist into 2024 the overwhelming importance of bond market supply and demand in setting prices and yields which at times superseded the direction suggested by economic and credit fundamentalsWe think it is worth singling this theme out As we close in on the end of this historic tightening cycle central bank policy is subsiding as a source of uncertainty and the ebb andThrough the fourth quarter of 2022 US and global growth outlooks were becoming steadily more pessimistic By the end of the year for most economists and strategists the debate was not if but when the recessions would occur during 2023What happened to credit spreadsFor the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index they went from almost 590 basis points at the start of the fourth quarter of 2022 to as low as 430 basis points by March 2023 For the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Corporate Bond Index they went from around 180 basis points to less than 130 For the ICE BofA Global Hybrid Corporate Index they tightened from 340 to 240 basis points The minibanking crisis in March caused a spike but spreads have drifted tighter again through the rest of the yearWas this because the US economy unexpectedly continued to grow even as China and much of Europe stagnated Perhapsbut that wouldnt explain why we saw the same journey in European high yield and emerging markets spreadsA much better explanation in our view is the dearth of new corporate bond issuance in the first half of the year Throughout much of 2021 and 2022 corporate issuers financed aggressively relative to their needs taking advantage of recordlow rates That meant many coffers were full by the close of 2022 Bond market inflows have been modest this year because many investors have been happy to sit in cash or money markets earning 5 But with high yields now on offer the inflows werent negativeand when that modest demand met almost nonexistent supply it tightened spreadsRight now of course attention is focused on the rates market rather than credit markets Core government bond yields have burst out of their 2023 trading ranges with the 10year US Treasury yield adding some 65 basis points in little over a month to trade higher than at any time since early 2007 What might be going on hereWell certainly the US Federal Reserves steady drumbeat of higher rates for longereven though inflation has been decliningis settling into the market psyche Its difficult to lay the blame on changes to fundamental inflation expectations The move in the nominal yield curve has been matched by a move in the real yields leaving inflation expectations unchanged Instead meaningful changes in the supplyanddemand dynamic appear to be playing a large role here as wellThe August Treasury refunding saw a significant lift in coupon issuance and the market has come to the realization that this is the beginning of a durable trend While the Feds shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening has been welltelegraphed and understood by market participants the Treasurys growing fiscal deficit is surprising on the high side Together they currently amount to close to 10 of US GDP with quantitative tightening accounting for around 3Spending continues to rise while revenues have dropped by 10 for the fiscal yeartodate relative to 2022 largely due to a heavy decline in capital gains tax receipts The deficit is expected to be around 16 trillion this year versus around 1 trillion last year Current forecasts for 2024 are around 18 trillion with rising interest expense continuing to contribute much of the lift We think this means Treasury coupon issuance could roughly double from this years level of just over 1 trillion to as much as 19 trillion in 2024a massive supply shiftOn the other side of the equation in addition to the Fed going from largescale buyer to seller US commercial banks traditionally a major source of demand are mostly absent because their existing bond holdings are both large and underwater and because of heightened market and regulatory scrutiny following the minibanking crisis earlier in the yearThe offshore bid for US bondsan important source of demand ever since the global financial crisishas also been all but eliminated as the rapid rise in US short rates relative to those in many other markets has resulted in prohibitively high currencyhedging costs Finally active money managers ourselves included would usually have been keen to take advantage of such a dramatic rise in yields by adding portfolio duration but holdings analysis and sentiment surveys suggest that as a group money managers have already spent much of their firepowerDoes this mean the march to higher yields will continue unabated Not necessarily Three particularly large sources of demand loom on the horizonThe massive and evergrowing mountain of cash residing in money market funds and other shortterm investments could start to move as soon as there is a whiff of change to monetary policy in the air Likewise as longduration highgrade corporate bond yields move into the 6  range liabilitydriven pension fund investors may start to shift allocations toward themFinally while short to intermediateterm correlations between Treasuries and risky assets have been consistently positive recently that could change rapidly if risk aversion rises creating a potentially strong bid for bondsWith such strong shifting supplyanddemand forces waiting to exert themselves in Treasury and credit markets investors would do well to be ready for sudden regime changes and volatile price actionWe have waited a long time for value to return to fixed income markets With nominal yields at levels we havent seen in 16 years combined with an attractive move to higher real yields we are generally comfortable clipping a healthy coupon in todays market even if the ride has become bumpier and is likely to stay that wayTighten seatbeltsand count the income ,0,2023-10-09,0
222,"Global Medical: 7.7% Yielding Preferreds Are Expensive, A Look At Alternatives",Global Medical REIT Inc  is a medical office building play that we have covered before After two buy ratings we moved to the sidelines in our last pieceThere was really nothing strongly negative about theSource GMREs Q22023 was about in line but we saw the slow and steady impact from the interest rate hikes Fixed charge coverage was steadily moving lower and we are likely to see the same trend in Q32023Interest expenses are up substantially from Q22022 and funds from operations FFO and adjusted FFO are both falling under the pressureIt is fascinating that we are here despite a primarily fixedrate regime for the REITThe weighted maturity does still look small and that represents the biggest risk to the long term health of the company The company is aware of this and is actively managing things before there are problemsSourcePortfolio level metrics look great as they always have We would not expect any deterioration here outside of a very severe recessionGMRE has a soft lease maturity schedule for the remainder of 2023 and then we have over 14 coming up for renewal in 2024Occupancy levels remain near 97 and this is the other area to monitor While the two office buildings and medical office buildings are not identical there are overlaps It is not too uncommon to find doctors having clinics in general office space and also seeing general office space upgraded to accommodate doctors With the plethora of office space that is begging for attention this is a risk that investors should look out for Keep in mind that doctors are not the class of tenants that will move to save a few dollars Practice location and convenience are key Most also have staffing shortages and moving to a new location might make that worse But it is a longer term risk factor for this area Even in the more complex area of laboratory spaces which Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc  specializes in we have seen  So while the asset class may be recession resistant it is not going to defy the laws of supply and demandWhichever way you look at it GMREPRA is of course safer than the common shares After all you have the large common equity buffer in frontBut is this the best bang for your buck Probably not One issue we have with GMREPRA is just how lopsided the setup is on this thanks to the very high coupon of 75 GMREPRA trades right near par with a 77 Now that does not sound like a problem by itself but you have the risk of a call immediately in the next rate cut cycle So you have minimal upside and yes all the downside if interest rates go higher or if the gradual destruction of value in the company We will illustrate our point further with two examplesIn the realm of REITs triple nets tend to be the safest The parent company here Spirit Realty Capital  sports a BBB rating GMRE does not have a credit rating SRC has a  The weighted average lease maturity is over 10 years On a credit quality SRC is definitely going to be miles and miles ahead of GMRE But you get about the same yield from both preferred shares with SRCPRA giving you 748 The big difference here is that SRCPRA trades at 2006 offering you substantial upside to par in case of interest rate cutsThis is from EPR Properties  which  We will focus on this one even though EPR has two other preferred share series This one is a straight preferred no convertible calculations and offers a 791 yield currently It too trades at a big discount to par and offers substantial upside in case of a rate cutting cycleOn a credit quality basis as well we see EPR preferreds as somewhere between GMREPRA and SRCPRA So relative to GMREPRA you are getting higher credit quality and more upside if interest rates are cutCommon shares now offer a 94 yield and we think that will be maintained for the foreseeable future Of course growth is going to be next to impossible as the AFFO payout ratio approaches 100 and the company can only issue equity below NAV But the stock still has value and we think we can eek out 1012 returns from here by opportunistically using covered calls Our last executed covered calls are shown below and they reduced the volatility of our position substantiallyThe preferred shares seem remarkably expensive relative to what is available today We would only be interested in GMREPRA shares if they offer a 82 plus yield targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety The volatility of these investments is further lowered  Our  Portfolio is designed to  while

223,Enterprise Products Partners: The Highest-Quality 8%-Yielding Wide Moat MLP,The energy sector is highly complex It consists of so many fundamental influences and industries that its easy to lose track  especially when looking for something specificEssentially the energy industry consists of three major partsAs the overview below shows upstream companies are the ones that produce natural gas and crude oil which is the basis for a wide range of products including gasoline diesel and various chemicalsThe companies turning raw products into finished products are refiners However in order for these companies to get access to feedstock midstream companies are needed These companies provide storage and pipelines to ship ie oil to refineriesThe finished products are then shipped to the end customer using midstreamHaving said that upstream midstream and downstream all have pros and consInvestors looking to capitalize on rising oil and gas prices are better off buying upstream companies as these companies have revenue streams tied to the price of commoditiesRefiners are dependent on the crack spread which is the profit margin of refiners that buy oil to turn it into diesel gasoline and other products These companies also are price sensitive just different from upstream companiesMidstream companies are the most boring companies  but in a good wayThese companies are dependent on the amount of product flowing through their pipelines and contract prices Most companies also have takeorpay contracts which allow them to generate revenue regardless of whether customers use their pipelinesThe benefit is that cash flows tend to come with very low volatility which is great for dividend safety The drawdown is that investors do not benefit from a potentially steep increase in commodity prices On the flip side investors also do not suffer if prices dropThe biggest risk is a scenario where commodity prices are so depressed that upstream companies are likely to reduce output This could hurt volumes for midstream companies The same goes for weak enduser demandWhile I cannot make the case that midstream companies are without risks they come with a great riskreward given high average dividend yields and above all very wide moat business models After all its extremely expensive to build a pipeline and terminal networkOnce companies have a network in place they quickly turn into cash cows is such a companyThis company may be one of the best in the business It has a history of stock price outperformance a toptier balance sheet loads of free cash flow thanks to a mature business model a juicy yield and a moat that can be seen from spaceIn this article Ill walk you through my thoughts as I make the case that EPD is among the best highyield midstream companies money can buyAs one of Americas largest pipeline and terminal operators EPD isnt unbiased However it makes a compelling case for a strong future of fossil fuelsFor example EPD makes the case that energy usage is essential to improve the UN Human Development Index This index covers life expectancy education and economic wealthAs we can see in the overview below the higher the Human Development Index the higher the demand for energyWhile at some point energy efficiency becomes key as more energy doesnt improve the Human Development Index anymore between roughly 150 and 200 Gigajoules per capita its fair to say that the development of economies is based on energy demandIts why coal production was so important during the industrial revolution as it allowed the US and other Western nations to start building wealthy economies While were now at a point where renewables are increasingly important our wealth is built on coal oil and gasHence EPD puts a big question mark in the chart below as theres no way we can achieve Paris Climate Agreement targets in a scenario where the global population growth until 2050 is expected to be 18 billionIn light of these developments the United States is the place to be The United States enjoys some of the biggest oil and gas reserves in the world a massive infrastructure network allowing it to produce and export these reserves and stocklisted companies that allow investors to benefit from thisLooking at the chart below oil gas and related liquids production is expected to see consistent growth albeit at lower growth rates compared to prepandemic levels Thats why Im also bullish on upstream but thats something well discuss in another articleAdditionally the US will be an increasingly important export nation for crude oil natural gas ethane LPG and relatedEPD has highlighted domestic demand versus total supply in the charts below Note that by 2030 the US will also be able to boost LNG liquid natural gas exports to more than 40 billion cubic feet per day In 2021 that number was 11 billionHaving said all of this rising energy production higher export demand and longterm tailwinds for fossil fuels are fertile ground for EPDFounded in 1968 EPD is one of the oldest MLPs in the United States With a market cap of 58 billion its also one of the biggestIn this case its age is a huge advantage The company is mature which means it has an established network of pipelines and terminals without the requirement to spend a lot on growth capital expendituresWhen dealing with midstream companies I usually advise people to go with mature companies as these are often able to pay dividends without having to borrow moneyLooking at the map below we see that the company has a network of more than 50000 miles of pipelines more than 260 million barrels of storage 20 deep water docks 30 natural gas processing plants and 26 fractionatorsOver the past 12 months EPD spent 27 billion on capex This is a combination of growth and maintenance capexThis number has been wellbelow prepandemic levels when the company had to consistently invest more in its business to grow itNow it benefits from strong and rising operating cash flow from past growth investments and subdued investment requirementsBefore 2017 the company didnt generate a lot of free cash flow Now its generating more than 4 billion in annual free cash flowThis number is expected to gradually increase to 65 billion by 2025 which would translate to more than 11 of its market capAs a result of these qualities the company has a 30x leverage ratio which is extremely healthy Hence it has an ABaa1 credit rating one of the best ratings in the industryFurthermoreFurthermore unlike many peers that had to cut their dividends when a toxic mix of falling energy prices and high capex needs hit them in 20152016 EPD has hiked its dividend for 25 consecutive yearsAlso looking at the numbers below the company has a wellcovered dividend and selffunded capex Its now a healthy cash cow with tremendous dividend potential thanks to an expected doubledigit free cash flow yield after 2024These qualities have also allowed EPD to outperform its peers Over the past 10 years EPD shares have returned 71 including dividends The Alerian MLP ETF  returned just 7When looking at our rating tracker we see that the company enjoys the highest quality score in the industry which is no surprise given what we have discussed so farValuation wise were dealing with an attractive opportunityThe company is trading at 89x 2024E EBITDA which is based on its market cap roughly 10 billion in minority interest income streams it doesnt fully own 275 billion in expected net debt and 97 billion in potential EBITDAThis valuation is attractive as EPD tends to trade close to 10x EBITDAThis would give the company a fair value 18 above the current unit priceThe current consensus price target is 32 which is 20 above the current price making my outlook a consensus outlookHaving said all of this I expect EPD to outperform most of its peers on a prolonged basis The company has the perfect lowrisk business model strong demand and supply tailwinds a healthy balance sheet selffunded operations and a wellcovered dividendOn top of that its juicy 75 yield comes with a great valuation making EPD a terrific tool for incomeseeking investorsEnterprise

224,"CVR Partners: 33% Dividend Yield, Breakout Appears Imminent",CVR Partners LP  is a company that focuses on creating nitrogenbased fertilizers such as ammonia that is currently paying a 20 percent dividend yield I know what you might be thinking A company that pays over a 20 percent dividendBut before you write off CVR Energy due to its hefty dividend you might want to dig deeper to see if this 20 percent dividend is too good to be trueBefore we do that lets examine a brief  The story began in 1893 with a farmer from Southwest Missouri named Howard Cowden As a farmer he began a cooperative to help farmers gain pricing power Fast forward andThen in 1944 CCA bought an oil refinery in Coffeyville Kansas The Coffeyville refinery was originally built and owned by the National Refining Company NRC which traced its roots back to 1882 when JI Lamprecht from Cleveland built the refinery for keroseneIn 1966 CCA rebranded itself to Farmland Industries and its management began to try to grow the company aggressively On May 31 2002 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which was the largest agricultural coop bankruptcy in American history One reason it went bankrupt was that it was in the middle of constructing a fertilizer plant in Coffeyville Kansas next to its petroleum refinery This bankruptcy was thanks to the plant experiencing difficulty operating correctly after its launch in 2000Having a fertilizer plant next to a refinery was supposed to make sense on paper as each ton of ammonia produced would require 118 tons of petroleum coke and the Coffeyville refinery was able to produce over half the 500000 short tons of coke the new nitrogen plant would need This should have created strong synergies between the refinery and the fertilizer plant but it was not operating well enough for the company to avoid bankruptcyThis fertilizer plant which would one day become a keystone asset of CVR Partners had cost Farmland 300 million to build but its interest in the plant was sold in March 2004 to a company owned by Pegasus Capital Advisors a Connecticutbased private equity fund for just 11 millionPegasus Capital Advisors sold the Coffeyville refinery and fertilizer plant just a year later on July 12 2005 to Coffeyville Acquisitions LLC which was a partnership between Goldman Sachs  private equity arm and the funds of Kelso Partners a major private equity player founded in 1971In April 2011 Coffeyville Acquisitions LLC was ready to take the company public in the midst of a strong fertilizer market that had rebounded from the 2009 recession Since April 2011 CVR Partners has operated as a publicly traded MLPAs described above CVR Partners main asset is its Coffeyville Kansas facility And in addition to that is its East Dubuque Illinois facility The yellow lines on the map below indicate rail lines that allow these two plants to transport their product to most states west of the Mississippi Most important is the fact that these two plants operate in the corn belt which is where most of the demand for nitrogen fertilizer comes fromCVR Partners focuses primarily on nitrogenbased fertilizers such as ammonia Here we can see that broadly speaking the United States is the  of nitrogen fertilizers behind China and India has remained very steady over the past decade and with the worlds population continuing to grow in many pockets of the world demand should only increase The chart below demonstrates how nitrogen fertilizer demand has jumped since 2020 and 2021The following three slides are provided courtesy of Here we see that North Americas population is projected to remain steady for the next decade or so while populations in developing regions such as Asia and Africa are projected to explode higher I would take projections like these with a grain of salt and expect them to fall short of the actual population Nonetheless these population booms in Africa and Asia wont have a direct impact on North American food demand but with the world being more global they will unquestionably have an indirect impactThis following chart maps out the arable land person and demonstrates two things If you want to own land then you better buy some Perhaps that is a better investment than shares in a fertilizer company However more related to this article and CVR Partners LP is that in order to produce greater amounts of food for a growing population larger quantities of fertilizer will be needed to create higher yieldsAccording to the IMARC Group global fertilizer demand is going to grow almost 4 compounded annually through 2027 And so there shouldnt be a dropoff in demand for fertilizer in the foreseeable futureThrough 2022 the company continued to see a strong environment for their business Sales volumes are not necessarily increasing however their margins are in the form of higher prices for their product We can see this in the dramatic increase in Ammonia pricing compared to a more modest price increase in their inputs Natural Gas and Petroleum CokeCorn Stocks have declined in the past couple years which indicates that it is likely that more farm acres are going to be planted to corn in the coming years As I have already pointed out more corn acres being planted means greater demand for CVRs productsAs the slide below says 2021 demonstrated an inflection point in their business where farmers economics improved which resulted in higher demand for their product Management sees this trend continuing into the immediate futureThe company has maintained a fairly consistent balance sheet ratio The business circumstances of 2020 and 2021 caused the company to have its debttoasset ratio increase but since then it has begun to bring that ratio back downThe company operates as an MLP and so most MLPs have balance sheets that have higher ratios of leverage than other companies For example Magellan Midstream Partners which I just wrote about their  has a debttoasset ratio of over 75 percentHere is the history of the companys dividend yield It has maintained a flexible dividend policy as the profitability of the company fluctuated in more recent years The question regarding CVR Partners LP is will the demand for CVRs end product remain strong and will the inputs required to produce their product remain low In other words will this spread remain favorable for the company In 2022 we can see that based on the dividend paid the spread has remained favorable And thus far in 2023 the dividend has remained intactThe company reported solid results for the  This statement from the CEO Mark Pytosh summarizes the quarterDespite a decrease in the price of their product yearoveryear their financial results remained strong and the company was able to pay a 414 per share dividend for the quarter They were also able to increase production and sales volume thanks to great operating reliability How did the operating results as well as the dividend remain this strong when prices for their product were decreasingThis was because natural gas prices one of their input costs decreased from 8 per Mbtu down to just over 2 per Mbtu See the chart belowCVR Partners LP can be very tempting due to its very attractive dividend yield But before we decide to chase the dividend what are the charts telling us Thankfully for bullish investors the chart is also looking very bullish at the moment The chart is in the process of completing what appears to be a bullish flag pattern Traditionally if this is a bull flag pattern once the pattern has been completed the price should continue climbing about the length of the flagpole on the flag This isnt an exact science but rather just a rule of thumbAnd if the dividend remains intact over the next few years then there isnt any reason why CVR Partners couldnt double in price to adjust for the strong dividend Although nobody can see the future my expectation is that the market will be forced to realize the value of CVR Partners and that the share price will grow so that the dividend yield is more in line with other traditional MLP yields I see the scenario where dividend yields decrease due to profitability decreasing as the more unlikely scenarioI believe the biggest risk that CVR Partners faces is twofold Will there be another event like the pandemic that crashes share prices Very unlikely in the near future And second will the supply of materials that goes into making ammonia and other nitrogenbased fertilizers see price increases This is only a bad thing if there isnt also a comparable price increase in CVRs end product These prices dont always move in lockstep but if demand for energy increases it is also probable that food prices will increase as wellIf MLP equity investing is a strategy that you like then there may not be a more attractive MLP worth investing in at this moment I think the broader market could experience some weakness going into early or midOctober which may be shortly followed with a breakout in CVR Partners from its technical bullflag patternBased on projections from different organizations the foundation for global and national demand for fertilizer is likely to increase keeping demand for CVR Partners products high Should CVR Partners experience a technical breakout in price I would watch closely for what charts continue to do and would keep a close eye on global supply and demand dynamics as well as prices for the companys input costs   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to

225,TLT Could Be A Winner Even Without A Soft Landing,Stock and bond returns have dramatically separated over the last 18 months While the bond market has priced in an overheating economy with high shortterm growth with lower longterm growth ie inverted 2s10s yieldI think in the long run this dislocation is unsustainable and willTwo of my core tenants for initiating any investment which I outlined in my original article  are A dont fight the global liquidity cycle and B make trades congruent with the economic outlook for the next 18 months Funny enough this article was written almost exactly 1 year ago  over that time the SP 500 is up 13 and TLT is down by 95 total return Unfortunately the market over that time has behaved in a predictably irrational pattern pricing in a bestcase scenario soft landing for stocks while pricing in sustained longterm inflation for bonds On a probabilistic list of outcomes this would be one of the least likely outcomes and the Fed itself has forecast a The chart above from the Felder Report shows the divergence between fed liquidity and market performance with the red dashed line at the end estimating liquidity dynamics over the next several months due to TGA balance needing to be replenished and fed tightening continuing at its scripted rate This chart by itself makes me extremely wary of risk assets and should be at the center of every investors mind As liquidity tightens  cash is king and investments in risk assets should be heavily scrutinized Combine this with tightening lending standards at the commercial banks and a restrictive credit cycle  the liquidity environment is not favorable Obviously you could argue this is bad for treasuries too I discuss this in the risks sectionBloomberg economists are predicting negative real GDP growth over the next twelve months  obviously economists projections like Fed projections should be taken with a grain of salt but combined with falling leading indicators should also weigh heavily on investors minds as they consider the economic outlook for the next several months As the credit cycle continues to roll over the highly levered US economy will struggle to sustain positive output growth  ignore the credit cycle at your own perilThe stock market has not been as healthy as the large rally over the past 12 months would suggest Gains have been highly concentrated among the Magnificent 7 tech stocks particularly for the NASDAQ and the impact can been seen in the divergence in performance between the equalweighted indices vs the standard index Im not sure anyone could convince me that 60x PFCF is a fair price to pay for these stocks no matter how high the quality and growth If these companies were to produce 60x the cash flow they currently produce their output would rival many countries Its unreasonable to assume that companies this big will continue to grow at rapid rates if not purely for antitrust concerns If valuations on these stocks meanrevert this would produce tremendous pressure on the entire stock market given the concentration of these stocks in major indexesA chart I saw that really stood out to me as a strong latecycle indicator is the SPX EPS  NIPA Profits going back to 1970 NIPA profits represent income from current production and are reported to the BEA for economic analysis These profits can be thought of as real or current output vs accounting EPS earnings which can be influenced over the short term by management teams The idea is that in periods of declining economic activity but before the bottom falls out management teams pull forward profits to the current period to bolster flailing earnings However this can only go on so long before the rubber meets the road and economic reality sets in causing accounting profits to mean revert and often flip to a negative ratio with NIPA profits during recession This indicator is extremely reliable in predicting recessions as you can see from the chart above and we are now at levels only seen previously 3 times since 1970 Even if there is not a recession simple mean reversion of this ratio will put pressure on EPS across the board and should promote a more fearful  cautious environment in the stock market which should be beneficial for treasury securitiesAnother chart which I think is significant in assessing the current state of the cycle is the consumer excess savings chart above from JPM The bank estimates that there are only 02T of excess savings left from COVIDera stimulus While total savings are still at relatively normal levels these savings are concentrated in the top 10 of wealthiest individuals in the US As the bulk of Americans run out of excess savings the demand impulse should continue to decrease  The labor market has been strong over the past 18 months but job openings have slowed and payroll gains have been in a consistent downtrend exposing cracks in the labor marketAuto and credit card delinquencies have  again highlighting some weakness in the consumer balance sheetFinally Ill end with some quotes from the latest Dallas Fed manufacturing survey which I believe are particularly harrowing as the narrative has shifted away from complaints about input costs and labor and towards softening consumer demand If this softening demand materializes in a broad scale across the economy then the current economic expansion will end quickly as lately its almost entirely been driven by consumption TLT   has underperformed dramatically since the Fed began hiking rates last April Looking at the total return performance table the recent underperformance has been so sharp that its dragged the 5year performance negative This is pretty astounding when you think about it  what is essentially the longest duration riskfree rate has a negative total return over the last five years demonstrating that no asset is truly riskfree keep in mind this is a nominal return not an inflationadjusted returnThe longterm Treasury bond yield chart is one of the most important charts in all of finance  its indicative of a number of macro trends which define the era we live in Aging workforce decline in productivity and labor force participation sluggish growth lack of innovation and perhaps most importantly uniformly dovish monetary policy which has encouraged low rates for the last 40 years Obviously there have been intermittent periods of rising rates but overall these brief periods barely stand out on this chart apart from the current cycle which broke one of the longterm downward channels red lines on the chart I would consider this a capitulation event and this early in the cycle this is a gift from the market gods An opportunity for a savvy and soberminded investor who understands that the world is not ending to reinvest in one of the best performing asset classes of the past 2 generations Opportunities like this do not appear often and what makes this even more compelling is the asymmetry of the tradeBuy when there is blood in the streets  the classic value mantra applies here as the bond market has become overly pessimistic both on inflation and growth outlook As Ive discussed above inflation is likely to be stickier than the Fed and most market participants are hoping but I also believe that the economy is in its most overheated state currently and will likely begin to slow in the coming months which will send rates lower However even if Im wrong on my economic outlook and trades should never be made on economic outlook alone   and the economy does obtain a soft landing with cooling inflation this will also result in lower rates unless of course the economy emerges  than before and rate are permanently higher to compensate but that outcome is also unlikely given the demographic and longterm macro dynamics at play in the US economyFurthermore I like how the 30year has been in a relentless march upwards despite cooling inflation a FED who appears to be tapped out on interest rate hikes or at least close to it and some early signs of an economic slowdown The bond market is so fearful that it refuses to allow for any optimism and despite the 30yr being mostly flat for the year it has made a 50 BPS surge over the past 3 months while the stock market has been mostly flat This divergence in return will almost certainly mean revert  risk premiums have been  over time and a large sustained divergence in stock and bond performance is unlikely perhaps impossibleThe main risk to this trade particularly in the short term in my opinion is the imbalance in supply and demand in the treasury market The TGA remains relatively depleted and the US Treasury estimates that issuances will increase substantially heading into the end of the year This fear of supplydemand imbalance has fueled the treasury selloff for the last few monthsIts a little hard to predict quarterly changes in treasury issuance Ultimately the CBO projects the deficit to increase over the coming 10 years as social security Medicare and Medicaid spending growth outpaces growth in tax receipts In general this will put pressure on the treasury market in the absence of QE to soak up the excess supply A I think most of this fear is priced in and B I highly doubt the Fed will allow the treasury market to implode given the implications for financing the US government and on the broader economy While the Fed is not mandated to stabilize the treasury market look at their actions since the GFC  theyve been mostly committed to buying treasuries over this time period and I imagine they will return to form as quickly as possible The US economy cannot afford massively higher rates on such a large debt balance and I feel comfortable betting on the rates mean reverting closer to preCOVID levels Obviously no trade is truly risk free and if rates stay higher for longer it will limit the upside of this trade However even in that case you can lock in an attractive yield at current rates which limits the downsideIn conclusion the treasury bond market has deviated substantially in performance from the stock market over the past 18 months Historically these deviations tend to mean revert and given the longterm trend towards lower rates since the 70s I believe rates will continue to trend lower even if they dont get back to the precovid lows Buying TLT is asymmetric due to the high yield currently and worst case can clip a strong coupon if rates stay at current levels   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or

226,Navios Maritime Partners: Buy For Strong Fundamentals And Potential Upside,Navios Maritime Partners  deals in owning and operating tanker vessels and dry cargo It provides shipping services mainly in Asia Europe and America The company has recently reported its strong quarterly results and I believe it can sustain thisNMM is a global company that owns and operates tanker vessels and dry cargo The majority of the companys revenue is earned by charging customers for the use of its vessels to transport their dry liquid and containerized goods These seaborne shipping services are offered under longterm charters Its business is geographically diversified in  and each of the geographic regions contributes 6340 2290 and 1365 respectively to the companys total revenue The companys portfolio consists of 175 vessels diversifiedThe company has experienced a slight decrease in revenue in the period of pandemic as its revenue has decreased 518 YoY in FY2019 compared to FY2018 The pandemic negatively affected the seaborne trade activities However since FY2021 the company has experienced higher tanker rates than its longterm averages because of solid supply and demand fundamentals which is also reflected in its financial performance of FY2021 The company has reported revenue of 71318 million in FY2021 which is 2145 growth compared to 22677 million in FY2020 It has managed to sustain this solid growth in FY2022 as well and reported 121 billion which is 697 YoY growthThe seaborne trade activities were impacted after the pandemic and later it experienced a hurdle to rebound the growth as a result of inflationary pressures and geopolitical issues However the scenarios are gradually changing in 2023 Though the growth has not surpassed the prepandemic levels it is still steady The tanker business highly depends on the global oil demand Economic growth is said to drive the oil demand as they are  According to a recent projection by the IMF world GDP can rise by  and 3 in 2024 The oil demand is also anticipated to grow as marine trade activities for one of the major dry commodities such as  is estimated to grow by 2 in China and 3 in Europe All these positive growth factors have created opportunities for the participants Identifying these opportunities the company has planned and completed some acquisitions of vessels to expand its capabilities It has taken delivery of three newbuilding Capesize vessels Recently in August it also agreed to acquire one Kamsarmax vessel for 280 million which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter In addition the company has also agreed to execute the acquisition of two newbuilding Japanese MR2 product tanker vessels These vessels are expected to be delivered between 2026 to 2027 I believe this expansion can significantly increase the revenue of NMM as it helps the company in the accommodation of larger cargo volumes and facilitates it to capture the growing demand by creating capacity for additional shipping contracts As per my analysis this growth might be sustained for a longer period as a result of a rise in energy trade and population growth which can boost trades of essential commoditiesThe company recently reported its quarterly results It reported revenue of 34693 million up 2361 compared to 28066 million in Q2FY22 This growth was mainly fueled by to expansion of the fleet and a marginal increase in the Time Charter Equivalent TCE rate The company has managed to beat the markets revenue expectations by 2894 million or 91 Net income dropped by 495 YoY from 11816 million to 11230 million The decrease in net income was driven by a rise in time charter voyage expenses and rise in debt The decreased net income resulted in an EPS of 365 However the company has managed to surpass the markets EPS consensus by 077 or 267 NMM reported 27005 million in liquidity and adjusted EBITDA stood at 2016 millionThe firm managed to perform well despite the macroeconomic pressures which reflects its resiliency I believe the company can sustain this growth in the future as the  confirmed that supply  demand fundamentals are intact and the company is continuously focused on expanding its capabilities which can help it to capitalize on the growing opportunities According to Seeking Alpha the companys revenue might be 130 billion which is 744 YoY growth After considering the rising seaborne trade activities and supply  demand fundamentals I think Seeking Alphas revenue estimate is accurate The companys 3year average net income margin is 30 I believe NMM can maintain the net income margin of 30 in the coming period as the management has confirmed that the supply  demand fundamentals are still intact Therefore I am estimating a net income margin of 30 for FY2023 which gives an EPS of 1267The companys debt has increased significantly in the last few years Its longterm debt was 7634 in Jun 2023 which is 234 growth compared to Dec 2020 NMMs 36 debt has a fixed interest rate of 56 while the other 64 has a floating interest rate of 78 The companys large part of the companys debt is subject to changes in market interest rates Currently the interest rates are rising in the market to counter the rising inflation Therefore if the interest rates continue to rise in the coming period it can significantly affect the companys net income marginsChina is one of the prominent markets for the company as it imports large quantities of raw materials from other countries and exports significant amounts of semifinished and finished goods For instance in 2022 China imported iron ore of 1093 billion tons which represented approximately 74 of the international marine iron ore trade It also contributed 19 to the global marine coal movements in 2022 If the levels of imports and exports decrease due to changes in the countrys economic policies it can negatively impact the companys charter business and reduce its profit marginsThe oil demand is highly interlinked with global GDP growth The world GDP and oil demand are estimated to grow decently in 2023 which can create significant opportunities for the shipping industry I believe the companys plans to expand its vessels through acquisitions can accelerate its growth by helping it serve a large number of customers and capture the growing demand in the marketAfter considering all the above factors and revenue  net income margin estimates I am estimating EPS of 1267 for FY2023 which gives the forward PE ratio of 168x The companys forward PE ratio of 168x is 903 lower compared to the  NMMs primary competitors are       and   as all of them offer marine transportation and have market capital in the same rangeThe companys forward PE ratio of 168x is 764 lower compared to the industry average PE ratio of 711x The comparison of forward PE ratio of NMM with industry average and sector median PE ratio indicates the company is significantly undervaluedI believe the company might grow in the coming quarters as a result of positive demand in the industry and intact supply  demand fundamentals which can help it to trade at industry average PE ratio as according to mean reversion theory PE ratio has tendency to trend back to average PE ratio Therefore I estimate the company might trade at an industry average PE ratio of 711x in the coming period giving the target price of 9008 which is a 324 upside compared to the current share price of 2123NMM has performed solidly in the second quarter despite macroeconomic pressures The industry has various supportive growth factors which can help demand to remain stable for a longer period and NMMs current expansions of its vessels can help it cater to growing demand However it is exposed to risk of fluctuations in imports and exports of China and rising interest rates which can contract its profit margins The stock is undervalued and we can expect significant growth from the current price levels as a result of rising sectorspecific global opportunities and its expansion of vessels Considering all the above factors I assign a buy rating to NMM   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is

227,A Trillion-Dollar Black Swan Right Under Our Nose,Since bottoming back in October markets have rallied to the surprise of many investors After a few red days in a row the bears are back out from hibernation and even the famous Michael Burry is openly While subscribing to theories of imminent collapse has been historically a losing trade Id like to propose a theory for just that todayI see a lot of similarities between stocks today and stocks in 1987 a year that featured both a 40 rally and a 35 collapse Black MondayWeve already seen the 35 rally is a drawdown coming next Some very specific features sparked the massive selloff in October 1987 and some of these are certainly present todaySpecifically 0DTE options are now a trilliondollar market which could send stocks into a doom spiralWhat1987 was definitely a fun year for investors After a good year of sideways movement US stocks really began to take off From January to September the SP 500 rallied close to 40Great start to the year but spirits would soon be crushed After selling off close to 10 from its highs the stock market literally collapsed on Monday October 19 1987 The SP would end up falling back towards 200 points interestingly finding support at the 200week MAThe worldwide losses are estimated to have been close to 17 trillion and this selloff By November of that same year the market would bottom and never look backNow lets look at some other variables to put this crash into context and try to understand what was going on at the timeIn the chart above we can see the SPX the Dollar Index  in purple inflation in yellow the unemployment rate in orange and the Fed funds rate in blueA couple of notable things to point out Firstly employment is doing well This selloff had nothing to do with a recession as we saw the market collapse while unemployment levels were decreasingSecondly inflation though volatile and a bit higher than what we were used to before COVID was for the most part under controlOvervaluations in the stock market are an easy answer Stocks had run nearly 40 and gotten ahead of themselves that much seems obviousHowever a lot of economists point towards monetary factors to explain this collapse So lets focus now on the DXY the Plaza Accord and the Louvre AccordAs we can see the dollar index had been weakening since 1985 This might well have contributed to the rally and was no accident Through the Plaza Accord the major economies of the world agreed to depreciate the dollar which had reached very high levels following the Volcker Fed administrationThis all changed however after the Louvre accord which aimed to stabilize the value of the dollar However notice that the dollar did not immediately stabilize and in fact kept grinding downThere are a couple of things to take away from this Firstly we can see that the Fed started raising rates following the Louvre accord which could be described as bad for stocks What might have even been a bigger contributor to the 1987 selloff though is the fact that the dollar failed to stabilize as quickly as some expectedThis policy failure increased uncertainty in the market and also the likelihood of further monetary tightening down the road which we did indeed seeWhile it is hard and some might even say impossible to pinpoint the exact reasons that triggered the market selloff there seems to be at least some consensus on what made things worseIn short portfolio insurance and programmatic trading played a big rolePortfolio Insurance was developed in 1976 and became very popular leading up to the 1987 crash The idea behind this was quite simple and it was a matter of using stoploss orders in order to prevent huge losses Remember this was over 30 years ago and it was quite a novel concept at the timeWhat was not foreseen though was how these automatized portfolio insurance could create a selffulfilling feedback loop of doomSource Too many sellers and not enough buyers Pretty straightforward supply and demand dynamics playing out right in front of our eyesThe big question is could this happen today Lets compare the variables we looked at in 1987 with what we have todayThough not quite as strong as in 1987 weve had a pretty good start to the year with the SP up over 20 since JanuaryThis has been accompanied by a controlled cooling of inflation and also a depreciating dollar Unemployment is near historic lows and we have just witnessed one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in historyConditions are not exactly the same but there are some similarities Yes stocks especially the Nasdaq  have run a lot this year and we could make an argument that a lot of them are overvaluedThe US economy like in 1987 seems strong but this doesnt mean we cant sell off In fact it might be the complacency with this seemingly strong economy that could lull investors into a false sense of securityWith that said more tightening seems unlikely as we should be nearing a pause However this could change if inflation remains sticky an argument that Ive made beforeLastly in terms of the US dollar its hard to know where we are going to land Exchange rates arent thought of like they were back in the 1980s and there is a lot less policy targeting it but I do see a resemblance between today and 1987 Theres certainly a lot of uncertaintyA lot of currencies have come under pressure in the last few months The Yen has been making headlines as the BoJ tries to scrap its YCC policy The Chinese Yuan has hit a  after the PBOCs rate cut and of course the British Pound had a rough start to 2023While Im still not sure how all of this could pan out lets just say this opens up the room to surprises Maybe the Fed is forced to tighten more as the dollar falls or the dollar strengthens too much and takes a toll on the economyAny of these issues could spark a quick selloff and the quick selloff could become a 20 down day thanks to 0DTE optionsSo what are 0DTE optionsSource Any option that expires on the same day is a 0DTE option and while technically these have traded for a while they become a lot more prominent in the last year In 2005 weekly options were issued by the CBOE which allowed traders to use 0DTE options once a week However as of 2022 there are now 0DTE options on SPX futures available for all trading days0DTE options offer high leverage and flexibility and this might be why they have become so popular How popular you askAccording to this chart 0DTE options set a new record on August 11th representing over 50 of all the volumeThis would represent a notional value of over 1 trillion as   and could lead to a 20 decline given the right circumstancesSource Note that this analysis was made back in March and the effect could be even greater now that 0DTE options are even more popularJust like in 1987 0DTE options threaten to exacerbate a market selloff by creating unforeseen downward momentumA 20 selloff from here would take us back towards 3800 in the SPX almost retesting the previous lows With that said the 200 weekly MA offers some strong support at 3900 and its worth remembering that this was where the market reversed back in 1987All in all while I have laid out the potential for slightly higher highs in the coming months downside risk has definitely increased and the popularization of 0DTE options

229,The Tesla Dilemma: Juggling Growth And Competition, stock still offers investors lots of upside potential the carmaker continues to defend some of the best technology in electric vehicles or EVs on both production efficiency and product features in addition the Tesla brand remains the However reflecting on the latest developments in the global EV market it becomes also evident that the Austinbased automotive company faces multiple challenges in its road to EV domination In this article I will discuss my take on Teslas i latest Model 3 launch ii the broader price cuts price war and the iii changing market shareOverall while I continue to defend the position that Tesla remains one of the most exciting growth assets listed on the market I also understand that the goldilocks days of easy growth notablyIn context of the Munich IAA mobility event held from September 5th to 10th Tesla unveiled a new generation of its bestselling Model 3 car On the design angle the new Model 3 sports updated bumpers and lighting as well as a somewhat revised interior With regard to performance specs the rearwheel drive Model 3 has a 062 mph 0100 kmh acceleration time of 61 seconds and a WLTP range of 319 miles 513 km The Dual Motor Long Range variant is even more impressive with a 44second 062 mph 100 kmh time and a WLTP range of 391 miles 629 km Both versions offer fast charging capabilities of 170 kW or 250 kW providing up to 175 miles 282 km of range in just 15 minutes when the battery is depletedIn my opinion the new Model 3 launch is notable because it is a welcome alternation in the carmakers strategy to fuel demand by simply cutting prices With the new Model 3 Tesla may once again point with car buyers on product excitement vs price excitement By the way somehow Teslas Model 3 update reminds me of Apples  strategy with relaunching the iPhone over and over again with minor tweaks Tesla plans to sell the new Model 3 as early as 2024 And overall early management commentary suggests that the new product my help to improve profitability by both lowering the cost of goods sold and increasing the selling price compared to the outgoing modelTeslas new Model 3 launch is also important because Tesla needs to update its somewhat older product portfolio to remain competitive with European and Chinese carmakers who bring new models to the market at record pace In other words the times where Tesla was the only game in battery EV or BEV are over In fact in terms of global BEV sales and market share Teslas share now has dropped to only 15 down from about 23 for the previous yearHowever it is also important to note that the BEV market is still expanding rapidly which renders the loss of market share less concerning According to a research note by Morgan Stanleys equity research team  the global BEV sales in July 2023 YTD vs the same period in 2022 are up a remarkable 36 growing to 5075089 BEV units sold in 2023 so far The growing market is supported by higher penetration levels in all regions the US at 80 Europe at 159 and China at 228Finally while BYD Companys  17 market share has overtaken Teslas I would like to point out that Tesla is leading in the US and Europe while BYD is only leading in China which is a more price sensitive market although high volumeLooking beyond the new Model 3 excitement I see Teslas next growth leg supported by its nextgen vehicle platform which could account for 47 million EVs produced by 202830 according to my estimates For context the nextgen platform is Teslas most important hardware project right now aiming to reduce production cost and efficiency for more aggressive EV volume scale According to management guidance the nextgen platform will be leveraged at plants around the world and not only in Mexico as I have initially assumed The platform is expected to be used for the production of the Cybertruck Semi and Roadster as well as other future vehiclesMoreover as the second major growth opportunity Tesla continues to be working on FSD technology In that context Teslas ambitions are likely to accelerate over the next 12 to 24 months as the company is investing in AI and its Dojo supercomputer project As an additional consideration when discussing FSD I would also like to point out that Tesla has recently reduced the price of its FSD package from 15 tsd to 12 tsd which could likely push adoption up by anywhere between 10 to 20 I believe But more data points are needed to see how penetration and gross profit maximization is optimized by price adjustments in FSD Like in its pricing strategy for vehicles Tesla is lately experimenting a lot with pricing Thus pricing on FSD may continue to evolve over the next few months and personally I would not be surprised if the starter package drops below the five figure benchmarkI see a challenging Q3 for Tesla In my opinion there could be downside risk to investors expectations for volume and margin reflecting planned summer production shutdowns which will push both production and deliveries down while repeated aggressive discounts on sales may limit profitability Specifically Tesla has recently estimated that both production and deliveries volume will likely be down in Q3 vs Q2 mostly driven by the discussed factory shutdowns around the globe In that context the company had about 16 days of sales in inventory in Q2 mostly intransit vehicles which may not be enough to offset the production impact from shutdowns happening in Q3Tesla has so far never voiced any doubts to hitting the 18 million in deliveries target But the data still suggests downside risk to the flattish deliveries consensus at present And if volume is met it might come at a considerable cost eg pressuring profitability on purchaseinducing price cuts In that context Tesla also intends to manage the delivery mix between the Model 3 and Model Y by adjusting the pricing gaps between the two models on a weekly basis for specific regions to tailor to marketspecific nuances on supply and demandThe manufacturing costs of Teslas Austin and Berlin factories are improving on volume ramp ups but overall scale effects are still well below Fremont at present However once Austin and Berlin reach more stabilized production levels they will be able to implement cost reduction efforts In my opinion however meaningful operating leverage from the BerlinAustin factory ramp will not materialize prior to 2024Regarding the Cybertruck Tesla reiterated that the company is on track for start of production and deliveries in Q4 with 250k in target annual capacity The vehicle is a product specific to the US market and management indicated that it is difficult to estimate how many Cybertrucks can be sold in 2023 and 2024 since it will also largely depend on the demand for its other vehiclesTesla continues to be an exciting investment opportunity However it is important to recognize the evolving landscape of the global EV market which presents both opportunities and challenges A few considerations stand out First the recent launch of an updated Model 3 focusing on product quality rather than price reductions indicates Teslas commitment to sustainable growth Second While Teslas global market share has dipped the overall EV market is expanding rapidly with Tesla maintaining leadership positions in the US and Europe Third investors should keep a close eye on Teslas nextgeneration vehicle platform and Full SelfDriving technology which hold the key to the companys future growthWhile I see a few potential challenges in the short term particularly in Q3 I advise investors to maintain a longterm perspective on Tesla and as long as the company maintains leadership in EV technology as well as customer love I recommend to remain investedEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks  not

230,Exxon Mobil: Take Some Profit Near All-Time High Prices,Readers familiar with our writings know that we have been longterm bulls on Exxon Mobil  We posted our first  on the stock back in Oct 2021 andFastforward to now all these drivers worked out really well The stock has delivered a total return of 100 since then see the chart below outpacing both the SP 500 Index and also the energy sectorHowever we see that all 3 driversXOM was able to maintain quite respectable profitability as measured by ROIC return on invested capital as shown in the chart below in the long term Its ROIC in the past decade averaged around 917 far better than its close rival Chevron  However due to a series of headwinds mostly the breakout of the COVID pandemic and oil price fluctuations its ROIC nosedived into the negatives toward the latter half of 2021And our bull thesis started when we saw signs of its profitability turning a corner as shown in the chart below At that time our thinking was that travel would recover and the RussianUkraine situation would lead to a supplydemand imbalance both helping to stabilize energy prices and boost XOMs profitability Indeed XOMs profitability staged a perfect Vrecovery as seen shortly afterward Its profitability surged to about 25 ROIC in early 2023However its ROIC has since then pulled back a little bit to the current 214 I dont view this pullback as a random fluctuation I see it as a symptom of the changes in the underlying forces for several reasons First the pullback is also observed in other peers such as CVX Second and more important the supplydemand imbalance has largely equilibrated by now in my view as detailed immediately belowA few key factors kept supply and demand out of balance in the energy past for the past 23 years The top ones in my mind are A years of underinvestment in basic energy infrastructure B the breakout of the RussianUkraine war C the global shipping congesting limiting the shipment of LNG liquefied natural gas and D colderthannormal winter temperatures resulting in higher natural gas consumption than normal say the fiveyear period between 2017 and 2021All these factors have largely renormalized and found at least a temporary equilibrium point by now with the exception of D Weather is just weather and can always change randomly As a result you can see from the chart below that natural gas storage now sits above the historical average by a good margin For readers unfamiliar with this chart it shows the working natural gas inventory in the lower 48 states in underground storage The units are a billion cubic feet The grey area means the range  the difference between the max and min averaged over five years The thick blackgrey line is the running average And the thick blue line shows the current level As seen for the latter part of 2021 and throughout most of 2022 the inventory has been struggling below the average But starting early 2023 the inventory has been building up and stayed steadily above the averageCrude oil stock is still near a multiyear low see the second chart below However I anticipate its turning point is coming soon because of the changes in the fundamental forces mentioned above Trading at a TTM PE in the single digit 905x as of this writing the stock is still cheap comparatively amid an overall expensive market However its valuation no longer offers any meaningful margin of safety in my viewFor a cyclical business such as XOM which pays steady dividends in the long term the dividend is a much better measure of its economic earnings than accounting EPS As a result dividend yield is a much better valuation metric than PE in my view As shown in the chart below the stock was yielding about 58 when we started our bull thesis far above its historical average But now the situation is the opposite Its yield is not only below the historical average but also at the lowest level in at least 5 yearsThere are other considerations surrounding the stock both in the upside and downside directions Some of the upside catalysts include its clean energy initiatives which ought to ramp up and bear fruit in the long term I anticipate capital spending in the alternative energy arena notably renewable diesel fuels and hydrogen to accelerate in the years to come Management also controls costs effectively in the way I see things Through structural reorganization and operating efficiency improvement annual expenses have been lowered by 7 billion compared to 12 years ago Lastly as mentioned earlier its profitability as measured by ROIC is still at a very competitive level even if it pulls further back when compared to its own historical average or its close peersHowever my overall feeling is that the issues mentioned above will be the dominating forces in the near term say the next 23 years To recap its profitability has already reached a peak at least temporarily for the next few years The supplydemand imbalance seems to have found a new equilibrium From the supply side the sector has reinvested heavily in the past 23 years to boost production From the demand side the world was forced to either reduce consumption or find alternative sources as the RussianUkraine situation drags on As such XOM might still be a good investment in the long term all upside catalysts mentioned above are longterm oriented but I

231,What Affects The Price Of Gold: Conventional Wisdom Vs. History,People buy gold and silver for a lot of reasons For jewelry and adornment for numismatic coin collecting purposes to store wealth limited industrial applications to protect against inflation and to guard against geopolitical turmoil and related threats to fiat governmentissued currency As it relates to investing the list is narrowed theFirst it must be stated and underscored that there is nothing special about gold that makes it magically go up in value in response to inflation Gold is a commodity and like any other commodity its price rises and falls according to supply and demand dynamics with plenty of interference from gold futures speculation In other words the price of gold only goes up if people are willing to pay more for it And as inputs commodities tend to be the first to feel inflations powerBecause it has been repeated so often that gold protects purchasing power from the ravages of inflation it could be a classic instance of the tail wagging the dog When people hear that inflation is high or going to be high they flock to gold to protect their purchasing power thus driving the price of gold up That increase in price then makes it look like gold did indeed track with inflation but it wasnt the inflation that caused it It was people buying gold due to inflationary fears Its correlation but not causation There have been  where gold went down in spite of inflationIn other words trying to time the market and get in and get out of gold according to inflation reads and inflation expectations could result in considerable money lossHowever using gold as a store of value over extremely long periods of time could indeed achieve the desired result This chart explains it allWith notable periods of divergence gold and to a lesser extent silver have both kept pace with inflation But the problem with this is that we have instruments that allow us to  pace inflation with zero periods of divergence TIPS and Ibonds So gold and silver become lesser vehicles if matching inflation is the stated goal Another issue is that tracking with inflation via gold silver TIPS or Ibonds means that the real return is still 0 Purchasing power was maintained but wealth did not increase If you can use an asset that BEATS inflation why not use itGold and silver are nonproductive assets More than perhaps any other asset class the value of these is inherently tied to how much someone else is willing to pay for it Beyond limited use in industry and electronics gold is just a mineral Unlike stocks which represent proportional ownership of an entity that produces and can produce more of things that humans use need want and demand or real estate that serves a critical function to giving people a place to live work eat etc gold just sits there As Warren Buffett said sure you can fondle gold but dont expect it to respondIn summation for this portion yes precious metals can protect against inflation but only if they are held for the long term But maintaining purchasing power is a far lesser goal than actually building wealth so if you have to hold something for the long term anyway you might as well buy stocks or real estate whose returns smash gold and silverI am of the opinion that investing in precious metals for the inflation aspect alone simply isnt worth it If you want to match inflation buy TIPS or Ibonds Better yet beat inflation by investing in stocks and real estate for the long term However when coupled with a second factor allocating a modest portion of ones overall portfolio to precious metals makes senseLet me put it bluntly if something like World War III starts up and the United States loses our currency will almost certainly collapse With the Russian invasion of Ukraine the hot situation in Israel and Chinas objective of someday retaking Taiwan plenty of folks are prognosticating about an outbreak of widespread war involving major powers If the US does not win that conflict alongside allies dont count on being able to buy TIPS or Ibonds If things get especially bad dont count on your dollar bills being worth much more than the paper they are printed on That is the doomsday scenario a picture often painted by the gold bugsIn that scenario where a strong government doesnt exist to issue and back up a fiat currency silver and gold will be the likely fallback for a medium of exchangeAn  describes it well The US dollar isWar could easily upset the value proposition of the United StatesEven without a war or any doomsday scenario the US dollar is facing unprecedented challenges to its status as the worlds reserve currency This is due to the world becoming increasingly concerned about the US capacity to meet debt obligations alongside a rising China and other nations that would rather not bow to the dollar for settling global tradesAt a BRICS summit earlier this year BRICS  Brazil Russia India China South Africa this theme was  by several world leaders Russian President Vladimir Putin said The objective irreversible process of dedollarization of our economic ties is gaining momentum President Xi Jinping of China was recorded as promoting the reform of the international financial and monetary system If any such BRICS currency comes into being even a decade from now having gold and silver could very well act as a store of wealth insulated from any impact on the US dollar This is especially so if the rumors are true that any such BRICS currency would be backed by gold Its worth noting that the past two years have seen  by central banks of various nations the world overWhat happens to the price of silver and gold during periods of major conflict threats and socialeconomic unrest A few examplesLets start with the most recent first looking at a period that encompasses the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 indicated by the first and second red dots respectivelyYou could make the case that gold shot up in response to COVID commotion but you could also argue that the surge was simply a continuation of a previous bull trend that started two years earlier The Ukraine situation saw gold soon thenafter plummet by 19Next is The Great Recession which started in December of 2007 indicated by the red dotHere too the case could be made that the global shock resulted in a flight to the safety of gold where prices pushed up by 200 in a few short months However the surge was shortlived Before year end the price of gold had dipped below the recession start price then starting a slow march upward that matched the global economic recoveryNow we look at September 11th a day that changed the world The price of gold went up by 20 in the immediate aftermath but the settled back down quickly flattening for a few months and then slowly climbed through subsequent years If this amounts to a flight to safety it was cool and calculated More of a meander to safetyLooking at WWII where Germany invaded Poland in 1939 first red dot and then when Japan brought the United States into the conflict in 1941 second red dot both were in the midst of a significant fall in the price of gold Global unrest indeed but no surge in goldThe final example from the Great Depression certainly makes the strongest case for gold being a wise investment in instances of economic shock From 360 to 800 in just a couple yearsThis list was not intended to be exhaustive And it is certainly beyond the scope of this article to try and surmise fully why the price of gold behaved as it did in each given instance The point is that significant events by themselves dont seem to send gold in a particular direction Trying therefore to invest according to some potential doomsday event is an error if history is any indicator Its a mixed bagBut lets talk about an instance where there was no single shock to set things off but rather a series of smaller events and conditions combined to create a climate that may have contributed to the meteoric rise in the value of gold that happened in the 1970sFrom 280 to 2600 over ten years is a 25 annual growth rate What a decade What was going on that might explain some of the rise Some things that have plenty of resemblance to today Cold War with Russia Stagflation Oil embargo and subsequent energy crisis Iranian hostage situation with 60 US citizens taken Russias military posturing and invasion of Afghanistan Yom Kippur or 4th ArabIsraeli warEerie is it not Replace a few words or names and those bullets basically describe today None of those things individually had the same scope as WWII or the same shock as 911 but taken together they clearly pushed peoples investing dollars into a perceived safe haven gold of courseNow to be perfectly clear I am not predicting some meteoric rise in gold Far from Who knows what will or will not happen However it does underscore the importance of diversification among asset classes with an informed proportion of the portfolio sitting in precious metals more so perhaps in instances where many monetary and sociogeopolitical elements are in playI am no gold bug If I wanted to achieve one thing with this article it was the hope that I could dampen the voices of the firms trying to make a profit by using current circumstances and in my opinion using scare tactics to get people to buy precious metals There is simply no proof that gold reliably spikes as a result of inflation andor big global events That being said it is one basket in which folks should have an egg or two as part of a longterm strategy of preserving wealth Other baskets are realestate stocks bonds other commodities and perhaps even a dash of foreign currency No one knows what the future will bring on the US or global stage Therefore touching various asset classes is wise Limiting overt exposure to any single one is keyFear of missing out and fear of loss should not be drivers of investment decisions Data should drive investment decisions I hope I provided here data that could round out the picture a bit and prevent folks from doing anything drastic Buy gold and silver but do so in a measured way that agrees with your overall life situation and goals   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a

232,Unleashing NextEra Energy: Fast Dividend Growth And 30% Undervaluation,The other day I  Duke Energy  which is my only utility investment While it carries a 45 yield it has underperformed the market in the past ten years making it a good yield play but not aIn this article I want to shed some light on  the renewablesfocused regulated utility giant Headquartered in Florida its the oldest stocklisted utility as highlighted in the  belowDespite its age the company isnt boringOver the past ten years NEE shares have outperformed their utility peers dividend growth stocks and the SP 500 by a wide marginHowever the company is now in a downtrendNEE shares are down 18 yeartodate and roughly 25 below their alltimeWhile challenges like persistently sticky inflation and the odds of a prolonged hawkish Fed policy are doing a number on stocks with high debt loads and somewhat limited pricing power it also comes with opportunitiesNextEra Energy became a dividend aristocrat in 2021 when it hit its 25th consecutive annual dividend hikeCurrently the company has 27 consecutive hikes with an 113 compounding average dividend growth rate over the past five yearsWhile its dividend yield of 27 is somewhat subdued it is blowing its peers out of the water when it comes to dividend growthFurthermore the company maintains a 58 payout ratio which is below the sector median of 66So when it comes to its dividend scorecard the only drawdown is its dividend yield But then again it comes with higher growth and a lower payout ratioIn other words ignoring everything else buying NEE versus higheryielding peers depends on ones own goalsIf investors require income alternatives are almost an obvious choice Investors who arent dependent on income may want to opt for a stock with a higher total return potential  on top of high decent dividend growth with fantastic safety and consistencyWhile its stock price may not suggest it NEE is firing on all cylindersIn the first quarter the company achieved a remarkable 14 yearoveryear growth rate in adjusted earnings driven by new investmentsNote that the company saw strong growth despite weather headwinds which is impressive given how sensitive renewables are to weather headwinds pun intendedThe companys commitment to renewables and storage projects led to the addition of 1665 megawatts to its backlog which now totals around 20 gigawattsDespite challenges like commodity price inflation and supply chain disruptions Energy Resources remains stable as it believes that its significant pipeline of projects positions it well for meeting customer demandAdditionally Energy Resources is exploring opportunities in the green hydrogen market aiming to leverage its renewables expertise to support this emerging industryThis was also reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this yearAccording to the The company also benefits from strong growth in its key market Florida where employment and GDP growth are outperforming the nations averageExcluding changes related to weather and usage the companys customer base grew by 11 in the second quarter versus 2Q22 which is a fertile foundation for periods when individual power demand rises as wellTo deal with rising demand and investment in renewables FPLs Florida Power  Light capital expenditures in the second quarter were around 25 billion and the fullyear 2023 capital investment is projected to be between 85 and 95 billionFPLs strategy centers around solar investments with a goal of adding 3100 megawatts of solar through 2025According to the company emphasis addedAs these investments are expensive the companys net financial debt has exploded from 20 billion in 2010 to currently more than 70 billionBy 2025 net debt is expected to have exceeded 85 billionThe good news is that NEE isnt wasting money Investments in valueadding projects have caused EBITDA to grow consistently allowing the company to maintain a 4x leverage ratio for roughly 20 years as seen in the lower part of the chart aboveThis is a very healthy leverage ratio which explains why the company enjoys an A credit rating Thats one of the highest ratings in its industryNonetheless the fact that utilities have a lot of gross debt isnt helping them in an environment of elevated rates where borrowing is expected to remain expensive for a while Its why utilities usually perform poorly when inflation risesIn periods of lowfalling inflation NEEs stock does very wellNEE has a healthy balance sheet and despite high rates it continues to do well which is why I believe that weakness offers opportunitiesThanks to the recent stock price decline NEEs valuation has come down to earth The stock is now trading at 164x NTM EBITDA which has erased the entire postpandemic valuation expansionThe current consensus stock price target is 91 which is 30 above the current priceWhile I do not expect the stock to immediately start an aggressive uptrend I do agree with this target and believe that NEE is undervalued by at least 30NEE has an impressive track record of outperforming peers and indices for more than a decade backed by a remarkable 113 fiveyear average dividend growth rateWhile its current dividend yield may seem subdued its dividend growth potential and low payout ratio set it apartNEEs commitment to renewables and storage projects is evident in its backlog expansion totaling around 20 gigawatts Its exploration of the green hydrogen market supported by tax credits reflects a forwardlooking approachFueled by Floridas robust market and a strategic focus on solar investments NEE remains resilient despite its substantial debtA healthy leverage ratio and strong credit rating provide a foundation for successThe recent dip in valuation indicates an undervalued opportunity for investors in NEEWith a consensus target price of 91 NEE offers the potential for a 30 upside and longterm growth and stability in the sustainable

BDCs: A Lesson In Contrarian Investing,Some prefer real estate investment trusts REITs Others prefer business development companies BDCs I like owning bothOften the macroeconomic environment is supportive of both But sometimes economic conditions are good for one but bad for the other That makes them complementary assetsREITs and BDCs share in common the fact that they must both pay out at least 90 of their taxable income in order to avoid corporatelevel income taxes Instead of being doubletaxed  once at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level  these vehicles avoid corporate taxes in exchange for their dividends being taxed as ordinary income rather than the qualified dividend rateREITs and BDCs also share in common the basic business model of issuing capital a

onBut for the sake of this article the primary difference I want to highlight is the fact that REITs are  of debt some of which is floating rate while BDCs are  of debt almost all of which is floating rateAll else being equal rising interest rates are a  and a  while falling interest rates are a  and a But we should be a bit more specific because most of REITs debt is longterm 5 years in nature while most of BDCs loans have floating rates based on the shortestterm interest rate  the overnight rate set by central banksSo more specifically we can state that again all else being equal REITs benefit from falling longterm interest rates while BDCs benefit from rising shortterm interest ratesBoth are basically  but during rising interest rates that spread between WACC and investment yields typically narrows for REITs and widens for BDCs During falling interest rates the opposite typically happensWith that in mind take a look at the price performance of the broadbased Vanguard Real Estate ETF  against the VanEck BDC Income ETF  in the first several months of 2020 when COVID struck and incited a sharp drop in interest ratesDuring this time lower interest rates in addition to longer lease terms and an overrepresentation of financially strong tenants prevented REITs from falling as far as BDCsMeanwhile BDCs got hit by the doublewhammy of collapsing interest rates and a sudden economic shutdown that hurt many of their private middlemarket borrowers If the federal government had not stepped in to provide emergency lending and grants to these middlemarket businesses the damage would have been even worseThe situation so far this year could not be more different though The Federal Reserve has hiked their key policy rate aggressively pulling longterm interest rates up with it while the economy ie middlemarket borrowers and tenants alike has remained strongAs the market has realized that BDCs borrowers have mostly been able to absorb these higher interest costs and that BDCs have rewarded shareholders with dividend raises and special dividend payouts BDC total returns have begun to meaningfully outpace REITs this yearAgain the higher rates are a tailwind for BDCs and a headwind for REITsWe can see this even clearer when looking at examples of toptier BDCs against toptier REITs this year Here are my top five BDC holdings and top five REIT holdings And yes I know that one of these is a mortgage REIT but I view its business model as substantially similar to that of a BDC only concentrated on real estate companiesI like BDCs that are able to maintain a premium to their net asset values over time because this indicates an ability to issue capital for accretive investments on a regular basis The higher the premium to NAV the lower the cost of capital generally speakingOf course I like to buy these BDCs as close to NAV as possible or at a discount to NAV in those rare circumstances but the point here is that regularly trading at a premium to NAV is both an  and a  of quality It is the higher quality BDCs that tend to enjoy such a valuation premium in the first place and once they have that valuation premium they can use it to issue lowercost capital in order to win bids on loweryielding loans for higher quality borrowersMAIN is the textbook example of this which is why it is my largest BDC holding The company explicitly aims to increase its NAV per share over time along with its monthly dividendMeanwhile on the real estate side four of my five largest REITs primarily or exclusively employ net leases which are longterm contracts with fixed rental revenue streams and annual escalations rarely exceeding 34 They also employ longterm debt ranging from 5 to 30 years in length although most of them carry at least some floating rate debt on their balance sheets at timesThis year especially since the beginning of May the BDCs and ABR have significantly outperformed VNQ on a total return basisMAIN and ARCC the two largest and arguably most conservative BDCs in this group have understandably exhibited less volatility both on the downside and upside But they have also handily outperformed real estate so far this yearMeanwhile when comparing the five REITs against BIZD yeartodate we find the mirror oppositeAll year but especially starting in May REITs have significantly trailed BIZDCCI a telecommunications infrastructure REIT has performed the worst not only because of the 10 of its debt featuring floating rates but also because lease cancellations from the TMobile Sprint merger are taking a bite out of revenue growthARE the leading life science real estate owner and developer in the US has also suffered from investors mistakenly equating it with office buildings a drop in venture capital funding for biotechs and an activist REIT investors short reportFundamentally all five REITs continue to perform quite well but the higher cost of debt has spooked many investors out of the namesWhich is the better buy today for total returns over the next few yearsIf we had asked that question in March or April 2020 during a period of collapsing interest rates and extreme economic pain for private businesses the correct answer would have been BDCsDont believe me See for yourselfThat is because peak pessimism about BDCs even greater than the pessimism for REITs rendered phenomenal values for those stocksThe same holds for BIZD against the five in my opinion bestinclass REITs discussed above with the sole exception of VICIIn the initial stage of COVID19 VICI the Landlord of Las Vegas as I like to call it shed over half its stock price and market cap The very experiential inperson activities at VICIs casino properties were obviously severely curtailed by lockdowns and social distancing But this selloff also primed the REIT for a robust rebound as Las Vegas reopened and the world returned to normalYTD however BIZD has outperformed VICI as we saw aboveBut we cant invest by looking in the rearview mirror We have to invest by looking out the windshield No one can buy past returns only future performanceAs the famous quip goes Its difficult to make predictions especially about the futureBut in my view the much better bet to make today with ones scarce investable capital is on I think its plainly obvious that sentiment is much stronger for BDCs than it is for REITs In general investors are pessimistic about REITs and optimistic about BDCsBut this trend wont last forever To quote the father of value investing Benjamin GrahamIm not advocating selling BDCs Im a buyandholdqualitycompanies kind of guy and Im certainly not selling my highquality BDCs or ABR for that matter But I think REITs make the much better buy todayIt isnt just that the pendulum of investor sentiment has reached its end on its current path After all it is usually the case that something has to occur to  the pendulum stop and reverse courseThat something is the path of interest rates We are at or very near the top in interest rates not just by my own reckoning but by the projections of many experts The forward path of SOFR which is tied to the Fed Funds rate is forecast to begin dropping dramatically in 2024 and settle out sometime in 2026While I agree with these forward projections in a directional sense I dont at all buy the notion that rates will come down in a slow and controlled manner They never doLike stock prices the Fed Funds rate takes the escalator or stairs up during economic expansions and the elevator down during recessionsGoing back three decades the Fed has never been able to gradually lower their policy rate over the span of a few years The Fed has seemed to have three modes slam on the gas slam on the breaks or coastIf a recession comes sometime in the near future and especially if the highest interest rates in 15 years break something in the economy then interest rates will likely fall faster and lower than the expert projections indicateHistorically this is how it has worked out far more than the slow gradual lowering of rates currently envisionedIf the pattern of history plays out again this time or even if it doesnt and the expert predictions for a slow gradually downward drift of interest rates occur instead REITs should outperform BDCs over the next few yearsWhile I remain a fan of BDCs I view the five REITs discussed above as being uniformly better buys

opinionBelow we can look at a 15year graph of the gold prices vs changes in lease rates via GoldChartsRUScom I have drawn green arrows to point out the similarities between today and OctoberNovember

months and years for both gold bullion quotes and GDX total return performance The conclusion which is easy to reach past lease rate spikes have foretold of coming price gains usually large ones over timeDoes a lease rate spike lead to an immediate jump in gold prices The answer is not necessarily It could take a few weeks or months for the gold bull run higher to appear Thats what evidence over the last 15 years has proven However if you buy now and close your eyes ignoring daily fluctuations and news flow for 6 to 12 months I am quite confident gold bullion and gold miner pricing will be dramatically higher than todayThats exactly what the tight physical market setup is telegraphing for the future To find a better balance between supply and demand forces much higher quotes look to be necessary Bringing existing aboveground gold supplies to market through the profitmotive is how capitalism worksPart of the tightness in the physical bullion market is related to  around the world

235,Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),Over most of the past year I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads I  my longterm bullish take on MarathonHowever as discussed more recently  Ive downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash  in the crack spread As such it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon considering its stock remains generally high However its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopoliticalrelated production cuts Overall investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum depending on how we calculate its forward valuationFor the most part refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly My longterm view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today That said the shortterm outlook has changed as volatility mounts raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022 However oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around 87 per barrel today Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil  Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped Marathon has retained much of its value but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income The crack spread is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs crude oil has crashed particularly for the gasoline spread See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profitLuckily Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of 32barrel to 19barrel today That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above All else being equal this 12barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of 1296 annualized 324B quarterly  have only changed marginally over this period Natural gas has also hardly changed so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathons refining marginsThe company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023 However this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathons current EBITDA See belowHistorically Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around 15 depending on changes in other operating costs Today that spread is below its typical range before COVID19 indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around 15B per quarter from its Midstream segment In comparison its refining margins can vary from negative  seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage Its refining segment EBITDA was 316B in Q2 and may be as low as 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant Combined with an expected 15B from Midstream I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at 142B given limited changes in commodity prices and volumesMarathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the  I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period The spread averaged  during most of that period or about 5 greater than the previous quarter All else being equal that equates to a 135B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2 giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of 566BMarathons Depreciation and Amortization has run around 830M and its interest is currently around 142M quarterly Together this creates an extra 972M added quarterly cost Considering this I project Marathons Q3 pretax income at 467B or 37B after taxes 21 historically The company usually has 350M in income attributable to noncontrolling interests giving a final net income estimate of 335B or an EPS of 838 This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at 748For Q4 based on current prices its EBITDA outlook is  lower at 142B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month That equates to an estimated pretax income of 448M or 353 after tax and almost zero after noncontrolling interest 4M or a 001 EPS The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at 453 EPS however those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downsideThese estimates do not account for oneoff costs gains or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathons volumes will also remain constant With hurricane season in full swing refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels Further the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index Ive used The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA however it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to 75 and a Q4 nearer to 1On Monday morning both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 34 indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand As mentioned in my  the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies Potentially the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor See belowEV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1 that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive Further the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower See belowAgain a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread In my previous article regarding Marathon my longterm view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade and today in particular would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil contributing to a permanently higher crack spread Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains partially due In the long run I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline leading to higher crack spreads However the shortterm situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to  Further the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasonsGasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut However oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release Of course no more reserves will come out of the SPR which has lost around half its previous storage levels See belowWe must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues Currently it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate and most lack the information relevant to make that determination Still if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur This potential  exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves both strategic and commercial could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel considering it is  Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time Still gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices mainly if it is already falling with the economy todayThe US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC production cuts offsetting the recovery in US oil production That said the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last See belowAs the rig count declines future oil supplies should trend lower That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline Further a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies potentially harming Marathons steadier income streamAt this point it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count Further should global oil supplies decline enough the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market That said I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon I believe oils bullish case has become much stronger while gasoline is not nearly as solid pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spreadAt todays commodity prices I believe Marathons EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels In the long run I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil However in the short term I believe MPC has ample 12month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinerymargin profit decline shockLooking forward I expect MPCs Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer However from Q4 I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread In my view depending on how the oil markets situation changes an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies For this reason I am bearish on MPC on a 12month outlook basis Its EPS may be around 1 to 2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward PE of 30XI rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable I still like the stock from a longterm perspective but not at its current price given the immediate profit decline To me the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war  global recession causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer If MPC operates in a highly sensitive  environment today it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world Thus if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years as Ive expected its longterm potential would also be minimal   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is

236,Halliburton's Rise: Riding The OPEC Wave,When I penned  on Halliburton  the stock was navigating a challenging phase primarily attributed to declining commodity prices My core investment premise hinged on the belief that production cuts would carve out a more favorable environmentThe move is largely due to the favorable production cuts by OPEC to support oil prices in the face of a potential fall in consumption due to a global slowdownThe global energy narrative took a compelling twist as Saudi Arabia and Russia confirmed their decision to extend  cuts removing a consequentialThe cuts saw Brent crude prices surge past the 90abarrel thresholda point unseen since November 2022There is a strong argument that these factors along with a possible conflict in the Middle East will continue to drive prices higher which will support the multiyear bull thesis I laid out in the last article Heres what I expectAlong with the supportive macro environment for oil prices there are other key business driversWe saw these drivers play out in the last earnings report demonstrating that the firm has been collecting its fair share of winsHalliburtons financial snapshot for 2023s second quarter is a testament to their resilience and adeptnessThis was a strong report and one can argue that the stock deserves to be up more despite the strong move due to supply and demand dynamics supporting a favorable outlookHalliburton will report Q3 earnings on Tuesday October 24 Investors should look for strong EPS figures greater than 075Share but the highlight will be how the changing supply and demand dynamics from OPEC are affecting the business I would expect a strong yearoveryear performance across the board with less sensational improvements quarter over quarterAs you might guess analysts agree that EPS figures will continue to trend upwards and Halliburton has managed to beat expectations in each of the past five quartersIt is likely that we will see the expected growth materialize as the major economies are essentially fully opened and we are unlikely to see any relief from OPEC in the medium turn There is a risk that if a conflict should deepen between Iran and the US following the horrific attacks in Israel Iran could aggressively ramp up production as it has in the past to raise funds This would soften oil prices slightly but a collapse would be unlikely without support from OPEC It is likely that Energy will become a hot theme over the coming months due to these tensions and firms like Halliburton could see some uncharacteristic volatilityHalliburton has undoubtedly proven its mettle amidst fluctuating commodity prices with the stock showcasing an admirable 45 surge in just a year This upward trend fortified by OPECs strategic production cuts and geopolitical intricacies hints at the resilience and adaptability of the company The Q2 earnings report further buttresses Halliburtons prowess in the oilfield landscape However investors should stay alert As global tensions simmer particularly concerning Iran and the US the energy sector might be in for a rollercoaster ride While Halliburton seems wellpoised to benefit from a surge in oil prices a recession could dent consumption and introduce headwinds There is also the tendency of lowcost producers to ramp up production when prices are high That said the trade is a lot clearer than it was a year ago though there is less meat left on the bone I rate Halliburton as a hold   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,1,2023-10-20,0
237,"Big Dividend Yields Going Higher, Dumb Debt, And Snark"," RatesWell congratulations anyway You get the same reward as everyone else more national debtThe market seems settled on raising rates10year Treasury rates  are sitting more than 60 basis points above the trailing 100day average Great Jacking up interest rates is supposed to kill off the companies that were not productive right That makes it a good thingRates can be an issue for mortgage REITs mREITs and equity REITs For equity REITs debt is eventually rolled over at higher rates and investors have more alternatives When interest rates are high because of inflation investors dont get an alternative CPI smoothing through the housing index suppressed the actual rate of inflation Consumer prices were actually rising at doubledigit rates for a while But you probably know that because youve gone places and seen prices A useful techniqueWhen actual prices were growing faster than 10 and Treasury rates were under 15 investors didnt have a choice Equity is a garbage hedge against inflation in the short term but a great hedge in the long term Real estate such as that owned by equity REITs can also serve as a good hedge over long periodsThose low rates pushed investors into equity markets Today Chairman Jerome Powell is ensuring they can get paid on Treasuries We can use TIPS Treasury InflationProtected Securities to measure how much of the yield is coming from inflation expectations If the TIPS yield is high it means investors are being offered an unusually high real inflationadjusted return in the bond marketWhen was the last time the 5year TIPS yield broke this level See the chartCool it was 2006 to 2007 We all remember nothing bad happened then so thats greatThe Federal Reserve successfully convinced investors that they will keep elevated rates even if inflation subsides Whether we get a recession or not the Federal Reserve really wants to see interest expenses explode higherThe market already concluded that inflation would probably be back to about 2This can be a particularly hard environment for most investors When interest rates increase by 50 basis points in a year its no big deal When they rip higher like this it slams into valuationsHigher interest rates delay demand That reduces inflation in the short term which is what everyone focuses on However bigger  create inflation The recent inflation was not caused by monetary policy which means interest rates They were low for over a decade without causing inflation Fiscal policy changed as we shifted from big deficits to multitrillion dollar deficits Some investors still believe that this is some kind of multidecadelagged impact of lower rates Ill never reach those investors Most of you can probably see that inflation picked up promptly after pushing trillions of dollars into the economyDont get me wrong Interest rates have a lagged impact But it isnt a multidecade lag Inflation didnt run under 2 for about 12 years only to rip higher suddenly from the same low ratesThe issue now is that apartment construction is plungingWhy does this matter so muchLets be real Most of Gen Z isnt going to be buying homes Oops did I hurt some feelings Sometimes reality hurtsWhat I want you to see is the navy line and grey lines Thats a huge drop Bad Starts are projected to fall from over 500000 to 250000Do you know what impacts apartment rentsIts supply and demand That was a really obvious answerSo how can a country get more affordable rental units There are two stepsIts like rent control except it works Developers clearly responded to rates as it drove a surge in production and a subsequent plungeWhat do I say to the guy who assumes that building more apartments will just result in millions of new renters showing up to pay the exact same price Nothing Thats dumb Listen to conference calls and investor presentations The big factor that puts pressure on rental rates is local supply levelsThe mortgage REIT book values are going to be down It will be either all or almost all of the mortgage REITs listed here On the other hand business development company BDC book values will be much closer to flat on average There will probably be one or two outliers but most will be pretty flatThe worst losses are probably going to be in the high singledigit percentages or low doubledigit percentages Buyer beware when using the trailing BV figures which are included below Our strategy for trading in the mortgage REIT and BDC space relies on having frequent updates We update estimates most weekends Most Mondays we go into the market with new information For reference there are still some reports on Wall Street where an analyst has one update for the quarter Whats better 1 update or 12 updates When rates are moving this fast it mattersIve got another bold prediction though Absent a major recession or a plunge in interest rates which would probably require a recession preferred shares that are fixedtofloating will have a tendency to climb toward call value as the floating date approaches There are currently 3 mortgage REIT preferred shares that are floating NLYF NLYG and AGNCNTheir share prices are 2534 2473 and 2559 respectively That puts their floating yields in the range of 99 to 105 Some of the mortgage REIT preferred shares involve more risk However many of them have bigger floating spreads Personally I will gravitate more toward the lowerrisk shares However I am venturing into a few of the higherrisk shares where upcoming floating dates imply dramatic upside If shares rally toward 2500 then the yield to call becomes a more useful metric even if calls dont actually occur Of course this only applies to shares that will have a floating rateInvestors tend to like doubledigit yields Some of these shares hit the floating date and will see dividend rates jump 25 to 50 As the floating date approaches weve seen prices go higherOf course thats only one example Yes there are others No they dont fit in this article I already wrote the sections below and the piece is getting too long If you think Im wrong just look at the stability in the share prices for NLYF and AGNCN over the last 2 years They were the first ones to floatIf you missed the announcement you should know that CIM announced CIMB will float using SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment I plan to provide a bigger update on that publicly The announcement came only a few business days after we encouraged Seeking Alpha readers to consider contacting CIM about the situation Particularly appealing was CIMs confirmation in the filing that this would happen automatically under the law CIMs prospectus for CIMB has nearly identical language to PMTs prospectus for PMTA and PMTBReading the waterfall intelligently results in a waterfall that doesnt function The fixedrate dividend wasnt a viable longterm fallback because the qualification was no such dividend period exists rather than no such rate exists CIM was explicit about their shares falling under the LIBOR Act and automatically switching to SOFR Secured Overnight Financing Rate  the spread adjustment about 26 basis points It was an exceptional rebuke to a less ethical peerI want to repeat that with different wording for anyone who missed it CIM did not say Were choosing to use SOFR They said it would happen automatically under the law The only options they had were to accept SOFR  the spread adjustment or break the law No other option Hey PMT why are you looking so shifty over thereIll probably have a public article on it next week For this week I really wanted toIm excited to keep hunting in the preferred share space Several of these shares already yield over 8 and will jump into doubledigit yields when the floating rate kicks in unless the Federal Reserve slashes ratesWe will close out the rest of the article with the tables and charts we provide for readers to help them track the sector for both common shares and preferred sharesWere including a quick table for the common shares that will be shown in our tablesIf youre looking for a stock and I havent mentioned it yet youll still find it in the charts below The charts contain comparisons based on pricetobook value dividend yields and earnings yield You wont find these tables anywhere elseFor mortgage REITs please look at the charts for AGNC NLY DX ORC ARR CHMI TWO IVR EARN CIM EFC NYMT MFA MITT AAIC PMT RITM BXMT GPMT WMC and RCFor BDCs please look at the charts for MAIN CSWC ARCC TSLX TPVG OCSL GAIN GBDC SLRC OBDC PFLT TCPC FSK PSEC and MFICThis series is the easiest place to find charts providing uptodate comparisons across the sector The chart for our public articles uses the book value per share from the latest earnings release Current estimated book value per share is used in reaching our targets and trading decisions It is available in our service but those estimates are not included in the charts below  Presently a few other REITs also have no consensus estimate Due to the way historical amortized cost and hedging is factored into the earnings metrics it is possible for two mortgage REITs with similar portfolios to post materially different metrics for earnings I would be very cautious about putting much emphasis on the consensus analyst estimate which is used to determine the earnings yield In particular throughout late 2022 the earnings metric became less comparable for many REITsI changed the coloring a bit We needed to adjust to include that the first fixedtofloating shares have transitioned over to floating rates When a share is already floating the stripped yield may be different from the Floating Yield on Price due to changes in interest rates For instance NLYF already has a floating rate However the rate is only reset once per 3 months The stripped yield is calculated using the upcoming projected dividend payment and the Floating Yield on Price is based on where the dividend would be if the rate reset today In my opinion for these shares the Floating Yield on Price is clearly the more important metricNote Shares that are classified as Other are not necessarily the same Within The

238,Will Rising Interest Rate Avalanche Crush The Economy And Markets?,For 14 years after the 2008 global financial crisis global central banks held interest rates close to zero In the US cash interest rates never topped 25 and were near zero the vast majority of the time In EuropeAfter the pandemic and massive government deficits sparked runaway inflation this model was shattered into a million pieces Interest rates continue to surge and Im not sure that Yesterday the  with more possible increases to come today with bond yields continuing their landslide Investors are paying even more At the same time home prices are still up about 40 from prepandemic For some rough math buying a 500000 house with a 3 mortgage costs you 1686 per month in principal and interest Add in the 40 increase in home prices and finance it at 8 and that principal and interest payment is 4109 per month At this rate we might be at 8 mortgages in a matter of weeksShould you still borrow as much as possible to buy a house I think its the biggest financial mistake that you as a young sixfigure earner could make especially since you can put your 20 down payment in a money market fund and earn hundreds of dollars per month in interest 55 And if you dont think so the price of money may keep going up until you do courtesy of massive government deficits and the Feds inflationfighting mandate Ive  over the past 18 monthsSome readers will think my work is a total airball because prices are only down like 1 from the peak Theres still time I dont think the economy is going to handle 8 mortgage rates well at all and were about to find out whos right For now homebuilders have sold millions of homes  When these reset I think a lot of dualincome overleveraged people will be in troubleWill we see 9 mortgages Were not that far off Oldtimers may recall mortgage rates this high or higher but to put them in context you need to compare home pricetoincome ratios as well to get debttoincome numbers  despite a lack of population growth and a rapid pace of construction It doesnt add upConsumers largely refuse to save money and the government is looking to borrow as much as possible as well Its simple supply and demand if everyone wants to borrow and there are few people willing to lend then interest rates go up People on the Internet say the Fed will just print more money to bail everyone out but they really cant legally do it with their inflation mandate History is filled with governments who print money to monetize the debt and wipe out the middle classHowever at least in the US and Western Europe central banks have experience fighting inflation and understand the longterm economic consequences of letting inflation skyrocket In the US the public was sick of the shortsighted economic policies of the late 1960s and 1970s and doubledigit inflation Fed chair Paul Volcker took a stand smashing the inflationary psychology via an engineered recession Germany cracked down even further on inflation having learned from the traumatic ingrained experience of the  Interestingly that generations children and grandchildren are todays business leaders there and their thinking largely influenced the euro and the idea of  in Europe in the 2010sAt this point its highly unlikely that the Fed will turn around and print a bunch of money because doing so might drive inflation back not to 8 but to 20 or more annually History shows that Congress eventually gets the message as they did when bond vigilantes forced both the  and  to cut spendingWhat good economists would tell about the large deficits of Bidenomics is that theres a risk of  the rest of the economy Huge government deficits need to be financed by borrowing and finding buyers financing the debt means that interest rates go up People always say the government spends too much but to run these kinds of deficits during peacetime and economic expansion  This has the obvious effect of diverting economic activity that would happen in the private sector to the government Worse socalled  can stop buying government debt sending interest rates skyrocketingFamed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman recently  on rising interest rates in the US which hes winning in spectacular fashion He thinks the 30year Treasury will go to 55 this implies mortgages would be at about 9 It seems that the lessons of the 1970s have been forgotten with 2000 stimulus checks offered up by both parties as the reward for voting for them in 2020 Were paying for those nowThe US government either needs to cut spending or raise taxes or interest rates might just keep going up This inflation surge shouldnt have happened  the Fed should have ended QE far earlier and raised rates sooner The federal government should have spent about a trillion less in 2021 2022 and 2023 Im speculating here but I think if they had then interest rates would be 35 or so and inflation would be a bit above 2Mortgages get all the attention but cars and trucks are expensive Theyre even more expensive when you cant pay cash and need to finance them Prepandemic car loans were cheap 34 for good credit Now customers often need to pay over 7 On a 50000 car loan thats the difference between paying 898 per month and paying 990 Car loan payments arent as sensitive to interest rates as mortgages but as amortizations get longer the effect is greater Again here  since prepandemic so theres a compounded effect Last I looked salaries are up about 1520 since prepandemic so cars and houses being up 40 each is bad news Will American automakers sell as many cars with higher interest rates Economic theory says no There likely will need to be a transition towards more economical cars be they electric vehicles EVs or hybrids because aging consumers with thin balance sheets dont have any business with 1000 car paymentsI think this explains why the Fed and the White House are puzzled by why consumer confidence is so low despite unemployment being low If I waved a wand and awarded you a 100000 job but you have minimal other assets in 2019 you could buy a house and car Now your options are much more limited first because of pandemic shortages from money printing and now because of skyrocketed interest rates Despite making a little more money on paper than before people are worse off in terms of purchasing power unless they went into the pandemic owning one or more houses and carsIn March we saw several regional banks fail in rapid succession Since then things have been quiet although interest rates have increased and lending standards have steadily tightened If you recall from March what crushed these banks was having far too much leveraged exposure to longduration bonds yielding 1 or whatever when they got flooded with deposits in 2021 Then interest rates rose and rose until some banks went broke While betting on bonds with leverage is historically a good trade if you have some yield to work with it requires a higher level of risk management skill Banks like Silicon Valley Bank  didnt have that skill so they went bustI wonder what else is lurking out there with these regional banks The 10year hit a new postcrisis high today and while companies like Charles Schwab  took  to fix their balance sheets I bet a lot of them just stuck their heads in the sand Im not going to name names of banks I think are in trouble but if you see some of these regional banks in the headlines soon being closed for losses then you should not be surprisedI think its also worth noting that like many parts of the economy certain banks and fintechtype companies thrived in an environment where interest rates only went down If they bet the farm on it theyre going to lose the farm if interest rates keep risingRising rates have a direct impact on the stock market by affecting the leading sectors of the economy that rely on loans housing autos etc Another channel that interest rates work through is increasing bond yields and thus financing costs for companies over time Rising rates also have an indirect effect on the stock market by allowing you to earn interest riskfree in money market fundsWhile many investors think things like housing is the best investment ever and nothing can stop it there should be some level of interest rates that makes them change their minds Maybe its a 5 mortgage rate maybe its 7 8 or even 10 Similarly for stocks there be an interest rate on cash that makes you change your mind about wanting to own them If the government decided that theyd pay 20 riskfree in Treasuries would you really want to be punting your money on the NASDAQ  Recall that in the 1970s and 1980s SP 500   of where they are now due to interest rates being skyhighThe question right now  cash interest rates are at 55 while longterm interest rates are rapidly rising Stock prices dont really make sense either on a macro level or whether you dig into bluechip companies and project their cash flows Do you want to buy stocks for nearrecordhigh valuations or keep some of your money in cash Its not an allornothing decision and the higher interest rates go the more apt you should be to save and the less you should be to borrow American consumers just havent gotten the message yet with savings rates near record lows They will though because the price of money will keep going up until it induces them to saveLastly the yield curve is sending a message Inverted yield curves are associated with a recession warning but once the recession actually starts the yield curve tends to rapidly steepen Often the curve steepens because the Fed is cutting but if its steepening because interest rates are skyrocketing it likely has the same effect This will be a real business cycle not the computer simulationscience experiment that the COVID economy wasHas a recession already started and we dont know it yet Student loans for 40 million borrowers are due on October 1st It will be interesting to see how everything shakes out Volatility seasonally  and were right on schedule but its not like the bottom has fallen out yet Whether the rising interest rate landslide continues is likely key to knowing where markets go next If we see the 10year Treasury push towards 55 and mortgages make a run at 9 then its probably game over for the 2023 minibull market with some combination of a housing crash bank failures and stock investors forced to face the reality of steadily rising financing costs for corporate America Stay safe out there What do you think Share your

239,Fluence Energy: Armed With Disruptive A.I.,Dramatic changes in the levelized cost of solar power are currently forcing a sea change in how our electric grid functions In order to mitigate the problems caused by the widespread adoption of solar we areThe passage of the  dramatically increased our  Instantaneously managing something as dynamic and complicated as our grid has always been beyond human capability so up until fairly recently we wouldnt have considered it Developments in Artificial Intelligence have changed everythingFluence Energy Inc  is one of several companies currently positioning themselves to be able to compete for dominance in this highly disruptive emerging industry With the company already vertically integrated for the production ofFluence Energy provides energy storage equipment and services The company was formed in early 2018 as the result of a joint venture between AES Corporation  and Siemens  The two companies  AESs extensive research

battery manufacturer They are several generations into their development and currently produce a highly modular cube shaped battery When used in their separate applications Fluence gives each of their technologies its own unique brand Their gridscale energy storage product is known as Gridstack their control and operation system is known as Ultrastack their solar capture optimization system is known as Sunstack and their commercial energy storage and load flattening system is known as EdgestackThe gridscale battery market is projected to experience a  until 2031 The global smart grid market is projected to have a  until 2030 The United States renewable energy market is estimated to have a  through 2028 and the global market is projected to have a  until 2030The  is one of the primary factors at play when examining longterm energy infrastructure trends With photovoltaics achieving the title of  several years ago additional inclusion of renewable sources seems inevitable However the adoption of intermittent sources has been warping the daily supply and demand curve for grid supplied electricity This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve Uncontrolled overproduction from solar has the potential to damage portions of the grid This problem has grown severe enough that we are already disconnecting portions of commercial scale solar operations during the middle of the daySince the initial adoption of our electric grid it has operated on a continuous supply basis Traditionally because of the significant startup time for most power plants changes in future demand must be forecast Because of the need to avoid shortages not only must demand be forecast managers must intentionally overshoot that expected demand Our continuously oversupplied grid operates with significant waste and is in dire need of storage capacityBecause they are viewed as the single most vital part of our current grid the base load providers have enjoyed superior pricing power at the negotiating table With our inverter technology already above the threshold where they can achieve a strong stable signal and the rise of storage providers undermining the need for continuous oversupply as even more decentralized sources are incorporated into the system the individual negotiating power of electricity producers diminishAs the total storage capacity within the system grows and we incorporate more medium and longterm storage into the system I expect that negotiating power will shift toward the storage providers Eventually they may be able to adopt a  stance while negotiating against any single source provider For this reason I believe only the most costeffective base load providers will thrive in the coming decadesAlso I believe the need for peaker plants  Peaker plants are usually powered by natural gas They are designed to be able to synchronize with the grid and achieve operational power from a cold start within a few minutes We ask them to come online breifly to mitigate the spikes in demand that occur every evening We also ask them to help us maintain stable oversupply during events which cause changes to usage habits on a truly massive scale like the Super Bowl the Olympics or the World CupAs the grid storage industry is incredibly disruptive I also expect a price war to break out Storage providers can collect free or almostfree electricity during periods of overproduction In places where a significant portion of electricity comes from solar this happens in the middle of the day every day They can later sell that electricity when its trading at its highest every evening In addition to experiencing an erosion of their negotiating power I do not expect the source providers will be able to compete with actively managed storage providers if a price war breaks outThe thing to note here is that storage providers are financially incentivized to get their hands on as much overproduction as possible Companies wanting to increase the volume of electricity they can arbitrage each day are going to attempt to install grid scale storage sites into as many markets as possible This is one of the greatest shakeups the industry has seen since its inception we may even see already established utility companies begin installing storage into the service areas of rival utility providers Over the next several decades I believe the arbitrage business has the potential to scale into a truly massive industryThe machine learning software packages that we have been developing to actively manage multiple dynamic sources are what is making this possible I think the companies which are able to develop the most capable AI are the ones which stand to benefit the most from actively managing our future smart gridFluence Energy was formed as an attempt by AES and Siemens to pool their knowledge and experience to produce a company capable of meeting the growing demand for grid scale storage Fluence Energy expanded

contracts had reached 28B as of March 31st coming in approximately 100M above the previous quarter While their parent companies have accounted for a significant portion of their business so far approximately 81 of their backlog is with notrelated parties Their total backlog of contracts is up to 112BThey also increased the amount of assets they had under AI management by 800 MW and were able to place an additional 27 GW under contract for digital management They stated this represented a 200 increase from the previous quarterThey previously expected to be adjusted EBITDA positive in fiscal year 2024 They are now revising their expectations to be close to adjusted EBITDA break even in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 They stated they believe they will not need to raise any additional capital and have ample liquidity to meet their cash needs for the next 12 monthsFluence has been experiencing significant revenue increases Eight quarters ago Fluence Energy had a quarterly revenue of 981M Four quarters ago that had risen to 3427M by this most recent quarter that had further grown to 6982M This represents a total twoyear rise of 6117 at an average quarterly rate of 7647Their margins have been improving for the last several quarters As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 438 EBITDA margins were 488 operating margins were 527 and net margins were 357As of the most recent quarter cash and equivalents was 194M shortterm investments was 70M and quarterly operating income was 37M Their share count has been growing at a fairly stable rate for the last four quarters In June of 2021 total common shares outstanding was at 1143M by this most recent quarter that had risen to 1169M a 227 increaseAs with many spinoffs and joint ventures and unlike many startups Fluence has not had to take on large amounts of debt on its path to operational viability This most recent quarter Fluence Energy had 01M in net interest expense total debt was at 34M and longterm debt was at 0MAs the company approaches adjusted EBITDA profitability I expect that these cash flow values will improve As of this most recent earnings report unlevered free cash flow was at 1234M while levered free cash flow was at 1239MTheir total equity rose dramatically in late 2021 but has been slowly declining since thenSimilar to my thoughts about their cash flow I expect their returns will shift into positive territory as they continue to improve their margins As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was 436 ROCE was 189 and ROE was at 438As of August 3rd 2023 Fluence Energy had a market capitalization of 492B and traded for 2836 per share The company is not profitable so I cannot produce a PEGY estimate but they do have an  of 35 Considering their guidance for profitability I view their forward EVSales of 16x PriceSales of 165x and PriceBook of 1239x as showing the company as presently undervaluedDespite their positive guidance the margin expansion and cash flow improvements might not materialize With their cash and shortterm investments the company currently has 2644M in unrestricted funds Their most recent quarterly levered cash flow was 1239M while cash from operations was 745M EBITDA was at 341M and operating income was 368MI believe that arbitragers will eventually gain significant control over the price of electricity as supply and demand both vary throughout the day However this may not occur If the general public views what the storage providers do as price manipulation they may one day face regulationsFluence Energy has multiple direct competitors including Stem  and Tesla  who are also developing thier own energy production and grid management digital intelligence They also face indirect competition from companies such as C3ai  which are developing digital intelligence services more focused on dynamic consumption management While Fluence certainly does appear to be capable their eventual dominance in this emerging industry is far from a guaranteeThe company currently has 112B under contract waiting to be converted into revenue This most recent quarter they were only able to fill 700M worth of orders and yet signed 28B in new contracts This 28B came in above their previous quarters new contract value of 27B The picture that is being painted by this trend is that demand for their product is currently outstripping the pace they can install new storage Its fairly clear why the company believes they will be able to grow revenue their waiting list is growingThe grid scale storage industry currently uses mostly lithiumion based batteries but I believe this will change As the upcoming production ramp up of  comes to market the total cost of grid scale storage  This should further increase demand for Fluences products and servicesCurrently most of the conversation within the industry is about shortterm storage As we further develop batteries more capable of handling medium and longterm applications the storage market will find new demandFluence Energy is still transitioning from the introductionstartup phase of the business life cycle into the growth phase They are currently blessed with no longterm debt and the low cost of solar should provide them with sustained tailwinds for years to come I think their machine learning digital management packages have already proven themselves effective and are probably one of the reasons the company is experiencing increasing demand This company already has 112B in revenue waiting on them and they are signing up more every quarter Their margins have been improving and guidance is positive so most of my remaining questions revolve around how quickly they can reach positive cash flowBecause of the disruptive nature of their technology and their attractive longterm projected growth rate I believe waiting to buy until after the company achieves positive cash flow may be a mistake   Past performance is no guarantee of future results

240,PPLT: Dead Money Can Come Back To Life,"In a September 3 2023  I concludedOn September 1 nearby NYMEX platinum futures were trading at 96870 per ounce In late October the price was just over 900 per ounce as the rare metal continues to be dead money and a weak link compared to gold Platinum has tested investor patience and perseverance for years and it continues to be a financial thorn in portfolios in late 2023Platinum reached aAs the twentyyear chart illustrates platinum fell from the 2008 record 230880 high to a low under 600 per ounce in March 2020 The 2020 bottom was a spike low during the beginning of the pandemic that caused a tidal wave of selling in markets across all asset classes For over three years 800 has contained selloffs on the downside with the price remaining below the 1300 level While 1050 is the average level platinum futures have spent most of the time below the 1000 per ounce levelThe May 2023 2072 high on the nearby COMEX gold futures contract was a double top formation as the futures reached precisely that level in March 2022 The failure to reach a higher high led to a correction that took the continuous gold futures contract below 1810 per ounce in early October 2023Gold fell reaching a low on October 6 The October 7 terrorist attack in Israel caused gold futures to turn higher rallying to nearly 2000 in late October and probing above that level on the nearby December futures contractA close above 1950 per ounce on October 31 will establish a bullish key reversal on the monthly gold futures chart which could lead to new record highs above the 2072 technical resistance level Gold is the leading precious metal While platinums nickname was  for decades because of its rarity compared to gold it has not lived up to that moniker in a decadeThe platinumgold spread measures the relationship between the precious metalsThe chart of continuous NYMEX platinum futures minus the continuous COMEX gold futures shows platinums premium rose to a record high at over 1200 per ounce in 2008 when platinum prices peaked Since then platinum has lost its luster versus gold with the spread making lower highs and lower lows At around a 1075 discount for platinum under gold on October 26 the spread is sitting near a record low and the bearish trend remains intact with platinum underperforming gold for the past decade and a halfIn September 2023 the  reported a 22 larger platinum supply deficit than previously expected for 2023 at a record one million ounces Growing requirements and flat supplies drove the shortfall between supply and demandCatalytic converter jewelry and glassmaking demand has grown 27 to 82 million ounces in 2023 while supply remains at 72 million ounces the same as in 2022 Platinum supplies have not increased because of ongoing electricity shortages in South Africa the worlds leading producerThe WPIC expects automotive and industrial consumption to deplete aboveground stocks in 2024 likely increasing the fundamental deficit next year Meanwhile the price action tells us that investors have ignored the supplydemand deficit with platinum sitting just above 900 per ounce on October 26The chart highlights the bearish pattern of lower highs and lower lows over the past months Since peaking at over 1100 in May platinum futures fell below 860 per ounce The price was not far above the low in late October as a stable US dollar and the rising interest rates have weighed on the price This week the US 30year Treasury bond futures fell to the lowest level since 2007 Higher rates increase the cost of carrying commodity inventories The dollar is the international pricing benchmark for most commodities and platinum is no exception A higher dollar increases the cost of platinum in other currencies weighing on the demandMeanwhile investors have shunned platinum despite the fundamental deficit Trendfollowing traders have no reason to purchase the metal given its bearish trend and underperformance compared to gold for yearsThe total annual platinum production of 72 million ounces equates to 224 metric tonsAs the chart shows South Africa produced 625 of the worlds platinum in 2022 with Russian output accounting for 9The bifurcation of the worlds nuclear powers the wars in Ukraine and Israel and tensions between the USEurope and ChinaRussia may only exacerbate platinums supply shortage in 2024 While China is the leading platinumconsuming country Europe and the US are second and third Since over 70 of the worlds annual platinum supplies come from BRICS countries the tensions could lead to supply disruptions or even trade embargos BRICS countries are moving towards a BRICS currency challenging the US dollar for crossborder trade Sanctions on Russia and trade restrictions on China have caused them to seek alternatives to the US currency Since China is the worlds secondleading economy a BRICS foreign exchange instrument could diminish the US dollars reserve currency role When it comes to platinum the tight fundamentals and production from BRICS countries may only exacerbate supply concerns leading to higher pricesMoreover platinum is a thinly traded precious metal On October 25 COMEX golds open interest was 467547 contracts representing 46754700 ounces worth over 93 billion at 1990 per ounce NYMEX platinums open interest at 81905 contracts reflects 4095250 ounces worth 372 billion at 908 per ounce The 2022 annual gold mine supply of 3100 metric tons was 138 times higher than platinum productionThe bottom line is that platinum is a thinly traded futures market which could lead to significant volatility if the price turns higher Low liquidity creates an environment where prices can rise or fall to illogical irrational and unreasonable levels that defy fundamentals While platinum has been under pressure for years the potential for a sudden and violent upside move remains a clear and present danger given the supplydemand equation BRICS production dominance and golds price appreciationIf platinum will resume its previous position as  the current price is a bargain Riskreward favors the upside making platinum highly attractive in the current environmentThe most direct route for platinum investment is via the physical market for bars and coins However physical platinum investment involves significant premiums to the spot or futures price because of the limited suppliesNYMEX futures are another investment avenue as they converge with spot prices during delivery periods as the exchange offers a physical delivery mechanism Each NYMEX contract contains 50 troy ounces of platinumThe fund summary for the   statesAt 8314 per share on October 26 PPLT had around 870 million in assets under management PPLT trades an average of 68729 shares daily and charges a 060 management feeI continue to be a very frustrated platinum bull However I will add to long positions on further price weakness as the fundamental deficit and BRICS production dominance is a potentially bullish cocktail for the metal long overdue for an explosive rally Leave room to add as picking bottoms in any market is dangerous Platinum is cheap compared to gold and its low liquidity could make a rally over the coming months and years explosiveThe  is one of the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from a

money for your best investment ideas Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium It is not news that US natural gas prices  are highly volatile In addition to the usual cycles from overproduction to shortages in commodity markets we are dealing with a commodity where the balance of supply and demand is so delicate that it can change dramatically even in response to single hardtopredict technical factors such as the Freeport explosion last year And of course natural gas price is highly weatherdependent which apparently gives it an undeniable reputation as a widow makerThe analysis of natural gas supply andIn this article by contrast we will take a holistic approach and try to analyze the dependence of the price of natural gas on just one variablehow much gas is in storage We will see how this dependence has changed in the past and try to look into the futureBelow you can see graphs of natural gas prices and storage surplus compared to the average of the previous five years The first thing I noticed when I put these graphs together was that the words of natural gas producers representatives that the current surplus will dissipate sounded even more convincing to me This is not just an abstractly rational statement from the point of view of market laws natural gas inventories have indeed always tended towards their average value at least in recent years At the same time compared to production volumes the deficit and surplus have never looked too largeThe maximum surplus we see on the graph is produced in about a week and the exports that have fallen due to an accident at just one LNG terminal in a few months exceed the current surplus The market is constantly doing the delicate work of balancing itselfAs you might expect if one compares graphs of natural gas price and surplus it is easy to see that they are related Price minima were reached in 2016 2020 and 2023 almost simultaneously with the maximum surpluses This years price minimum was higher than in the previous two cases but the surplus was also slightly lower this year so this years price minimum fits nicely into the series of previous price minimumsAt the same time we see that the moderate supply deficit in 2022 coincides with much higher prices compared to previous years To make sense of this lets take a look at the graph below where prices are shown as a function of the natural gas storage surplus While what we see is far from a perfectly smooth line the graph clearly shows that in recent years prices have depended on the surplus in one of two patterns shown in different colorsUntil 2021 we have a flatter curve with a somewhat stronger rise in prices to 4 at the very left side of the graph when the deficit is at its maximum Between 2021 and 2022 we have an impressive price increase to almost 10 even with moderate deficits The difference between the two patterns is clearly visible just when there is a deficit of natural gas in storage while when there is a surplus prices are in the same range Perhaps the reason is that when there is a surplus the market pays more attention to the production cost below which the natural gas output will be drastically reduced which will quickly bring the surplus to zero The production cost apparently has not changed radically in recent years in the sense that it has changed less than the statistical spread of the values on the graph Anyway the market is now in surplus and we cant tell from this graph whether the later paradigm is continuing or whether we are back to the earlier preLNG paradigm There is another way to find it out we will come back to that laterIt is important to note that although the temporal boundary between the two patterns is arbitrary to some level in order to clearly separate the points the border had to be drawn in 2021 In other words well before the beginning of problems with Russian gas supplies to Europe due to the war and thus the paradigm shift that led to the emergence of the later pattern can hardly be explained solely by panic It seems that between mid2019 when the period of natural gas deficit in the market ended and early 2021 when the deficit returned to the market something happened that changed the response of natural gas prices to its deficit in a big way namely it led to much higher prices What exactly happened I think the correct answer is that during this time period the amount of LNG exported from the US doubled increasing by over 5 bcfd As you can see in the graph below this was the period of the fastest growth in LNG exports in history and I have not found any other events of such magnitude in the natural gas market to put forward an alternative hypothesisAlso from 2021 onwards there has been a period of high prices in global LNG markets and there is a great temptation to attribute the high US natural gas prices to the impact of external prices due to the globalization of the natural gas market In practice it is not that simple A very common and reasonable counterargument is that if LNG terminals are operating at full capacity for the US natural gas market it doesnt matter how much natural gas costs in Europe or Asia it wont be possible to increase exports But first of all although Im not an expert Ill allow myself to speculate on the following topic From my observations of export volumes I can assume that LNG terminals have some freedom in how much gas to deliver at a given moment a bit more or a bit less The monthly export high as seen in the graph above was reached in April of this year at 126 bcfd This is quite significantly higher than in many of the recent months when Freeport was either already operating or still operating ie nominal liquefaction capacity was the same as it is now And all this time it was thought that export capacity was fully utilized The market may believe that higher prices on global markets can lead to a 1 bcfd increase in supply a value that seems reasonable based on the chart below which is not a negligible amount Such an increase in exports alone would bring the entire current surplus to zero in about 7 months Second whether or not the global markets impact on the US is justified it is definitely there and has been for a number of years Will it suddenly come to an end given the fact that in the coming years we will see an increase in LNG exports and as a consequence a move towards the already undeniable globalization of the natural gas market I doubt itImportantly the futures market also seems to believe that prices will continue to follow the trajectory from the later pattern and thus we continue to be in it As shown in the graph below starting in 2025 the futures market predicts average annual prices just above 4 It makes sense that the futures market assumes that there will be a zero deficit on average for each of these years because the market is effectively seeking balanceIf so then futures prices are consistent with the later pattern The pricevssurplus graph shows that natural gas prices near zero surplus are clustered around 4 for the second pattern while the corresponding prices for the first are around 3The main conclusion of this article is that during the next period of natural gas deficit prices are likely to rise much more than the market currently expects How far we are from that period depends on many factors those are described in the introduction The main one is the weather In addition such a forecast itself implies an increase in price volatility not a decrease Therefore buying decaying financial instruments like  and  does not seem like a good idea to me despite my bullish position on natural gasI think it is better to buy shares of natural gas producers However the attention should be paid to their financial strength and their low production costs which can ensure that the company will safely survive the period of low prices if it lasts for some time I also think it is important to pay attention to how a company hedges natural gas prices The less hedges the more upside in my opinion For this reason if I could only own shares of one natural gas producer I would choose Antero Resources  But that is a pretty risky approach Do your own due diligence   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is

242,Livent: Lithium Boom Or Bust? Analysts Are Rightfully Bullish,The  one of Americas largest lithium producers is currently down 20 yeartodate It has lost close to 60 of its value since its peak above 35 last yearIn this article well take a lookWell also discuss the riskreward as analysts continue to believe that LTHM is poised to doubleGiven its financial numbers and longerterm opportunities I absolutely agree with thatSo lets dive inThe Livent Corporation originally known as FMC Lithium USA Holding Corp was established in 2018 as an independent companyThe company whose roots go back to 1944 is headquartered in Philadelphia Pennsylvania and specializes in the production of various lithium compounds with a focus on highperformance lithium productsThese compounds are essential in applications such as electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy technologiesAs we can see in the overview below Livents core products include batterygrade lithium hydroxide lithium carbonate butyllithium and highpurity lithium metalAdditionally Livent offers specialty lithium compounds such as lithium phosphate pharmaceuticalgrade lithium carbonate highpurity lithium chloride and specialty organicsIn order to grow its business in an industry critical to supplying muchneeded materials for the energy transition the company has a growth strategy built on four pillars two of which stand out to meAs the overview above shows Livent has its first customer agreement with Ford for the delivery of up to 13000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year over an 11year periodThe company also announced a proposal to merge with Allkem creating a leading global lithium chemicals producerThe merger offers increased scale vertical integration and growth opportunitiesAs of 2Q23 key milestones have been achieved including regulatory notifications and applications and a preliminary S4 registration statement filed with the SECLivent and Allkem shareholders are expected to vote on the merger in the fourth quarter of 2023Almost needless to say Livent anticipates significant growth in the electric vehicle market driven by increased consumer awareness government incentives and the need for carbon reductionHaving said that its not an undisrupted uptrend for minersThe Wall Street Journal said it best when it wrote an  with the title on October 17The article mentioned that one of Livents peers Albemarle  recently walked away from a 42 billion deal to acquire Australian lithium miner Liontown ResourcesThis decision was influenced by several factors including a declining lithium price financial concerns and strategic considerations The lithium price has plummeted from 66000 per metric ton in 2022 to around 27000 by October 2023 impacting revenues of the entire industryOne big factor is weakening Chinese demandChinas lithium market is adversely affected by weak consumer and business confidence as well as an ongoing property crisisEV sales growth in China decelerated to 37 in the second quarter in contrast to the global average of 50Consequently Chinese lithium carbonate futures have plummeted by approximately 37 since their introduction in July leading to a substantial 35 discount compared to lithium hydroxide futures in the United StatesAfter all Chinese demand accounts for 40 of lithium demandAlthough Western lithium prices are also under pressure they receive some support from battery metal buyers in countries like South Korea and Japan who aim to benefit from tax incentives tied to President Joe Bidens climate billNevertheless the decline in lithium prices may persist  to Citigroup lithium carbonate and hydroxide prices could drop another 15 to 20 in the near term due to weak demand high inventories and improved supplyDuring its 2Q23 earnings call Livent commented on these developments highlighting that lithium prices have stabilized at more sustainable levels after reaching historic highs at the end of 2022The floor price is estimated to be above 30 per kilo in China with the expectation that it will continue at this level through 2024While there may be price spikes due to supply and demand factors underlying market fundamentals remain tightAs a result the company reaffirmed its fullyear 2023 guidance projecting revenue in the range of 1025 to 1125 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of 530 to 600 millionThis guidance implies significant revenue and EBITDA growth compared to 2022 driven by higher volumes and average realized prices despite anticipated higher costsOn a longerterm basis the company should continue to benefit from a widening supply gap especially if rising cyclical demand meets a strong secular bull caseIt also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet Analysts expect the company to lower net debt to 9 million this year followed by a decline to 54 million in net cash at the end of 2024 This means that the company is expected to end up with more cash than gross debtAs I mentioned in the introduction LTHMs stock price has come down crashing However analysts still believe that the fair value is in the lower30s rangeWhile I wouldnt be surprised if these targets were to come down a bit if the company hints at potentially prolonged weakness in the industry when it reports its earnings on October 31 were dealing with a very attractive riskrewardLooking at the chart below we see that the company has had a normalized PE ratio of 46x since it became an independently traded companyWe also see that the company is expected to grow its earnings per share by 14 next year followed by 3 growth in 2025 Needless to say these numbers can be much higher if lithium prices rebound They also can come in lowerCurrently Livent is trading at less than 9x earnings Even a return to a 28x multiple in 2025 incorporating the aforementioned expected growth rates could result in an annualized return of 77A higher valuation and higher expected growth could significantly improve that potential returnWhile I absolutely believe that the stocks fair value is more than 100 above its current stock price were dealing with a very tricky situationFurther cyclical weakness could easily cause this stock to drop another 10 to 20So whenever were dealing with highreturn highrisk investments I make the case that the best way to deal with this valuation is to buy gradually and keep positions smallIf you believe that lithium is right for you I would start very small and gradually add to the positionIn a scenario where LTHM keeps dropping investors can average down If LTHM rallies investors have a foot in the doorI believe this is the best way to deal with a very favorable longterm investment opportunity that faces shorterterm cyclical risksIn light of the riskreward I give LTHM a ratingBut then again if you mainly invest in lowvolatility dividend growth stocks or similar While Livent has faced a turbulent year with a significant drop in stock price theres an intriguing upside for investors who can navigate the cyclical risksWith a focus on lithium a crucial component in EV batteries and renewable energy tech Livents growth strategy capacity expansion and commitment to nextgen compounds show promiseDespite the recent decline in lithium prices Livent maintains a stable financial position and anticipates longterm growth opportunitiesThe stock is trading at an attractive valuation offering a potentially high return but it comes with a risk considering industry uncertaintiesJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs Preferreds

243,Cenovus Energy: Cash Drain Ending,  made a few acquisitions that resulted in a bunch of onetime expenditures  also began operations whileCenovus Energy has a cash flow advantage over many competitors because the thermal business often requires a relatively large cash investment first before production begins Therefore there is a depreciation component that protects cash flowCenovus management appears to have determined that some cash flow will be used to grow the company business That decision is part of the free cash flow calculation used to determine the cash available to return to shareholders Investors need to remember that Free Cash Flow is not GAAP or any other accounting standard Therefore the calculation of Free Cash Flow can and in fact does vary among companies This should be expected when there is no formal standard That means Free Cash Flow is often not comparable until the numbers are reviewed and adjusted for an apples to apples comparisonObviously the debt progress came to a grinding halt when the acquisitions were made But management remains focused enough to resume progress as shown aboveRising prices of commodities should help that forward progress But so will the transition of cashusing assets to cash generating assetsLonger term the acquired refining assets need to be optimized to maximize the profits of the combined company That means that the refining and upgrading process will need to handle more thermal oil production in the future while turning that oil into profit maximizing products Given that the market price relationships can change due to supply and demand imbalances this demands a flexible manufacturing processThe  be thought of as a starting point The same can be said for current utilization rates and other key production figures that help to determine overall profitabilityThe main goal is to avoid periods of thermal oil pricing weakness that decimated results in the past before there was more refining capacity Some products like asphalt could well reflect thermal oil pricing weakness even though they are value added because the primary source of asphalt is a discounted productOthers like gasoline can also be made from light oil and therefore are likely to have a sales price that holds up better during times of weak commodity prices during a cyclical business downturn cycleThis process will likely take years rather than happen overnight That implies a gradually widening corporate margin when compared to the past under similar conditions Given that commodity prices fluctuate all the time this is the kind of progress that shareholders find hard to see happeningThe other thing is that the acquisition of more refining capacity over the last few years means that there is a switch in suppliers to the Cenovus thermal production This can be traumatic for the refining business as well because thermal supplies can vary Sometimes the variation is so great that capital expenditures to the refinery are required Therefore using Cenovus products at the acquired facilities may take some time in addition to taking the time needed to maximize profits using this supply sourceLong term there is still a very clear need for more refining capacityAs can be seen above there is still a fair amount of production that is exposed to commodity prices because there is no downstream capability for that excess production Clearly management can make money on that production selling it at commodity pricing or they would not produce it in the first placeBut longterm enhanced profitability will likely happen through the expansion of downstream capabilities Management has noted some debottlenecking opportunities But left unsaid is that management is probably opportunistically shopping for a refinery or two that can fit the corporate organizationWhile the company has made considerable progress there is clearly still a lot of potential upside in the optimizing profits processIn addition to the previous discussion management plans to grow upstream production While that makes downstream production expansion capabilities a priority as well it does mean that this management has a full plate of future growth projects on the tableAn integrated company often means that growth in place often implies growth elsewhere to optimize profitsWhat this appears to point towards is high singledigit growth rates for the company well into the future Now that the company is far larger than it was when I first initiated coverage the initial frantic growth rate will give way to a growth and income strategy for the foreseeable futureThat means total annual returns from growth will likely decline But the increased safety of an enhanced downstream division will remove some of the corresponding risk to achieve what management likely believes is an acceptable proposition to Mr MarketThere are other possibilities in the offshore and overseas business But probably the most attractive idea is for the unconventional business or conventional depending upon the area to find condensate that can be used by the company to make the oil produced flow through the pipelines If this happens and is successful then it would eliminate a major purchase from outside suppliersManagement has at times mentioned the need for condensate and wants to explore the acquired acreage for more products than the current natural gas production But there is no guarantee of success The speculative upside for shareholders would be company supplied condensate as a major cost reductionCenovus Energy Inc management has done very well as quarterly cash flow is up something like 16 to 32 times depending upon commodity prices for the quarter since I began coverage of this company about 5 years ago Obviously there is still a lot of work to be doneThere is also a potential foray into the Chemicals business that many diversified giants haveThe very low stock price valuation protects against the threat of downside principal loss over the long term It should be noted that Mr Market really has yet to give the company any credit for the larger downstream operation This company is a strong buy consideration because the upside potential from all those acquisitions far exceeds any downside potential at the current priceAs long as Cenovus Energy Inc grows I intend to hold the stock until the story changes materially However the volatile trading price does allow for a lot of trading opportunities along the way So there are likely to be a lot of ways to make money With the currently low market valuation

244,This Is Why You Should Stay Bullish,"One year ago I advised investors in this report not to be bamboozled by conventional thinking Most economists and market strategists were convinced that the rapid rise in shortterm interest rates from the zero bound to what is now more thanThe fault in this line of thinking was failing to recognize that we are not in a typical business cycle The combination of the pandemic unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and the war in Ukraine over the past three years resulted in extremes in supply and demand that required us to step outside the box of conventional thinking Regardless the pessimists have dug their heels soFridays jobs  for August was another step in the direction of a soft landing We saw a continuation of slower job growth 187000 easing wage inflation and an uptick in the supply of labor which increased the participation rate This is music to the Feds ears in its effort to restore price stability without ending the ongoing expansion in the economy The increase in the unemployment rate from 35 to 38 was largely due to new entrants in the workforceThe pessimists are already pointing to this increase as a warning sign that a significant stock market decline and recession are on the horizon but they are again failing to recognize the strength of the foundation to this expansion and bull marketIt makes sense to assume that when interest rates go up rapidly consumers will spend less on goods and services businesses will spend less on equipment and expansion corporate profits will decline sharply and unemployment will rise meaningfully enough to result in an economic contraction The anomaly that helped us avoid this fate one year ago when inflation was more than 9 and interest rates were starting to rise was an unprecedented amount of excess savings held on consumer balance sheets Bearish forecasters failed to appreciate the potency of this phenomena It was the fuel that kept real inflationadjusted consumer spending growing which is why we avoided a recessionNow that excess savings has fallen closer to prepandemic levels those who failed to recognize its significance are asserting that consumer spending will collapse under the weight of the lagged impact of higher interest rates Again a logical conclusion but one that fails to recognize a new development long in the makingEarlier this year I forecast that we would see a return to real wage growth just as excess savings no longer became relevant To that point last weeks jobs report showed average hourly earnings growth of 43 which is in excess of the latest Consumer Price Index figure of 32 That is helping to soften the blow of lower savings levels and softer wage gains but it does not explain economic resilience in the face of higher interest rates Todays resilience is due to the fact consumers and businesses are far less sensitive to rising borrowing costs than they have been in the pastFor all the concern about overleveraged consumer balance sheets household debt as a percentage of US gross domestic product has fallen from more than 100 during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008 to a twodecade low of 77 This is a result of more responsible lending standards and more reasoned consumersIn addition there has also been a dramatic decline in the amount of aftertax income required to service outstanding debt The debt servicing ratio fell from a record high 132 to an alltime low during the pandemic and it remains near a multidecade low of 96The decline in outstanding stock of debt is the reason that the 500 basis points in rate increases by the Fed over the past 18 months only resulted in a 15 increase in the percentage of disposable income required to service that debt This is helping to sustain consumer spending levels and prolong the expansion but it isnt just the consumer who is less sensitive to changes in monetary policyCorporate debt has seen similar  The stock of outstanding corporate debt as a share of GDP at 43 is not far from its 2008 peak of 45 but as a percentage of corporate net worth it is at a 50year low Additionally the debt outstanding is predominately fixed rate and longer term with average maturities ranging from four to 10 years depending on asset class The percentage of investmentgrade debt maturing after 2028 has risen to 56 while the percentage of highyield debt is up to 42 This means that corporate America is also less sensitive to rising interest rates In fact the Feds ratehike campaign has been a windfall for most sectors of the SP 500  because net interest costs as a percentage of posttax profits have collapsedDuring the ultralow interest rate period from 20202022 corporations refinanced outstanding debt at fixed rates for longer terms in the same way that homeowners refinanced mortgages When the yield curve inverted due to the surge in shortterm rates corporations started earning huge sums on their cash balances in the same manner that retail investors are profiting from money market funds This is boosting corporate profits and helping to fuel capital spending as net interest costs have plunged to a 60year lowThose who remain pessimistic will chant higher for longer when it comes to the Feds monetary policy which they assert will end the expansion and send the SP 500 to much lower levels than we see today I could not disagree more for the reasons I have outlined Consumers and corporations are far less sensitive to rising interest rates than they have been in the past With the Feds ratehike cycle having likely concluded and the disinflationary trend intact a soft landing is looking more probable with each passing month Estimates for corporate profits in 2024 are inching upward I expect the SP 500 will achieve new alltime highs in the coming 612 monthsLots of services offer investment ideas but few offer a comprehensive topdown investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your

245,UAW Strike And Saudi Oil Cuts Are The Fed's New Inflation Nightmare,August CPI and retail sales numbers  this week signaling a new phase in the Feds battle to bring down inflation Adding fuel to the inflationary fire United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain has declared a simultaneous strike at theHonor trust and respect are key in some aspects of life Labor negotiations with Corporate America are not one of them All that matters with union negotiations is leverage Enter Shawn Fain bulldog leader for the United Auto Workers union Negotiations over the past year show that labor unions in key bottlenecks of the economy have been able to demand eyepopping deals with companies Airline pilots demanded and  the Teamsters grabbed a deal to push UPS  driver pay in five years and  and  have threatened strikes as well to renegotiate pay packages This ramps up the pressure on the UAW to go big or go home in its own negotiationsSo whats going on here with these huge pay increasesThe fact that major unions are demanding and getting large pay increases speaks to the amount of damage that has already been done to the purchasing power of workers In the 1970s in particular these kinds of wage demands led to inflation by creating whats known as a wageprice spiral Now its interesting to see these coming back in a big way including the UAWs  to price increasesThe UAW chose to begin by striking roughly 13000 workers here with the implicit threat that they can double down a couple of more times without depleting their strike fund Their tactics are sharp here because they can virtually guarantee that theyll cost General Motors  Ford  and Stellantis  billions of dollars in lost profits either way Its quite possible that the UAW could win the battle but lose the war as the Big 3 auto manufacturers are not the most competitive globally and have a poor track record of handling changeKey parts of the American manufacturing economy are not competitive with Mexico China and Eastern Europe As such unemployment should naturally be a good amount higher than it is now To keep this from happening in the post2008 world industry in the US and parts of Western Europe has been propped up by tax cuts subsidies and rockbottom interest rates Now inflation is taking this option away which is likely to lead to a more difficult process of reeducating and retraining workers to be competitive in the 21st century Elon Musks Tesla  is competitive globally but  than the union workers make and the unions are demanding a 40 raiseThe UAW striking here will directly increase inflation because theyre walking off the job when they would be making cars In the short run this means consumers are likely to have fewer choices of cars and will face higher prices This directly complicates the Feds inflation fight which has relied partly on used cars dropping to bring overall consumer prices back towards target Also notable is how poorly stocks have performed after getting crushed by unions in negotiations UPS stock is lagging the market by roughly 30 percentage points this year while American Airlines  is lagging by more than 10 with the flight attendant union looking for a new deal as well My guess with the automakers is that the union will get a surprisingly good deal or will strike long enough to punish the stocks anyway Im less certain that the UAW is prepared for the shift to electric cars many of which will be made overseas or in more employerfriendly jurisdictions like TexasThe Saudis are ramping up the pressure with supply cuts and its working Oil fell from its highs of around 120130 per barrel when the economy slowed last fall and stocks entered a bear market Now supply cuts have WTI oil back into the 90s One way to think about this is that the Biden administration wants oil as low as possible for the 2024 election and that the Saudis want it as high as possible The Saudis won the first round in 2021 and 2022 but the Biden administration won the second with a warm winter in the US and Europe and the Inflation Reduction Act bringing optimism about the supply chain The results of the third round remain to be seen but its going to be very difficult to escape higher oil prices in the short run if Saudi Arabia doesnt play ballThis is a huge challenge for the Fed Though the Fed targets core inflation with its policies the August CPI report showed that transportation services rose 2 for the month the biggest rise of any category outside of energy Transportation services are part of core inflation underscoring the risks of another inflation surge happening under our noses Does the increase in transportation services have anything to do with the Saudis driving oil up and labor unions in the transportation sector dropping the hammer You bet it does Oil has been higher in the past especially when adjusted for inflation The current surge in inflation has occurred without outofcontrol oil prices Imagine how bad prices for all kinds of goods and services would be with oil at 150 This isnt my current base case but history shows that its possible with war or supply cuts If you believe  showing continued growth in oil demand over the next few years this is going to be a structural problem for pricesDue to the base effects from last year and higher energy and transportation costs inflation is increasing and getting further from the Feds 2 annual target Adding a prolonged strike at the automakers is not helping the cause calling into question the markets belief that the Fed is most likely done hiking interest ratesThe Fed has more or less boxed itself in from hiking in September by public comments various Fed speakers have made in recent days For yearend is showing that the Fed has roughly a 60 chance of staying put vs a 40 chance of hiking more The Fed had already said they would hike once more in 2023 so traders will get more information about this from this weeks meeting  the Fed is still behind the curve by trying to do the minimum The 3030 Taylor Rule model runs in my latest calculations are calling for at least one more hike What should the Fed do at this weeks FOMC meeting My guess is that theyll hold interest rates steady but signal a hike in November and a higher level of interest rates and inflation for 2024 in their The European Central Bank the ECB indicated that theyre likely pausing hikes this week and markets reacted mechanically by dumping the euro and panicbuying US stocks However what the ECB is really saying with their actions is that theyre concerned about how deep the coming recession will be and are trying to limit the damage This is likely why the panic buying completely reversed itself on Friday while yields continued to grind higher Over in Japan theyre struggling with inflation as well and recent moves to relax their interest rate controls are  If the BOJ hikes interest rates and abandons yield curve control that cuts off another key source of money thats helped hold interest rates lowThe Fed is in the same quandary as the ECB Union negotiations at home and oil prices shooting up mean that the economic models are probably right and that the Fed cant simply pause and pray Theyll need to hike one or two more times to avoid losing control of prices even into early signs of a moderate to severe recession 30year mortgage rates are creeping towards 8 in the US while car loans are moving towards 7 Its hard for interest rates to go down with stubborn inflation and deficits as big as they are and there doesnt seem to be any appetite to raise taxes or cut spending I dont think the economy is going to handle this very well at allInflation was supposed to be gone by now but recent data shows that  back to the upside With labor trouble at home and the Saudis cutting oil production abroad the Fed likely will have to tighten a bit more to balance supply and demand This comes as leading economic indicators continue to worsen amidst rates for mortgage and auto loans hitting fresh post2008 highs Thats bad news for traders expecting a Fed pivot and a corporate profit boom The stock market remains overvalued Therefore Im still firmly in the camp of holding money in cash paying 55 and waiting for a steep correction or crash in stocks before doing any significant buying While there are always a few good deals in any market the broad market indices look increasingly overvalued What do you think Share your thoughts in the commentsEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that

246,Cautiously Bullish Oil,For the most part indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish  as they have been for much of this yearOn the term structure front both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports reduced production of Saudi heavysour crudes which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline and a number of other factors the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardationMeanwhile WTI calendar spreads represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole The EIAs historically noisy estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen Regardless the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at presentWe can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above as well as looking at refined product crack spreads As we can see below gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firmClearly the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand sideSuch dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline or to reduce runs thus reducing the amount of crude they consume This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market After all refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oilThus all else equal unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the 95100 area in the near future particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lowerThough as we have seen outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic with the DubaiBrent spread a proxy for AsiaChina oil demand continuing to trend lower overall and near parityWhile the various AfricaBrent crude oil differentials also remain strong This is an important relationship to track as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell offWhile the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September Indeed if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages the picture has now turned unfavourable as we are seeing far more builds than drawsIn terms of commercial inventory levels overall total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages as do diesel stocks The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present For me to once again become uber bullish though I remain cautiously bullish persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the normIn terms of the outlook for supply and demand consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4 though to a lesser extent prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024 Although such forecasts are full of assumptions and thus fraught with error it is worth noting what the EIA IEA OPEC and others are expecting in terms of production and consumption For now consensus is expecting a 051 mbd deficit to close out the year which if true will show up in persistent inventory drawdowns as well as the key indicators of the physical market which to me are far more reliable indicators of the outlook for oil When it comes to positioning this is unfortunately where things take a bearish turnAll good bull markets in energy are driven by low levels of speculative positioning ie hedge funds and CTAs who are then forced to cover shorts and drive prices higher on the back of favourable fundamentals This is exactly what has occurred since speculators were caught heavily underweight crude oil around midyear thus providing the fuel for much of the subsequent rally from 70 to 95 crudeNow despite a significant level of unwinding of speculative longs in RBOB gasoline and ultras low sulfur diesel ULSD futures hedge funds and CTAs remain heavily long WTI futures a dynamic which will prove a material headwind for oil This is not to say speculative positioning cannot become even more extended but the fundamentals need to be significantly bullish for them to do soFrom a technical perspective however it is difficult to argue that recent price action remains favourable for bulls We continue to see a trend of higher highs and higher lows with the 9092 level now acting as key resistance Should we fail once again to break through this level then I suspect this is the market telling us how high the ceiling is for oil prices for the time being But as it stands price action remains constructive and a break above 92 for WTI should usher in 100 crude in short orderThe same can be said of the energy equities with the XLE ETF  continuing its relative strength and very much looking like it wants to break out above the 93 level which has acted as key resistance for over 12 months now Again a decisive break to the upside would be telling in relation to the future movements in the energy spaceOn the other hand it is also worth noting we are now entering the worst seasonal period for oil prices in the final few months of the year The Northern Hemispheres summer driving season is behind us although it must be said seasonal swings in demand have had very little impact on price movements this year as supply shortages have been the primary market driver The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,4,2023-10-23,0
247,"XLE: Crude Oil Goes Boom - Protect Yourself, Buy Energy",On April 20 I wrote an  titled  In that article I made the case to buy energy stocks to be protected from what could become aHeres a part of my takeawaySince then the Energy ETF  has rallied roughly 11 beating the SP 500 by 300 basis pointsNow its time for an update Not only have I written countless articles on various energy stocks updating my bull case but weve also seen a confirmation of my thesisAfter breaking out in July crude oil futures are back at 90 Thats despite poor consumer confidence and a general downtrend in economic growthIn this article Ill discuss the drivers of this bull case and explain why I continue to believe that owning energy stocks is so importantSo lets get to itLike every other commodity oil is all about supply and demandThe supply picture is what worries me meaning it could cause high inflation for many years to come because major basins in the US are running out of steamAfter the Great Financial Crisis US shale production was the reason why global oil prices were subdued most of the time especially after 2014 In 2007 the US produced roughly 500 thousand barrels of oil per day using unconventional measures horizontal drilling Now that number is 8 million barrels per day higherThis annoyed OPEC a lot It even annoyed US producers as they were producing so much that every decline in demand caused oil prices to crashSo many smaller players went bust in the past few yearsNow things are changing US shale is running out of stream Were not seeing peak oil but a significant decline in supply growth Producers are seeing rapidly declining Tier 1 drilling reserves They focus on free cash flow generation instead of production growth and reward investors through dividends and buybacksThey have learned their lesson  especially in an environment where new climate movements want to put big oil out of businessAs the chart above shows shale production is barely higher than it was prior to the pandemic The only basin with growth left is the Permian the big oneEven that basin is expected to reach peak production in 4Q24With the US losing pricing power OPEC is witnessing a chance to become more powerfulOne of the reasons why oil is back at 90 is aggressive output cuts from OPEC mainly Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants to protect 80 Brent at all costs It also seems to be willing to defend 90 Brent given that they announced an extension of the cutsBecause of the supply squeeze were dealing with an increasing supply shortfall pushing up pricesWe can assume that OPEC is likely playing a political game here While Im obviously not a political insider who knows what for example the Saudis are up to I can imagine what they are doing hereLooking at the chart below we see that crude oil storage levels in the US are way below anything weve seen over the past five years and before thatIncluding the strategic reserves reserves are more than 200 million barrels below their longerterm average Also were going into a major election year I doubt Biden  or any Democrat  wants to buy back oil in this environmentHaving said that demand developments are also favorableAs reported by  on September 14 forecasts from leading energy analysts suggest that global crude oil consumption is on an unstoppable ascentThe International Energy Agency IEA projects a recordbreaking 1022 million barrels per day for this year with a relentless climb to 1057 mbd by 2028Exxon Mobil  also anticipates demand to surge by roughly 75 mbd until it peaks in 2040Whats interesting is that the IEA do not confuse this with the EIA isnt that bullish Its outlook includes barely any demand growth through 2028They do not expect 2018 levels to be reached before 2025 as most consumption is expected to come from natural gas liquids and biofuelsAccording to Bloombergs David Fickling we could be looking at a peak demand scenario for crude oil  despite the overall positive demand picture of fossil fuelsHaving said that I agree with the outlook that fossil fuel demand isnt peaking I do not believe that were anywhere close to a peak as were at the start of massive growth in the middleclass population of India and various African nationsWhile India will make sure to build a future with less dependency on foreign energy learning from Chinas mistakes I do not see a scenario where oil demand turns into a headwind  ignoring cyclical recessions that happen occasionally Im talking about the bigger pictureOPEC also issued a  on September 14 reacting to the IEAs outlook and commentsAllow me to share a few quotes from OPECs letter I will add emphasis and my own view on thingsOPEC is 100 right here While suggesting that we could peak demand may very well be a wrong thesis actively pushing for fewer investments in oil and gas is a serious issue Were currently finding out what happens when rising demand meets slower supply growth The middle class and everyone below gets squeezedI often make the case that I am not rooting for high energy inflation Although I have close to 20 energy exposure my main concern is the protection of my portfolio as elevated inflation is generally bad for the stock marketThats also why Im writing this articleLastly I agree with OPEC when it comes to alternativesIve been a number of times on Dubaibased Asharq TV where I discussed energy policies My point has always been to use the proceeds from fossil fuels to build alternatives We should NOT cut reliable sources before we have good alternativesThats the biggest mistake were currently makingPutting all things together Im bullish on oil While I do not rule out potential recession risks that could push oil down 20 to 70 Im a buyer on major weakness protecting my portfolio against what I believe will be a longterm uptrend in crude oil I believe that tripledigit dollar prices are likely which could come with a second wave of inflation  especially if the Fed is forced to cut rates at some pointWhile I do not own XLE I believe that XLE is a great way to hedge against energy inflation without having to take on elevated risksIncepted in 1998 XLE is one of the oldest ETFs on the market It has a 010 expense ratio and a quarterly dividend The current yield is 36 which is mainly driven by Exxon Mobil and Chevron  who account for roughly 40 of this ETFFurthermore as the overview above shows investors get access to refiners as well The ETF also includes providers of energy equipment and servicesThis provides some diversificationDespite not having the benefit of owning tech stocks XLE has outperformed the SP 500 by roughly 450 basis points over the past 12 months This includes dividendsAlthough XLE could be a bumpy ride if we enter a recession I expect XLE to keep outperforming the SP 500 for many more yearsThe energy sector is experiencing a remarkable transformation and the signs point towards a sustained bull market in oil Recent developments such as declining US shale production growth and OPECs strategic output cuts have set the stage for higher oil pricesThe supplydemand dynamics are shifting in favor of oil with supply shortages pushing prices upward Contrary to predictions of peak demand global crude oil consumption continues to rise driven by factors like Indias rising middle classWhile there are differing opinions and biases in the energy debate one thing remains clear energy stocks like those in the XLE ETF offer a solid hedge against inflation and a potentially longterm uptrend in crude oil pricesConsidering XLEs history low expense ratio and diverse holdings it presents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to benefit from the energy sectors resurgenceIn my view oil is poised for tripledigit prices and XLE

248,Vonovia: Potentially Rewarding Due To Macro Tailwinds,Note All amounts in the article are in EUR At the current exchange rate 1 EUR is around 105 USDIn line with the German real estate sector Vonovia   has seenI have been buying up German real estate companies since early summer which was a contrarian move I am a big believer in this approach When everybody seems to think everything is bad and can only get worse it is  not always but very often  a good time to start buying I was also following the discussion on Seeking Alpha on German real estate stocks and found the arguments of the bulls much more convincing However I am grateful for the bearish articles because they gave a balanced viewI started investing in almost every publicly listed German real estate company of a reasonable size which was not too dependent on new real estate development I now think it is time to look at companies with significant exposure to new real estate development too I thought it was still too early a few months back and it seems this was the right callI ended up with a large position in Vonovia Grand City Properties  and Aroundtown AANFF I did not intend to have a large position in Aroundtown The company has significant exposure to commercial real estate and is the largest shareholder of Grand City Properties As I own Grand City Properties too it creates a cluster risk and I generally see commercial real estate at the moment as riskier than rental real estate However the stock has gone up more than 90 since I started buying so my Aroundtown position is now sizeable tooI have a smaller position in LEG Immobilien  and did own TAG Immobilien  but I have already sold those shares My position was small and TAG Immobilien went up too quickly over a short period so I did not buy more I usually build up positions over several weeks or months and sometimes longer if the investment thesis does not play out as I think it should but I am still convinced it is correctIn total this investment in German real estate companies is among the best ones I ever made and additionally it played out in a very short timeframe While I went in with conviction in the beginning I admit it was not with a lot of research It is now time to evaluate what the next steps areConventional analysts are not much help here  in my view When I started buying there were Sell ratings with the target prices 1030 above the share price JP Morgan issued a Sell rating for Vonovia at the end of March with a target price of 18 euros The share price was around 15 euros at the time It is not much better now Recently Baader Bank a German broker and investment bank repeated its Buy rating for Aroundtown with a target price of 115 euros The last time Aroundtown traded at or below 115 euros was in July and it is already over 2 euros now So there is a lot of confusion around German real estate companies at least among analystsI did a deeper dive into Vonovia as this is my largest position and I now think that I will be holding on to the stock for maybe one or two more years Once the interest rates environment turns Vonovia should benefit from significant macroeconomic tailwinds I expect the share price to go back to 30 to 40 euros where it was just a year ago a further upside of 4080Vonovia owns 550000 rental apartments Almost 90 of them are in Germany around 40000 in Sweden and 21000 in AustriaHousing construction in Germany is doing miserably There is already a significant supplydemand imbalance and it looks like it will get worse According to the German Statistisches Bundesamt Federal Statistical Office  almost 28 fewer building applications for apartments were issued between January and July this year than in the same period last year For singlefamily homes the numbers are even worse building applications for singlefamily homes were down 365 YoYThe reasons for the lack of new housing construction are obvious increased financing costs due to interest rate developments and high construction costs because of inflationThe official goal of the German government is to create 400000 new housing units every year to cope with the demographic development This is not even that ambitious Since 1950 when the German Federal Republic was founded on average  In 1995 602800 new units were built but in 2022 only 295300 It looks like 2023 and 2024 are going to be even lowerVonovia benefits disproportionally here Firstly  Secondly growth mostly happens in  where Vonovias apartment portfolio is concentrated The top 7 large urban areas Berlin Hamburg Munich Cologne Frankfurt am Main Stuttgart and Düsseldorf account for more than half of the portfolio in GermanyThe situation is so desperate that the local government of Berlin appointed a Commission on the Expropriation of Large Housing Companies in response to a public referendum in September 2021 It came back with the  that this would be legally feasible although owners would need to be compensated The  is that this has a next to zero probability of being executed even if the legal opinion would turn out to be correct This is not assured either In 2019 the City of Berlin introduced a rigorous rent control law called Mietendeckel which was struck down by the German Federal Constitutional CourtAccordingly Vonovias vacancy rate in Germany is at a very low 19 it is 22 including the units in Sweden and Austria The company has  due to rising construction costs and interest rates Recently the  that this could continue into 2024Compared to other countries Germany is a nation of renters  fewer than half of Germans own their own homes Accordingly tenant protections are strong However I find it hard to imagine a situation where the largest provider of rental apartments in Germany is not going to benefit from this supplydemand imbalance in the long run There does not seem to be a quick fixI do not think this is reflected adequately in the share price yet The EPRA NTA net tangible asset value per share was 4967 euros at the end of H1 compared to a current share price of around 22 eurosA related topic is rent growth Inflation and rent growth are strongly correlated but with a time lag Vonovias most recent investor presentation includes the following graph to illustrate the pointWhen inflation accelerates rent growth initially lags because implementation is delayed by factors like regulatory constraints However rents are expected to grow faster and for longer once the inflationary pressure has subsidedIn  the 12M rolling organic rent increase was 35 compared to 34 in H1 2022 however the rental EBITDA grew by 78 YoY due to reduced expenses and maintenance costs According to management it should reach between 36 and 39 by the end of the yearWhile accelerating rental growth is still below inflation  for now and it looks like this could change sooner rather than later In September 2023  slowed to 45 significantly down from August when it was still 61Vonovia has three core debt KPIsDue to the writedowns in Q1 and Q2 the LTV is now 472 and Net DebtEBITDA multiple is at 16 The only KPI above the target is the ICR which was 47So Vonovia is breaching two out of the three KPIsWhile this is not great I would argue that Vonovia has managed the downturn reasonably well so farThe company has enough liquidity and all debt maturities are covered until the end of 2024 But It will need to refinance or pay back around 45bn euros of debt every year between 2025 and 2030 An investment grade credit rating and a revolving credit facility of 3bn euros which was extended until 2026 in Q2 should help but I assume that further disposals are necessary In its  Vonovia says it is working on a JV in Northern Germany with a fair value similar to the sold Südewo portfolio  so around 1bnVonovia usually pays out 70 of Group FFO as a  As is common for German and European companies this is once per year To preserve liquidity the payout was halved this year but the dividend yield was still around 5 at the payout time in JuneMost other German real estate companies skipped their dividend this year so Vonovia stands out The cash out was further reduced to around 373mn euros as the company has a scrip dividend program in place and 45 of shareholders took advantage of that For reference  the total FFO was 1944mn in 2022 and 9486mn so far in H1 2023 95 YoYAs Vonovia has breached two of its debt KPIs this year due to the writedowns a dividend payout next year is not assured even though there would be ample room for one given the expected FFO However management is still guiding for a 70 payout The expected FFO per share for the full year is 215239 euros So the dividend yield would be between 68 and 76 based on a share price of 22 eurosEven if a dividend payout does not happen investors should keep the scrip dividend in mind It is a nice way to avoid the German dividend withholding tax The process is bureaucratic for retail investors and from my own experience I know it can take up to two years For that to work investors should not buy the ADR sharesAs earnings were negative in H1 2023 due to the writedown it is better to look at funds from operations to see how the valuation looks compared to the operational performance FFO per share was 1914 in H1 2023 so around 95 on an annualized basis This is not expensive and significantly below the historic average of around 20 over the last 5 years from 2018 to 2022But it is in line with other German rental real estate companies LEG Immobilien comes to 2036 based on the H1 FFO and TAG Immobilien to 1964 Only Grand City Properties is lower with 1571The companies are also comparable regarding their NTA values per share compared to the share price while all have a low number Vonovia is at 045 LEG Immobilien at 046 TAG Immobilien a little higher at 053 and Grand City Properties again lower at 034The difference in valuation is because Grand City Properties has appreciated much less YTD than the other threeMy takeaway here is that Vonovias valuation will probably only improve in line with the real estate sector and real estate prices Once the macroeconomic environment for the sector improves I think shares will go back to a range between 3040 euros So I intend to hold at least until shares reach 30 euros and I realize that this could take at least one to two yearsI own both Vonovia and Grand City Properties but my position in Vonovia is larger This is because of the difference in company size and the resulting difference in risk Vonovia is part of the German DAX index and has a market cap of 1839bn euros Grand City Properties is much smaller with just 175bnThe biggest risk is the interest rate environment If interest rates stay higher for longer the investment thesis is still correct in my view As I consider the longterm macroeconomic environment favorable for Vonovia it will just take longer to play outA further need to write down the value of its assets is another risk This would be bad for the share price but Vonovia also has an additional covenant risk on its debtThe need for further writedowns could arise if prices go down more but it is also possible that there is already a mismatch between what Vonovia thinks its assets are worth currently and what the real market prices areThis does not seem to be the case though Vonovia has written down the value of its real estate portfolio by around 11 since the peak in June 2022 This looks to be at least in line with where market prices went According to the numbers from  which are based on actual market transactions for new and existing buildings prices have declined by an average of 99 in that period There are regional differences so Destatis segments the numbers into five categories from rural to larger cities where Vonovia has most of its apartments In the top 7 large urban areas Berlin Hamburg Munich Cologne Frankfurt am Main Stuttgart and Düsseldorf prices for apartments fell by 98 in Q2 2023 compared to the same quarter of the previous year Therefore I think the depreciation Vonovia applied to its portfolio is adequate and gives maybe even some cushionThat does not mean prices cannot go down further However the downturn in Q2 2023 was already significantly weaker when compared quarterly compared to the first quarter of 2023 residential properties were 15 cheaper in the two previous quarters the QoQ decline was significantly higher at 29 and 51 respectivelyIn the  from September 28 so quite recently Vonovia says it is too early to give an H2 valuation guidance but notes that based on the Q2 valuation there is a 25 headroom for compliance with bond covenants not considering any positive impact from further rent growth and disposalsMy takeaway here is twofold First prices can go down further in the short term but probably not significantly Second it would take a very drastic macroeconomic shock for prices to go down a further 25 and for Vonovia to breach its debt covenantsLonger term the dynamics of supply and demand point to rising prices and rising rentsOnce the interest rate environment turns Vonovia should benefit from significant macroeconomic tailwinds This could not happen in 2023 but I assume sometime in 2024We have seen the share price above 50 euros in the past However I do not think we will get there anytime soon again Those prices were driven by basically free money and those days are over for now However I expect that over the next two years the share price could go back to 30 to 40 euros where it was just a year ago an upside of 4080 from where the shares are nowEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks

249,Could We See $100 Oil In 2023?,Goods things finally appear to be happening for energy bulls After languishing in mediocrity over the first half of 2023 oil prices now appear to be recovering and could well be setting up for another leg higher WTIAs it stands the fundamental outlook for the market appears quite constructive for the second half of 2023 and should these bullish factors remain in place a rally to 90bbl or even as high as 100 is not out of the questionStarting with the physical market crude oil inventories have flirted with both builds and draws for much of the year  giving little fundamental signal in theThis was the largest weekly drawdown of US crude oil inventories since the data was first recorded in 1982 And as we can see below not only does this appear bullish on an absolute basis but also on a seasonally adjusted basisFor crude oil analysing inventory changes and inventory levels provides a decent realtime proxy for the supply and demand dynamics within the market Should this record drawdown be a sign of things to come this bullish turn in inventories should continue to support prices for the months aheadIn similar fashion to changes in inventory levels the shape of the crude oil futures curve provides valuable insight to the ongoings within the physical marketAlthough the actual prices of the various futures contracts are themselves not useful predictors of future prices the shape of the futures term structure does provide valuable information into the underlying fundamentals of the oil market and is another excellent indicator of the status of the physical market GenerallyAgain similar to inventories the term structure has provided mixed signals for much of the year as it has flirted with backwardation and contangoAs it stands the curve now resides in firm backwardation across the board though not the same degree as was seen during 2021 and early 2022 Nonetheless this remains a bullish outcome for now as the market looks to be becoming increasingly tighter as we enter the second half of 2023Prompt and longerdated time spreads are also confirming this dynamic Both are sitting firmly in backwardation and confirming the recent move higher in WTIMeanwhile US crack spreads for refined products such as diesel jet fuel and gasoline have all also moved higher in line with the recent rally in crude thus confirming the tightness in the market as indicated by the backwardated term structure Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined productsFrom a positioning perspective everyone and their dog has been either short or bearish oil for quite some time now so there has been and remains still plenty of scope for a sustained positioning driven squeeze higherIndeed the managed money component of the futures market ie hedge funds and CTAs recently had their smallest exposure to oil in almost a decade as recently as early July And while their buying activity has fuelled much of the rally thus far there remains plenty of scope for speculators to drive prices higher stillLikewise total speculative positioning as a percentage of open interest remains close to favourable contrarian levels despite the recent rallyIn terms of the supply and demand outlook for oil it appears we could see deficits return to the market throughout the second half of the year if they are not already present Though I view their forecasts with a grain of salt the EIAs projections suggest global demand will exceed production by 098 mm bpd deficit in Q3 followed by an additional shortfall of 038 mm bpd in Q4Similar projections are being made by commodity analysts at Standard Chartered who  suggesting a  Likewise the IEA have also recently revised upward their demand forecasts and now predict a 17 mm bd shortfall through 2H23While demand overall still lags its preCOVID trend it has recently hit an alltime high As  by Bloombergs Javier Blas  Whether we like it or not it continues to look increasingly apparent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar lack the efficacy efficiency and base load capacity to replace fossil fuels so it stands to reason peak oil demand is still likely decades awayOn the supply side Saudi Arabia have confirmed they will extend voluntary production cuts through September this puts the cumulative effects of Saudis total production cuts over the past year or so at around 3 mm bd meaning their overall production is now around 9 mm bd below their estimated maximum of 12 mm bd Meanwhile Russia have also suggested they plan to cut exports by 300000 bd by next month after already agreeing to reduce exports by 500000 bd in AugustIt seems increasingly the case Saudi Arabia have now positioned themselves as the worlds swing producer of crude oil given the lack of investment in US shale of late This is likely a dynamic the Saudis will continue to leverage in the short term as they have hinted that current cuts could be extended or even deepened While Saudi Arabias production cuts are largely responsible for the supply shortfall we are likely to see throughout the second half of 2023 such supply shortages  coupled with reasonably strong demand  suggest the market will remain tight at least through the next quarterFrom a technical perspective the picture has improved dramatically this past month WTI looks to have broken out of its downward ascending wedge pattern that has been slowly developing over the last year whilst also breaking through key moving averages As it stands the 82 level looks to be key resistance for now and whether or not we can break through this level will be very informative as to how sustainable any potential 2H23 rally can beFrom a seasonality perspective the outlook remains favourable for the next quarterOn the whole the outlook for the oil market over the second half of 2023 looks quite bullish Market technicals trend and seasonality look to be taking a turn for the better while fundamental indicators of the physical market such as the term structure inventories and crack spreads also look to be leaning toward the bullish side of the equationUltimately there appears plenty of scope for higher prices in the coming months But while I remain very bullish oil over the long term and expect to see prices reach midtriple digits at some point in the future I am skeptical that this will occur in 2023Indeed there are a number of factors at play which could put a ceiling on prices in the medium term For one as discussed earlier much of the supply shortages seen in the market today are a result of Saudis numerous production cuts Should prices spike to the 90100bbl level it seems likely they will once again ramp up production to take advantage of these higher prices Whats more while Chinese oil consumption has disappointed this year we have seen the Chinese work to significantly increase their commercial and strategic stockpiles in recent months and history suggests they could release these barrels onto the market should prices rise sufficiently And finally while the economy remains robust for now the  for economic growth continues to appear subpar which may or may not impact demand in late 2023 to early 2024 Either way the second half of the year looks to be an existing one for energy bulls The summary bullets for this article were

250,"Phillips 66 Vs. Valero Energy: One Is A Buy, And One Is Not",In the last 60 days the refining segment has seen strong gains So much so that  have downgraded the entire group based mainly on valuation and risk ofThe viewpoints expressed at Bank of America make sense on the surface After a nice run and the continuance of historically high crack spreads the group could take a beating if margins regress to historical levels However all refiners are not created equal In fact when looking at the three biggest refiners in the US Marathon Valero and Phillips 66 you will find three different business structuresIn this article I will discuss two refiners Phillips 66  and Valero As a whole the refinery industry has gotten smaller since the pandemic Total refinery capacity has actually shrunk to 2014 levels as a result of under investment in the industry  We are now entering the hangover period from the pandemic The pandemics sudden shock to the industry has resulted in refiners closing up shop and those who stayed in business put off large maintenance projects to stay afloat This has shifted the supply and demand balance resulting in higher rates for refiners These new rates have allowed refiners to post outstanding numbers over the last 1218 monthsSince greenfield refineries arent exactly appealing in the public eye and electric vehicles are becoming more ingrained in the transportation industry the industry has shifted its investment focus The big players are now focusing growth initiatives on renewable diesel for both its environmental and economic benefitsTo that end several companies aim to start up renewable diesel projects to capture the high margins that are offered by renewable credits more on that later for producing renewable diesel Below are some of the notable renewable diesel projects in the worksAs with most things the market takes some time to respond to these incremental changes Currently the EIA projects the 321 crack spread to remain elevated for 2023 before settling back to a slightly elevated level by 2024Does all of this point toward the demise or at least regression of the refinery sector Lets dive in to VLO and PSX to find outVLO is a moderately sized company with a market cap of 46 billion just a bit smaller than PSX 50 billion VLO is also a highly visible brand with its logo on top of over 7000 gas stations nationally VLO also has 15 refineries and a renewable fuels segment The renewable fuels group consists of two renewable diesel facilities and 12 ethanol plantsWhen I look at Valeros  I see a lot of discussion points regarding their renewable diesel technology the Green Diamond Diesel brand and ethanol production These could easily be dismissed as admirable endeavors with minimal possibly negative economic value As with any renewable initiative in an investing format the measuring stick will always be how much green it can generate and how do these assets stack up against traditional refineriesBelow you will find Valeros Q2 10K report You can see that after impressive growth from 2022s numbers the renewable diesel and ethanol groups accounts for 12 of the companies operating income up from approximately 5 in 2022 While not an overwhelming number it is certainly a contributing factor to the companys bottom lineIn my opinion the VLO investor presentations do a poor job representing the renewable fuels potential To get our facts straight I like to put my engineer hat on and let the numbers speak for themselves The table below displays overall profitability for each segment Based on the above data is it very evident that the renewable fuels fetch a considerable premium compared to conventional refining although at much smaller volumes Before we jump on the renewable bandwagon we need to understand how renewables are incentivized and what risks are involvedDiamond Green Diesel is VLOs brand for renewable diesel In the 4th quarter of 2022 VLO completed its third DGD unit at Port Arthur The premium generated by this product results from the multiple credit sources the government has established to spur its production As shown below the price of RINs LCFS credits and BTC credits all play into the margin generated by DGDIt is important to note that currently LCFS credits are only offered in the states of California Oregon and Washington and thus the addressable market is relatively small The pricing mechanism for these credits is affected by the number of credits produced by low carbon sources and the number of credits consumed ie penalized by high carbon sources Therefore this pricing mechanism could deteriorate as more renewable projects come online and replace high carbon fuel sourcesMore detail can be found at the The remaining price mechanisms for renewable diesel are the  and the  BTC Both of these programs are administered at the federal government level Similar to LCFS credits RIN credits fluctuate based on supply and demand that is created by government established criteriaFrom the graph below right side you can see that the entire monetary value of renewable diesel is based purely on government subsidies with the feedstock costs significantly exceeding the selling price of the basic diesel commodity Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD Ultimately dollars are dollars so I choose not to judge the source It is important however to understand the origination of profitThe ethanol group is by far the smallest of the three segments But Valero has big plans for the small unit again intending to capitalize on the governments various incentive mechanisms It intends to do this via the combination of LCFS credits and by connecting the ethanol plants to a CO2 sequestration pipelineVLO plans to connect eight of its 12 ethanol plants to a common pipeline to support CO2 capture This entitles the company to the  invoked by the Biden administration The 45Q tax credit is expected to contribute an additional 025 per gallon uplift when the pipeline enters service in late 2024 This credit combined with the LCFS credits pose to significantly boost the profitability of the ethanol group by roughly 100 to 300 million on a quarterly basisGiven all the above data there is certainly opportunity for Valero to continue to boost overall profitability based on various government incentives However given the general size of both the DGD and ethanol segments this most likely will not be sufficient to sustain the companys current performance should crack spreads decline as we enter 2024Therefore I believe VLO will face downward pressure in the medium term This is based on two assumptions1 Additional renewable projects come online that reduce the value of government incentives RBN Energy has a very detailed discussion of this risk in its series 2 The gradual adoption of electric vehicles will erode demand or at least hamper meaningful growth for conventional transportation fuels This will gradually reduce crack spreads over time I dont believe the pace of the EV transition will be sufficient enough to pose any near term risk I view this transition as gradual becoming more impactful over the course of a decadePSX has a slightly smaller capacity and retail presence than VLO coming in at just shy of 2 billion BPD refining capacity with around 2500 gas stations What I like about PSX is its diversification and not relying solely on refining In the chart below you can see that refining only accounts for about 50 of its income The remainder is spread amongst its midstream segment marketing and chemical businessesGlobally the transition to cleaner burning fuels centers around the use of natural gas methane andor similar natural gas liquids such as propane butane and ethane Europe and Asia are consuming these fuels at an accelerating rate with a large percentage of it being sourced from the United States This is where PSXs midstream business shinesPSX recently completed the transaction to boost its  in DCP midstream to 868 at the end of Q2 of this year Following the DCP acquisition the company owns or operates 72000 miles of pipeline to transport products such as crude oil refined products NGLs or Natural Gas to its export terminals This allows the company to extract profits at every phase of the value chain from the wellhead to the docks making it ideal for energy producers to transport using the PSX systemI am extremely bullish on LNG and NGL exports beginning to ramp significantly over the next 1218 months  for liquefied natural gas is expected to come online by the end of 2024 with additional projects still in the pipeline This initial wave of projects accounts for nearly a 75 increase in US exportsIncreased demand for midstream services will allow for margin expansion This will enable PSX to have a thriving secondary business that provides solid and dependable cash flows More importantly since midstream businesses are generally fee based with only slight commodity exposure they can hedge against declining refining marginsIn the first quarter of 2024 PSX is expected to start up the Rodeo Renewed unit which is a conversion of the original refinery into a renewable diesel unit As mentioned earlier in the current market this carries significant potential for high margin production PSX targets an annual EBITDA of 700 million from this project once it is operationalThis project will be important for PSX to meet its stated projection to return 45 billion to 65 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024  I showed that even taking conservative numbers for the Rodeo Renewed project and factoring in a 40 decline in refining margins PSX should still be able to beat the high end of their return package guidancePSX has overall less exposed to pure refinery risks than VLO This is mostly attributed to the presences of its midstream business in DCP which provides a powerful diversification toolAdditionally PSX is on track to complete an extremely large renewable diesel project in Rodeo Renewed As mentioned earlier this has the potential for very high margins in the near term As with VLO I do feel the renewable diesel industry may see margin contraction due new supplies coming onlineAnother important comparison point would be the overall health of each companys balance sheet The table below shows a stark difference in debtcash profiles between the twoPSX clearly will have some debt obligations to tend to over the next several years that could rob meaningful cashflow unless refinanced out into the future Conversely VLO is sitting in a very solid position with more than enough cash on hand to meet all debt obligations for the next three years with ease VLO certainly has the edge in this regardSource VLOPSX Quarterly and Annual 10K reportsObviously the common risk to both of these companies is declining crack spreads With several incremental projects coming online in the next several quarters it is possible crack spreads drop in response to the supply increase In this scenario the overall profitability of both companies would drop back to more historical levelsI believe PSXs current business structure helps preclude much of this risk by having alternative forms of income from its midstream business that is inherently stable Further the midstream business focuses on natural gas resources that is in high demand around the globe This attribute is key to my thesis that PSX is a more stable long term investment than VLOA secondary risk to both companies is declining government incentives to produce renewable diesel as several new projects come online A reduction in incentives will clearly impact these high margin products as they are not economically viable without this aid due to high feedstock costs Due to the relatively small volumes of renewable diesel neither company has sufficient exposure at this time to dramatically alter the course of the business However any anticipated growth aspects would be muted in this scenarioIn this article we reviewed the operational differences between VLO and PSX Despite both being large scale refiners their business structure is significantly different with VLO almost entirely focused on refining and PSX diversified with midstream and chemical segments However VLO does have an upper hand in its balance sheet and near term debt requirementsThe BoA thesis surely has merit but is more applicable to VLO than PSX due to the latters diversification from refining This diversification provides for a safety net should crack spreads drop over the medium to long term I therefore in spite of the comparably inferior balance sheet find PSX to be a more desirable long term investment than VLO Further PSX should have sufficient cash flows to manage its near term debt obligations I previously included PSX in my  for a look into how I view its purpose in a dividend portfolio   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being

251,Uber: Profitable For Now,Ubers  business has finally achieved profitability on the back of higher margin advertising revenue and a more favorable competitive environment While the cost discipline demonstrated by the company in recent years is admirable Uber must find avenues to support growthUber is currently facing a highly variable demand environment with postpandemic normalization leading to increased demand for mobility services partially offset by a softening of demand for delivery In addition freight markets have been weak due to a decline in consumer spending on products and a supply chain bullwhip effect Some of this demand variability should begin to even out in coming quarters leading to a further moderation in headline growthFrom a competition perspective Ubers main markets continue to be dominated by two players although competition appears to be easing The rapid shift in interest rate environment over the past 18 months is likely at least partly responsible for the improvement in profitability in ride sharing The increase in the cost of capital has caused ridesharing companies to pull back on spendingLyft was not competitive on pricing but this has changed over the past 12 months Uber now believes that its pricing is generally comparable to Lyfts Despite this Ubers share of gross bookings continues to be at or Much of Ubers current efforts are focused on providing a greater range of services so that it can maximize revenue and profits For exampleThis portfolio of products is currently at an  gross bookings run rate and is growing over 80 YoY Uber also offers a range of service levels that help with price discrimination like Uber Black and Uber Comfort Offering a range of products across price points should help to drive growth and profitability albeit at the expense of consumer surplusUbers new products are also extending the company from its traditional ridesharing background into more general transportation services Uber now offers highcapacity vehicles at a low price point through its Uber Shuttle service These vehicles that can support  at a time running on fixed routes and timings across several cities in India Mexico Brazil and Egypt In the UK Uber recently added the ability to book Ubers growth is also being supported by a number of international markets Germany Spain Japan Korea Turkey Argentina amongst others which are providing high growth with Uber referencing a pool of bookings worth around  growing over 100 YoYMembership is another focus area for Uber as it promises to reduce churn and increase user spending While this may be a near term headwind for the business increasing user LTVCAC ratios will be critical driver of improved profitability in the long run Uber One members are profitable but margins are lower because Uber is incentivizing members This is offset by the fact that  on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50 greater than nonmember retention Uber currently has something like  with membership numbers doubling YoY and around 25 of the companys gross bookings come from memberships Uber is also trying to upsell monthly members to an annual membershipAdvertising is another important area of Ubers business as it provides an incremental source of growth and has high margins Ubers advertising business currently has an annual run rate of over  with a 1 billion USD target for 2024 This appears to be a solid revenue stream as well with Uber suggesting a return on ad spend in the 79x range Most of the advertisers on the platform are SMBs although Uber is trying to increase penetration amongst CPG companies enterprise customers and companies like Apple The economics of this business are not really known at the moment and Uber is likely investing fairly heavily in attracting advertisers and developing its ad product but it seems likely that growth of the advertising business is in large part responsible for Ubers transition to profitabilityWith its recent transition to profitability Uber is having its moment in the sun but investors should not forget that the transportation delivery and freight markets are likely to face a serious shakeup over the next decade with the rollout of autonomous vehicles gaining steam It should also be noted that Ubers revenue likely follows a power law distribution across cities meaning that only a relatively small number of important locations need to be disrupted by robotaxis for Ubers business to begin to struggleAVs could lead to more riders as it will lower mobility costs but depending on how the market evolves it could increase competition or result in Uber being disintermediated completely Uber has partnered with Waymo amongst other companies and believes that it can be a routing layer between supply and demand allocating demand to autonomous partners when it makes sense This vision will likely require that the supply of robotaxis is fairly diffuse with a number of competing service providers If there are only 12 service providers Uber is likely to be disintermediated At this stage it seems prudent to assume that AVs will be a fairly concentrated market The technology is complex and the heavy reliance on data creates global economies of scale There are also likely to be significant economies of scale involved in building and maintaining a fleet of vehicles which supports the development of a concentrated marketThe robotaxi threat is likely to take time to play out though due to the complexities involved in developing the technology regulatory uncertainty and safety concerns Despite this progress is being made and appears to have accelerated in the last 12 years  its fully autonomous taxi service citywide in San Francisco after being spun out from Alphabet in 2016 and initially offering services in a public trial in Phoenix in 2017 Waymo and Cruise both recently received approval from Californias Public Utilities Commission to charge riders for autonomous rides without a safety driver day and night Cruise has announced testing in 14 new cities and is targeting 1 billion USD revenue in 2025 Seattle San Diego Miami Nashville Raleigh Charlotte Atlanta and Washington DC Dallas and Houston are A wider spread rollout of robotaxis is an interesting development as it will provide a greater volume and variety of data which should lead to improved performance Commercialization also provides cash flow which will help to support the development of businesses that have so far been a black hole for cash For example Waymo reportedly spent at least  on autonomous vehicle development between 2009 and 2015 This could also represent an inflection point in the market as Cruises CEO has suggested that the underlying technology is now adapting relatively quickly to new environmentsIt is also a risky period though as the proliferation of robotaxis is raising awareness of both the pros and cons of the technology If large scale data demonstrates adequate performance the regulatory environment is likely to become more favorable A widespread rollout could also lead to coordinated action on regulations High profile incidents that anger the broader population have the potential to set the technology back thoughA  of Waymos autonomous vehicles led by Swiss Re suggested that they are safer than humandriven vehicles supporting broader adoption of the technology Based on over 38 million miles driven by Waymo without a human behind the wheel there were zero bodily injury claims and a significant reduction in the frequency of property damage claims Swiss Re believes that the results are highly significant but given a human driver baseline of 111 bodily injury claims per million miles more data may be needed to be sure In addition it is likely extremely difficult to compile data for humans and robotaxis where the vehicles face similar risk environments adding to uncertainty in any analysisWhile the technology is improving it has not all been smooth sailing for autonomous vehicles in recent years with Cruise facing the ire of protestors as well as scrutiny from incidents with pedestrians and emergency vehicles  its Via selfdriving truck ambitions although the reason for this is unknown A number of employees have been laid off and the timeline for commercialization has been pushed back Waymo plans to continue working with Daimler on a driverless truck thoughAfter a period of distortion caused by the pandemic Ubers growth is rapidly approaching the singledigit level Revenue increased roughly 14 YoY in the second quarter down from approximately 29 in the first quarter Between pricing frequency and users Uber believes it can maintain doubledigit growth thoughUber has stated that drivers are currently the  As a result the company is trying to add more drivers and improve retention and engagement Uber believes that labor environment is now looser than it has been with around 70 of drivers stating that theyre using Uber due to inflationary pressuresUser growth is rapidly returning to its preCOVID trend with no real sign of a slowdown in sight In Ubers developed markets less than  aged over 18 have ever used Uber potentially providing a significant growth runwayAverage frequency is still down from preCOVID levels but it is difficult to know whether this is just due to a shift in the user base Spend per trip is up significantly which more than offsets the lower frequencyTake rates are up although Ubers Mobility take rate is elevated by the UK merchant model with the company stating that the underlying take rate in the  driven lower by supply investments in international markets like LatAm and APACUbers profitability has been improving rapidly in recent periods with the company having a  The improvement in profitability is being driven by a shift in revenue mix operational efficiency and operating cost controlFor example algorithmic improvements have led to something like a  over the last year The rapid growth of Ubers advertising business has also been a significant margin tailwind Some of these improvements have been offset by weakness in freight and shipping markets though Insurance costs are also significant for Uber and have been rising sharply In response Uber has  in certain markets The merit of an investment in Uber at this point is heavily dependent on how much the company can increase its profit margins and whether robotaxis begins to negatively impact the business at some point If Uber can eventually raise its profit margins to the midteens it would be fairly attractively priced at the moment I think there is a high probability that a strong drive for margins will eventually result in consumer pushback or increased competition thoughI also feel that over a 510 year timeframe there is a reasonable probability of autonomous vehicles beginning to negatively impact Ubers business making an investment in Uber a highrisk proposition While this view has a high chance

253,Safe Bulkers: A Dry Bulk Shipping Value Opportunity,Editors note Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Christos Kolorizos as a new contributor Its easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium Safe Bulkers Inc  presents a compelling investment proposition currently trading at a substantial 38 discount to its target price and 24 below its recent 52week high Notably its PE and PNAV ratios significantly outshine those of industry peers My Buy recommendation is underpinned by the companys robust financial health and enticing valuation This opportunity is nothing short of substantial for valueminded investors seeking exceptional potential I recommend considering an investment in Safe Bulkers for the long term as the stock boasts remarkable prospects for significant gainsSafe Bulkers is a global dry bulk shipping company that specializes in the transportation of bulk cargoes including grain iron ore and coal The company maintains a fleet comprising Panamax Kamsarmax PostPanamax and Capesize class vessels It is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the ticker symbol SE and its corporate headquarters are located in GreeceThe company currently operates a fleet of 45 dry bulk vessels with an average age of 106 years including Capesize PostPanamax Panamax and Kamsarmax vessels Given that the global dry bulk fleet age averages approximately 11 years the company is in a favorable position Additionally the company plans to expand its fleet by adding five more Kamsarmax vessels by 2025 On October 6 2023 the company announced that it had entered into contracts to acquire two dualfuel Kamsarmax vessels set to be delivered in 2027 These new vessels have been designed to meet EEDI requirements The companys robust newbuilding program for fleet renewal has already delivered 12 new vessels since 2019 firmly establishing the company as a modern and forwardlooking player in the dry bulk industryAccording to BIMCOs  report it is anticipated that global dry bulk cargo volume will expand by 15 to 25 in 2023 and by 1 to 2 in 2024 The expected increase in average haul for 2023 ranging from 05 to 15 is primarily driven by sanctions on Russian coal and increased shipments of iron ore and grain from BrazilIn October the International Monetary Fund IMF  forecasting a 3 growth rate for the global economy in both 2023 and 2024 While this marks a slight improvement from their previous forecast it remains notably below the average annual growth rate of 37 witnessed throughout the 2010s I would argue that the prevalent issue of inflation persists as a significant concern in several economies necessitating central banks to undertake interest rate increases a measure that has the potential to impede economic growthThe IMF has projected that Chinas GDP will experience growth rates of 52 in 2023 and 45 in 2024 surpassing the Chinese governments target of 5 for 2023 Nevertheless since June there has been a noticeable deterioration in Chinas economic conditions leading to apprehensions In response several banks have revised their forecasts downward with Barclays in particular  falling below the governments targetGlobal iron ore shipments are expected to grow by 25 to 35 in 2023 and 1 to 2 in 2024 In China steel production has risen by 35 this year driven by higher steel exports leading to a slight buildup in steel inventories However weak domestic steel demand due to a decline in new real estate projects could further decrease demand in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 Chinese iron ore imports have exceeded steel production with imports growing by 69 between January and July potentially leading to some inventory rebuilding in China Excluding China global steel production fell by 33 between January and July impacting iron ore shipments due to lower import demand from China and competition from Chinese steel exports Additionally steel production in regions like Japan South Korea and Europe faced challenges including high energy prices and low domestic demandChina is one of the main drivers of the dry bulk market As  Chinese stocks rose a report on October 11 that a  I think this will give the push needed for the countrys construction industry which is a positive sign for the dry bulk sectorAs per the International Energy Agencys assessment there is a potential for global coal demand to experience a 04 increase in 2023 reaching an alltime high followed by a slight decrease of 01 in 2024 There is also a potential for continued growth in Chinas coal imports in 2024 driven by the cost advantage of imported coal over domestically mined sources Furthermore should India effectively enhance its domestic coal production this has the potential to expedite the decline in global coal shipments during the same yearThe anticipated expansion of the dry bulk fleet is forecast to be 28 in 2023 and 21 in 2024 Nevertheless it is noteworthy that supply growth may remain constrained at a range of 12 during both 2023 and 2024 primarily attributed to reduced sailing speeds Due to this fleet productivity is expected to decline by 12 in 2023 and 0515 in 2024 I believe the dry bulk shipping market outlook for 202324 is mixed with demand expected to grow slightly but supply also forecast to increase albeit at a slower pace This suggests a slight tightening of the supplydemand balance but I am concerned that a probable lowdemand scenario could lead to a weakening of the equilibriumAverage dry bulk freight rates have been on the decline since the second half of 2022 In August the Capesize segment was the only category to witness an improvement in freight rates compared to the previous year This improvement was driven by increased volumes and average hauls in iron ore and bauxite shipments as well as a modest 22 yearonyear growth in the Capesize fleet In contrast all other smaller segments saw rate reductions due to decreased grain volumes limited growth in minor bulk volumes and an average 35 yearonyear expansion of the fleet Reduced growth in iron ore shipments and declining coal volumes are anticipated which may negatively affect the shipping sectorWith China being one of the main markets of the dry bulk segment its recent slowdown has raised concerns for me However I am cautiously optimistic that the Chinese governments new stimulus package could boost demand for construction materials and support the dry bulk sector Overall I believe that the dry bulk shipping market is likely to remain challenging in 202324 but I see some positive signs such as the Chinese governments new stimulus package and strong coal demand In 2024 from my perspective the freight rates may either hold at similar to 2023 levels based on the supplydemand balanceIn the  the company experienced a 19 drop in revenues compared to the previous year This decline was attributed to 30 lower timecharter equivalent rates and a larger number of vessels exposed to the spot market EBITDA decreased by 38 and Net Income declined from 87 million in 2022 to 35 million in 2023 These results were primarily due to increased financing expenses resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in operating expenses due to inflation Over the last 5 years the company has also been steadily reducing its leverage which currently stands at 60 based on the latest financial statements Furthermore the companys Net Asset Value NAV has been consistently increasing at an annual rate of approximately 10 over the past 5 yearsSafe Bulkers is wellpositioned to benefit from current market conditions Although I do not expect to see a significant improvement in the market as indicated in the analysis above the stock still holds strong upside potential In 2024 only 24 of the total fleet will be under contract leaving the remaining 76 to be deployed on the spot market In my view earnings for 2023 are anticipated to be lower than those in 2022 due to lower spot rates and increased market exposure as a substantial portion of the fleets time charters expire in September However in the short term the  since the end of August However this increase is primarily supported by the  an expected cyclical upside for the Capesize segment which has risen from below 1000 points to above 3000Key Assumptions and Valuation Methodology as of the valuation date October 9 2023 Enterprise Value EV is determined through a combination of the Discounted Cash Flow DCF method Net Asset Value NAV analysis and Market Multiples These three methods are weighted at 60 20 and 20 respectively The terminal value is calculated as the average between the EVEBITDA multiple and the Discounted Terminal Value which is based on a 1 perpetuity growth rate The Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC is computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM resulting in an average WACC of 11Market Multiples The market multiples used for the valuation are drawn from comparable shipping companies that exclusively operate in the dry bulk sectorCash Flow Projections The valuation accounts for all cash flows until September 2028 In calculating revenue two distinct periods are considered Firstly for the remaining months of 2023 current spot rates are used for uncontracted vessels Secondly for 2024 and beyond freight rates are calculated based on the five and tenyear average 1year Time Charter TC rates for each vessel type amounting to approximately 16000 per day depending on vessel size For any loans maturing before the end of the evaluation period it is assumed that they will be refinanced at prevailing ratesThe company demonstrates significant potential for an upward trajectory with an estimated upside of 38 from the current share price The rates used for the projection are slightly below the companys last reported average rates as the revenue projections are based on the 10year historical averageThe current PE and PNAV ratios are 37 and 29 lower than the market average respectively when compared to peer dry bulk companies This fact lends support to my BUY recommendationI have examined and presented below various sensitivities of the stock price both on WACC and on the projected Charter Rates Before investing in the company please consider the followingValuation I have employed my own assumptions for calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC The addition of a 3 equity premium is a reflection of my personal judgment Its important to note that the weighting of the methods used to calculate the Enterprise Value EV may vary The historical rates used were obtained from  In addition I sourced certain financial data from sources such as Yahoo Finance Wall Street Journal and InfrontAnalyticsShipping Sector Cyclicality The shipping industry is subject to cyclical patterns marked by periods of prosperity and decline These cycles are influenced by the volatile nature of shipping rates which are shaped by shifts in supply and demand Significant drops in shipping rates can negatively impact Safe Bulkers profitability The market outlook considered in this analysis is based on BIMCOs Dry Bulk Outlook ReportMarket Risk Like any stock Safe Bulkers is exposed to global market risk inherent in the equity marketSafe Bulkers is a compelling value play within the dynamic dry bulk shipping sector offering not just potential but a clear path to significant upside The companys combination of a formidable fleet positive earnings outlook and an enticing valuation make it an attractive proposition particularly for valuefocused investors seeking longterm rewardsFrom my vantage point what sets Safe Bulkers apart is its commitment to a modern fleet and a forwardlooking newbuilding program strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the forthcoming improvements in the supplydemand balance across the dry bulk sector extending until the end of 2024 Furthermore the fact that Safe Bulkers is currently trading at a discounted valuation relative to its peers sweetens the deal presenting an attractive entry point for

yearoveryear BEEM is still a microcap company but it seems to be on the right track Yet the stock opened the next day at 1020 and closed at 905General Motors  sales of EVs fell in the second quarter compared to the first quarter The first quarter marked the end of certain US subsidies Ford  recently reduced some of its growth expectations for EVs This is the type of news that makes skittish people think The sky is falling The sky is falling No it isntOne 12week period is not indicative of future sales And this interruption in demand does not mean there is likely to be any pause in seeking new sources of lithium There will be new technologies that make it more efficient howeverThe first step in making LiIon batteries is getting the lithium Lithium is extracted from three different venues brines pegmatites and sedimentary rocks How the lithium is extracted means very different project requirements extraction methods governmental regulation environmental considerations and processing timesHistorically lithium extraction from brine sources has been more economical than production from pegmatite or sedimentary sources Living in Nevada I am geographically close to the action in that Teslas  gigafactory is just down the road from me and Albemarles  Silver Peak mine the only producing lithium brine operation in the US is only a few hours away Often our local news will pick up a story well before the rest of the nation sees it Such was the case for my earliest purchases of Lithium Americas We do not know how much more lithium may be found in the USA  once upon a time America produced the most of any nation Those days are long gone however Now most of the brineevaporation sources of lithium are in different desert areas with dependable solar evaporationThese basins are called salt lakes salt flats or salars Lithium brine deposits represent about twothirds of worldwide lithium resources The best known are found in the salt flats of Chile Argentina and BoliviaEven though most of these reserve deposits are found in The Lithium Triangle of these three nations Australia is the worlds largest lithium producer in total output with much of it coming from the Greenbushes hardrock lithium operation More on that laterAmong many other lithium producers I own shares of Livent  which produces lithium carbonate from a worldclass lithium brine deposit in Argentina the Salar del Hombre Muerto Allkem  an Australian lithium producer is ramping up production at a contiguous site These two companies are currently jumping through various regulatory hoops to be able to merge their assets making it an even bigger factor in brineevaporation lithiumBolivia is likely to have the globes biggest deposit of lithium the Salar de Uyuni which might contain as much as between 50 to 70 percent of known world reserves But the statist government of Bolivia for now anyway insists on government control of all activity  and the Bolivian deposits are more costly to refine and have a much lower evaporation rate anywayGeothermal lithium brine deposits have been much in the news lately Lithium has been found in Chile New Zealand and Iceland as superhot saline is spewed from geothermal sites In this stew are also found good quantities of potassium boron lithium and other elementsI have a personal connection here as well albeit from a more distant time Back in the mists of antiquity I was working my way through UCLA with a dozen or so different jobs One of these was selling lots on the shores of Californias Salton Sea It never became the next Palm Springs just up the road a piece but I thought it had potential so I scraped up the thenmassive chunk of money  1000  to buy a 25acre lot thereI would have done better placing my money in a 2 savings account and compounding it over the intervening period but at least it has kept me interested in the goingson down there There is already significant work being done The Hells Kitchen lithium and power project looks to have an estimated 30year life with a total lithium resource capacity of 300000 metric tons  MT  per year of lithium carbonate equivalent Well seeLithium brine deposits can also be found in some deep oil reservoirs in North Dakota Wyoming Oklahoma Arkansas and East Texas In fact Standard Lithium  claims to hold a property and a unique process on the US gulf coast containing more than 4 million MT of lithium carbonate equivalent resourcesI find this interesting because the oil  gas drillers have significant seismic and 4D technologies already in place  as well as deep pockets Is it possible we will one day get our lithium from these energy companies as wellPegmatite is a coarsegrained igneous rock that is formed from crystallized magma Pegmatite lithium deposits also known as hardrock lithium deposits often contain extractable amounts of not just lithium but also tin tantalum and niobium We most often find the most lithium where mineral spodumene dominatesAustralia produces the most lithium from pegmatite deposits of any country Australian lithium production is on fire with numerous global mining companies elbowing for position Canada the US the Democratic Republic of the Congo and even nations we do not think of as producing lithium like Finland and Ireland hold financially viable pegmatite lithium depositsHardrock ore that contains lithium is extracted at openpit or underground mines using conventional mining techniques The ore is then processed and concentrated in a number of different ways to produce lithium and its compounds This kind of mining is more expensive than using evaporative techniques like brine deposits The good news is that hardrock lithium deposits have higher lithium concentrations than brines making them still economically viable Also producing tin tantalum niobium and more can help offset costsSedimentary deposits account for a growing piece of the lithium pie These are found in clay deposits and lacustrine evaporites Lacustrine just means that these are sedimentary rock formations that formed at the bottom of ancient lakesIn clay deposits lithium is typically found in hectorite which is rich in lithium but also in magnesium The name hectorite comes from a deposit first discovered in Hector CaliforniaMany companies are in the research and development phase for their clay deposits but no companies currently produce meaningful lithium from themThe most commonly known form of lithiumcontaining lacustrine deposit is found in the Jadar Valley in Serbia This deposit is owned by another company in my portfolio one which is not often thought of as a lithium producer Rio Tinto  RIO says it believes this deposit likely contains more than 200 million MT of lithium which would make it one of the largest lithium deposits anywhereIn January 2022 after AngloAustralian RIO had committed to pay more than 2 billion to execute the project Serbia revoked its license The ostensible reason was public protest over environmental concerns It probably did not help matters that Australia deported Serbias favorite son and tennis star Novak Djokovic for failing to comply with Australias Covid19 protocols We shall see if one day royalties to Serbia become more important than other issuesAnother example of sedimentary deposits is yes yet another of my future energy holdings Lithium Americas I have written early and often about the trials and tribulations of trying to extract lithium in this litigious United States of America I first followed LAC as I read reports of the numerous lawsuits to protect the environment in my local newspapers The Lithium Americas site Thacker Pass is a couple of hours northeast of Reno my nearest airport gatewayI find it curious that the voices most demeaning of natures batteries fossil fuels who demand that we replace these forms of energy immediately with green sources are also the loudest in protesting our best opportunity to do so LAC was sued in court by various First Nation tribes by farmers and ranchers and by all manner of organizers and followers from outside the area These lawsuits went on for yearsIf we want green energy we must understand that lithium does not grow on trees that the sun does not shine 247 and that wind turbines are composed of all sorts of metals and materials that must be dug from the ground then at the end of their useful life disposed of by returning much of the dangerous materials with which they are built into the earth and atmosphere TINSTAAFLPossibly bringing closure to this farce is the decision just this week between LAC General Motors which has agreed to offtake some 600 million of LAC production Bechtel Construction and North Americas Building Trades Unions for the Thacker Pass project which will now hopefully tap into the largest deposit of lithium in North AmericaIf you ask me what lithium prices and thus lithium companies will do this week or this month I havent a clue Since China removed incentives to buy electric EV sales there are down That says there is less demand so prices may stay depressed On the other hand if governments or regulators or protesters dead set against disturbing Mother Earth  from Serbia to Bolivia to the USA  prevent adequate supply while demand increases then the shares of lithium producers will rise againI cannot say that a rebound will be immediate I do believe the tale of Lithium Americas having exhausted all opposition all the way to the 9 Circuit Court  yes the 9 Circuit  may create enough precedent that other firms might not face the same uphill battleI dont know exactly when the supplydemand balance will create the momentum to resurrect these companies share prices But I am 100 certain that the balance will shift When it does earnings will increase or explode When that happens the same people now selling because they are going down will be anxious to buy because they are going upI prefer to eliminate those middle steps I own and am continuing to add to my holdings in the very best lithium producers If you want some history there are scores of articles written on SA about these firms You will also find a half dozen or so that I have written detailing in greater depth my belief in every one of these If you are unable to view one you want to see because they are older and no longer available without a

255,First Industrial: Buy The Dip On This Fast-Growing REIT,There are some stocks in growth industries that one can put on the back burner and that may be the case with First Industrial  Its been a while since I last visited the stock It appears that my bullishness around the stock has paid off as the stock has given investors a 166 total return surpassing the 10 rise in the volatile SP 500  over the same timeframeLike most REITs FRs stock price has fallen over the past 30 days but has held up well on a 12month basis with flattish performance In this piece I discuss why growth investors may want to consider buying the stock on the dip so lets get startedFirst Industrial is a selfmanaged REIT that specializes in ownership of distribution centers and light industrial properties across the US with 69 million square feet of industrial space With an equity market cap of 63 billion FR is larger than peer Terreno Realty  smaller than Rexford Industrial  and industry giant Prologis Like its aforementioned peers FR targets large supplyconstrained markets with higher focus on coastal regions As shown below FRs properties are concentrated around 15 target metropolitan statistical areas with a quarter of rents coming from Southern California and a fifth coming from the NortheastUnlike other REIT classes like office properties the industrial segment has seen strong demand and FR is no different with occupancy sitting at a high 977 Moreover FR set a company record cash rental rate increase on new and renewal leases of 74 during the second quarter and this contributed to a robust 11 YoY same store NOI growthThese strong trends are supported by low vacancy rate of just  across the US driven by tailwinds such as ecommerce tenant needs for supply chain diversification as a result from the pandemic and reshoring trends of bringing manufacturing back to the US As shown below FRs high occupancy is in line with that of recent years while its cash rental rate and same store NOI have acceleratedThe supply and demand imbalance is further exacerbated by the fact that many higher leveraged private market developers are priced out due to higher rates FR is wellpositioned to benefit from this dynamic with its strong balance sheet and existing property base in propertyscarce markets along the coasts As shown below industrywide construction starts are down 47 from the peak in the third quarter of 2022 and the number of properties in the construction pipeline industrywide is shrinkingMeanwhile FR carries a strong BBB rated balance sheet with a reasonably low debt  preferred stock to EBITDA ratio of 52x sitting well below the 60x level generally considered safe for REITs by ratings agencies and has a high fixed charge coverage ratio of 50x This gives FR capacity to support its developments with expected completion rates ranging from Q3 FY23 to Q3 FY24 at an attractive weighted average estimated cash yield of 79 across 9 development sites As shown below FR has plenty of development pipeline across its land bank in its existing portfolio giving it plenty of runway in supplyscarce marketsWhile FRs 27 dividend yield isnt particularly high it has grown its dividend every year over the past 5 years with it having grown by 47 since 2018 This has been nearly in lock step with FFOshare which grew by 49 over the same timeframe At the current annual dividend rate of 128 the dividend is wellprotected by a 54 payout ratio leaving plenty of retained capital as a source for internal fundingRisks to FR include the fact that the industrial segment is cyclical in nature and a hard landing resulting in a recession would impact nearly every industry and could suppress rent growth In addition while FR carries a strong balance sheet it isnt immune to higher interest rates which could offset some of the benefits from rental increasesLastly I see value in FR at the current price of 4663 with a forward PFFO of 193 While FR isnt cheap its not expensive either considering its moatworthy property base with plenty of development opportunities its strong balance sheet and recent growth metrics Plus analysts estimate  annual FFOshare growth over the next 3 years and considering the above I believe FR has the potential to trade in the 20 PFFO range which is its normal valuation over the past decadeIn conclusion FR appears to be a strong selfmanaged REIT with its specialized irreplaceable properties in supplyconstrained markets along the coasts and key inland markets I would expect for strong rent growth and occupancy trends to continue due to secular tailwinds in ecommerce reshoring trends the supplydemand imbalance and the companys development pipeline As such investors seeking quality real estate and income ought to consider FR at the current priceGen Alpha has teamed up with to launch the premier incomefocused investing service on Seeking Alpha Members receive  to our articles along with exclusive incomefocused model portfolios

256,I Might Double My Pioneer Natural Resources Investment - Again,I doubt its a surprise to any of my regular readers when I say that Ive been bullish on oil for a while In this case I turned bullish on oil in 2020 as I expected a significant shift in supply andEssentially my thesis has been tightening supply growth and consistent longterm demand growth The end of the US shale revolution OPEC cutting output to protect 80 Brent and geopolitical risks are putting a floor under oil pricesEven the mighty Permian basin in the United States which is the only driver of unconventional oil supply growth is now losing steamThe most recent report showed that declines in legacy production are now more than offsetting production gains from new wells  natural gas remains in an uptrendIf we get peak productionThis is what longterm oil demand might look likeTo prepare for such a scenario I have bought 19 energy exposure which I expect to increase even furtherIm not rooting for elevated inflation I just want to be prepared After all if Im right we could see a development that is negative for the market in general This would also apply to a lot of my other holdingsThe chart below reinforces my view as investments in oil supply remain well below levels that would support rising demand growth This is inflationary especially if demand comes roaring backGiven the shift in supply dynamics I believe that upstream oil companies the ones that drill for oil are the best way to get the job doneIn this case I focus onOne company that checks all boxes is On May 14 I wrote an  titled Thats exactly what I did as the company now accounts for more than 53 of my portfolioIn this article I went with a bullish title again as I want to consolidate my energy holdings Im looking to shift some money from Chevron  into PXD purely because I prefer its aggressive shareholder distribution plansWhile I havent made a final decision on the CVX to PXD shift Ill also deploy new capital as I believe I need to own more oilAnd what better way to buy oil than via PXDSo lets dive into the detailsWith a 55 billion market cap PXD is one of Americas largest onshore oil producers In the second quarter the company produced roughly 370 thousand barrels of oil per day It also produced 341 thousand barrels 48 of equivalentIt has a 05x net leverage ratio with a BBB credit ratingThe company exclusively produces its oil in the Permian basin where it achieved industryleading efficiencyFor example the company not only achieved higherthanexpected production in the second quarter but it is also capable of boosting output with subdued CapExIn the second quarter the company raised its production guidance for the year while reducing the capital budget allocated to drilling completions and facilitiesThe oil production guidance midpoint is now 369 thousand barrels of oil per day and the revised drilling completions and facilities capital budget is 125 million lower than the initial 2023 outlookThis adjustment was attributed to the efficient execution of wellproductivity and operational activities by its teams leading to a more capitalefficient programThe companys investment framework remains aligned with moderate annual production growth of up to 5Furthermore the companys 2023 average well productivity significantly surpassed both 2022 and 2021 levels over the first 24 months of productionAccording to the company its focus on fullstack development enhances longterm recovery and optimizes returnsEssentially the companys substantial inventory of lowbreakeven highmargin locations positions it favorably compared to peers With roughly 15000 toptier locations Pioneer believes it is set for bestinclass development in the years to comeWhile it isnt visible in the chart below the company has more than 20 years worth of toptier drilling which surpasses any of its major peersBut wait the good news continuesThe company is also getting better access to export markets for its natural gas In the second half of this year the company expects to sell 70 of its gas out of the basin Next year that number is expected to be 80 thanks to new pipelines leading to the Houston Ship ChannelIn 1Q23 the company received 19 higher prices for its gas than its peersIn general it has much higher cash margins In 1Q23 the company had cash margins close to 37 per barrel exceeding any of its major peersThanks to these efficiencies the company believes it can generate 27 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next five years at 80 WTI  thats the current oil price27 billion is 49 of its current market cap At 100 WTI that number rises to 40 billion 73Im adding the implied free cash flow yield because the company has a very ambitious capital return planThe company aims to distribute at least 75 of its free cash flow to shareholders through its base dividend the variable dividend and buybacksAt 90 WTI the company has the potential to achieve a doubledigit return yield which would be great for incomefocused investorsOn a longterm basis I expect investors to benefit from total annual dividends exceeding 10For the third quarter payable on September 21 for shareholders of record on September 6 the company is paying 184 per share This consisted of a 125 base dividend and a variable component of 059The annualized yield is 31Please note that the steep drop in its special dividend is likely temporaryNow oil prices are much higher and investment volumes will likely subdueI expect the next dividend announcement to come with a much juicier special dividendIve spent the past few years praising PXD Hence Im happy that PXD is outperforming its peersCompared to prepandemic levels PXD shares have returned 67 compared to five years ago The Energy ETF  and Oil  Gas Exploration  Production ETF  have returned 52 and 2 respectivelyGoing back ten years the performance is somewhat equal at 67 caused by the poor price levels of oil and gas after the 2014 peakGoing forward I expect PXD to continue outperforming its peers and the SP 500 as I believe in prolonged sticky inflation and the tailwinds that come with a new era for oil supply growthHence Im considering buying much more PXD including the proceeds of my successful Chevron investments While I believe that Chevron is one of the bestdiversified energy investments I prefer PXD because of its focus on drilling and high shareholder returnsPlease note that I havent made a final decision I may keep CVX and boost PXD purely using new cashValuationwide I believe that PXD is undervalued This is mainly based on my oil outlook and its potential to generate strong doubledigit free cash flow at elevated oil pricesInvestors will likely recognize that and keep moving funds into the company and its peersThe current consensus price target is 257 which is 9 above the current priceOn a longerterm basis I expect PXD to move well beyond 350 if oil prices go into tripledigit territoryMy bullish outlook on oil has been reaffirmed as supply dynamics shift and demand remains strongThe decline in legacy production and the end of the US shale revolution are bolstering oil prices with the Permian basin losing momentumTo capitalize on this trend Ive increased my energy exposure favoring upstream companies with deep reserves efficient production and healthy balance sheetsPioneer Natural Resources stands out as a prime candidate boasting industryleading efficiency and substantial lowbreakeven locationsWith its strategic focus on shareholder distribution and potential for substantial free cash flow PXD aligns perfectly with my longterm visionWhile I may still decide on the Chevron to PXD shift PXDs reserves the potential for outperformance and special dividends make it a compelling choice in the evolving energy landscapeJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs Preferreds BDCs MLPs ETFs and other income alternatives 438 testimonials and

257,Canadian Natural Resources Is One Of The Best Oil Stocks Money Can Buy, I finally pulled the trigger on a stock Ive had on my watchlist since the day I first researched it Last month I deployed a big portion ofWhen I say that the company behind the CNQ ticker is one of the best oil companies on Earth Im serious CNQ has everything Im looking for in an energy stock This includes deep reserves low breakeven prices a healthy balance sheet a great dividend track record and the aim to distribute almost every penny of excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks Especially at a time when US shale production which was the global supply engine between the Great Financial Crisis and 2021 is running out of momentum I think investors need to be prepared for a prolonged period of elevated energy prices and invest in companies with deep reserves in a time when most are running out of tier 1 drilling inventory Currently the Permian is the only basin in the US capable of strong growth All other major basins have gone sideways since the pandemicNow even the Permian is expected to reach peak production at the end of next year as I discussed in a recent  On top of these bullish secular longterm developments  Arabia is determined to defend 80 Brent by all means necessary which is currently adding to the oil price rally Thats where CNQ comes in Not only do I need investments to protect my portfolio against inflation but its also a terrific income vehicle with the potential to outperform its peers and the market by a wide marginSo lets get to the detailsAs its 65 billion market cap may suggest Canadian Natural Resources is a giant In the second quarter the company achieved a quarterly production of around 119 million BOEs barrels of oil equivalent per day including natural gas production of about 21 bcf per day and production of liquids of roughly 847000 barrels per dayThese numbers were influenced by operational impacts from wildfires in Western Canada thirdparty pipeline outages and planned turnaround activitiesThe wildfires led to temporary shutdowns of some assets between May and July with no significant damage reported Most of the production affected by the wildfires has been restored which is the biggest takeaway when it comes to these fires Furthermore oil production from international assets remained steady Heavy oil production in 2Q23 increased by 15 compared to the prioryear quarter supported by strong drilling results counteracting natural field declinesOperating costs for heavy oil decreased primarily due to lower natural gas fuel costsWith that in mind the company has more than 30 years of proven reserves which beats its average peer by more than ten years Last year the companys new reserves exceeded production which shows that the company has way more than 30 years worth of highquality production which protects it against forced MA deals down the road  the same cannot be said about a wide range of peers Adding to that the company is breakeven at roughly 40 WTI which makes it one of the most efficient oil producers in the world It also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet The company ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of 07x EBITDA and remains wellprepared in terms of liquidity boasting substantial resources such as revolving bank facilities cash reserves and shortterm investments As of the end of 2Q the companys liquidity stood at an impressive 56 billionAccording to my calculations the company ended the second quarter with 121 billion in net debt Going into 2024 it could reach its target of 10 billion Once the net debt level has reached 10 billion the company sees no need to lower it further as it has pledged to distribute all of its free cash flow to shareholders In this case the company beats most of its peers that have pledged to distribute between 70 and 80 of free cash flow A big part of its distribution consists of dividends The company has a history of 23 consecutive dividend increases which include the Great Financial Crisis the 20152016 oil price slump and the pandemic After a 59 hike in March the current dividend is 090 per share per quarter which translates to a yield of 45 This excludes special dividends Last year the company paid a special dividend of 150 which brought last years total dividend to 460 This would indicate a yield of 57 using the current stock price When adding buybacks the total distribution yield was roughly 12 I expect this rate to remain high based on my bullish oil price thesis and the fact that the companys implied free cash flow yield is high At 85 WTI the company has a free cash flow yield of more than 12Meaning next year the company can distribute 12 of its current market cap if its net debt load falls to 10 billion At 100 WTI that number rises to almost 20 I almost feel like a snake oil salesman but its all based on reasonable assumptions and the companys ability to distribute cash The yeartodate returns to shareholders including dividends totaling 29 billion and share repurchases of 14 billion reached a significant milestone of 43 billion this year Thats 66 of its market cap in the first half of 2023 This also contributes to the companys consistent outperformance Over the past ten years NYlisted CNQ shares have outperformed the energy ETF  by a wide margin The performance even comes close to the SP 500s total return Since 2020 CNQ and XLE have outperformed the market by a wide margin I expect outperformance to continue as Im bullish on oil and believe that we will soon get a rotation from growth to value stocks benefitting undervalued stocks like CNQ It also needs to be said that the pending  TMX is expected to be opened in the next few months which will increasingly allow Canadian producers to capture better prices for their oil and reach more customers The TMX is one of the reasons why I like Canadian oil players in addition to their deep reserves and low breakevens According to Oilpricecom This brings me to the valuation Valuing commoditydriven stocks is tricky as the outlook depends on the price of commodities Looking at the relationship between CNQ and WTI crude oil we see that CNQ has gone sideways while oil has declined There are two reasons for this divergenceBased on the companys free cash flow potential I believe that it is about 50 undervalued if oil prices work their way up to 100 in the next 12 to 24 months On a longerterm basis I expect much higher gains accompanied by aggressive buybacks and juicy special dividends I think weve only scratched the surface when it comes to the companys ability to reward investors If my oil price thesis bears fruit we could be looking at a tremendous total return for many years to comeHowever for now we also need to incorporate recession fears I do not rule out regular corrections which I will be using to boost my position ProsConsI couldnt be more thrilled about my recent investment in Canadian Natural Resources With deep reserves low breakeven prices and a healthy balance sheet CNQ has all the qualities I look for in an energy stock As US shale production loses momentum and energy prices remain elevated CNQ stands out as one of the best oil companies on EarthTheir impressive dividend track record and commitment to distributing excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks make CNQ a great income vehicle that has the potential to outperform its peers and the marketConsidering the projected growth in oil prices and CNQs undervaluation I see tremendous potential for future gains While there might be some bumps along the way Im confident that CNQs ability to reward investors makes it a solid addition to my portfolio for years to comeJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs Preferreds BDCs MLPs ETFs and other income alternatives 438

258,"Kinder Morgan: Higher Leverage, But Lower Profitability Vs. Its Peers",Kinder Morgan  is a wellseparated midstream company with operations in several fields Among all natural gas is the most important element that brings opportunity for the company from the managements point of view That is because natural gasIn my previous  on Kinder Morgan I rated the stock as a buy and after that it rose by approximately 6 In my previous update I investigated KMIs first quarter results and mentioned that according to the higher shortterm demand outlook for natural gas Kinder Morgan has strong opportunities for higher export In this analysis however aligned with the shortterm outlook I investigated the longterm outlook for LNG supply and demand Based on theFigure 1The management noted that although they have several projects in backlog they are sure these projects will be getting done at attractive returns well higher than the capital spent on them Similar to their update on the first quarter of 2023 they have targeted 37 billion in committed growth capital on their backlog projects But the point is what if these projects reach lower returns than what the management expects In that case they may lead to higher leverage for the company and lower distributed cash flow For example KMIs Wabash Valley RNG projects which are part of the Kinetrex acquisition have been more expensive than expectedDuring  Kinder Morgans distributable cash flow declined slightly by 8 and sat at 1076 million versus 1176 million in 2Q 2022 Moreover KMIs dividend yield is in the top 10yield in the SP 500 which is an attractive element of the company Meanwhile the companys net debt amount is at a high level of 317 billion in 2Q 2023 which was almost constant with 316 billion at the end of 2Q 2022 Albeit high net debt levels are almost normal for companies in this industry I believe the management is required to have some plan for deleveraging to reduce its interest expenses With decreasing inflation rates there is no need for highinterest rates in the future However we do not know when the Fed will decide to drop interest rates back to previous levels As the management has no specific plan for deleveraging it seems they have relied on lower interest rates in the near future which I assume is not reliableFigure 2To investigate KMIs financials more accurately I have analyzed its leverage and profitability conditions in comparison with its peers Energy Transfer  and Enterprise Products Partners  In the case of leverage condition Kinder Morgans debttoAsset ratio is 454 which is almost the same as ETs amount of 457 while EPD has performed better and sat at 423 of the debttoasset ratio Additionally KMIs debttoequity level is circa 08x which is slightly lower than ETs debttoEquity of 1x Again PDE has had the lowest level of circa 05x during the last 5 years see Figure 3Figure 3  KIMs leverage condition vs peersMoreover analyzing KMIs return ratios versus the peer group indicates that ET and EPD have used their debt more efficiently As it is indicated in Figure 4 KMIs return on invested capital is 39 which is far lower than ETs and EPDs levels of 74 and 18 respectively This ratio indicates that EPD has been able to turn its capital from investments to profits more successfully Additionally KMI has the lowest return on assets level among its peers Its ROA is 36 which is in line with ETs 39 However well below EPDs ROA of 79 Ultimately KMIs return on equity sat at 8 which is beneath ETs 126 and EPDs 204 All in all considering Kinder Morgans leverage and profitability conditions in comparison to its peers indicate that the management could use debt more efficiently and thus provide more benefits for investorsFigure 4  KMIs return ratios vs its peersFurthermore considering KMIs dividend payment indicates that the company has paid dividends consistently and is growing slowly Their last payment of  which was paid on August 15th was in line with the previous quarter of 0282 per share Also their dividend yield is 643 which is very attractive As a result although Kinder Morgan is not an appropriate choice for growth investors in my point of view the company is strong and reliable for paying back dividends thus a good choice for investors who would like reliable dividend payments albeit with slow growth see Figure 5Figure 5  KMIs dividend payment and yieldKinder Morgan is one of the prominent midstream companies in North America The company has a diversified portfolio of operations like services refinery products and infrastructure Thankfully their potentials and pipeline networks bring the opportunity to soak economic downturns and commodity price fluctuations In this analysis I have investigated shortterm and longterm outlooks for LNG market supply and demand Also I have analyzed KMIs leverage and profitability conditions in comparison with its peers Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners KMI has almost higher leverage ratios vs its peers while it has

259,Lyft: Sub-Scale Discount,Lyft  has made substantial progress toward profitability in recent quarters but it remains a distant second to Uber  This raises questions about Lyfts ability to effectively compete particularly as the market is becoming more dependentLyft generally competes in markets that are dominated by two main players This could result in favorable competitive conditions if a stable equilibrium can be reached but any easing of competition is likely to be tenuous due to the fact that Lyft offers a commodity service in a twosided marketplaceLyfts management team is not currently worried about a price war likely due to a shift in the macro environment The rapid increase in interest rates over theScale is a potential issue for Lyft though given that it is small relative to Uber but this is dependent on a number of complex factors While scale is a potential issue it should be noted that economies of scale for ride sharing are largely local meaning that Lyft is more competitive in the area that matters most than it might appear Lyfts business is more concentrated geographically and is more focused on the ridesharing vertical Ride sharing companies need sufficient scale to create a liquid marketplace but beyond this the balance of supply and demand is more important than scale A denser network of riders and drivers can lead to better routing though improving driver income and reducing pricing for ridersData can also provide economies of scale at the nationalglobal level in areas like insurance costs and advertising Advertisers will be attracted to platforms that can provide them with reach accurate targeting and attribution dataAuto insurance is a problem for ridesharing companies at the moment due to elevated inflation in categories like auto parts and medical costs Lyft has stated that insurance costs per ride  in 2022 and a further 17 in 2023 Data can be used to reduce risk exposure through better routing and network density can reduce the distance driven resulting in lower insurance costs per tripThe balance between riders and drivers improved in the second quarter resulting in the percentage of Lyft rides affected by primetime pricing  and a larger percentage of intended rides converting into actual rides The number of drivers using Lyft increased by over 20 YoY in the second quarter and driver hours increased by more than 35 This strength has carried over into the third quarter with driver numbers up 25 YoY in July and driver hours increasing by nearly 45 YoY The importance of drivers is supported by an  that drivers are currently the limiting factor in growth Lyft appears to be well placed in regard to drivers with the preference for Lyft amongst drivers who use both Lyft and Uber increasing Lyft recently started pricing more competitively which is supporting growth but weighing on margins This change has contributed to strong growth in new and returning riders along with an increase in the number of rides taken by each active rider Intended rides increased  suggesting that strong demand will carry over into the third quarter The conversion of intent into actual rides also continues to improve which is likely closely related to the balance of supply and demandSimilar to Uber Lyft now offers a range of products that aim to maximize the companys revenue and profitability Wait and save is Lyfts most affordable rideshare option allowing riders to pay less if they are not in a hurry While this is a headwind to margins it could help to reduce price shopping between apps Wait and save trips  with volumes far exceeding what Lyfts shared ride business ever achievedLyft also offers a nonemergency healthcare product that provides patients with access to medical treatments and has government support Healthcare rides grew by  in the second quarter and growth should be supported over the long term by aging populationsLyft also offers B2B services which allow an employer to provide transportation for staff Uber has a similar business and has  of these trips are on a premium product which should be supportive of marginsMicro mobility is still a small but growing part of Lyfts business aided by Lyfts acquisition of PBSC in the second quarter of 2022 PBSC has  and 95000 bikes to 45 markets and 15 countries with the acquisition roughly doubling Lyfts micro mobility businessLyft is focused on branding service differentiation and making the app stickier to drive growth and margins Lyfts LTVCAC appears low meaning the company needs to extract more revenue from existing users and reduce the cost of attracting new users Uber is trying to improve its LTVCAC through memberships Uber One members are profitable but margins are lower because Uber is incentivizing members This is offset by the fact that members spend  on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50 greater than nonmember retentionAdvertising should provide Lyft with highmargin incremental revenue going forward as the company recently introduced inapp advertising  on serving display ads introducing video ads by the end of the year This is potentially lucrative as users check the app nearly 9x per ride Lyft is also able to offer advertising across 6500 incar tablets 800 cartop displays and digital screens at its bike share stationsLyfts revenue in the second quarter was  up 3 YoY The increase was driven by strong rideshare ride growth partially offset by lower revenue per ride and a nonrecurring legal expense that was classified as contrarevenue Bike and scooter systems sales growth was also strong in the second quarterLyft expects third quarter revenue to be in the  range a 79 YoY increase This is based on anticipated rideshare ride growth of 20 along with lower revenue per ride due to Lyfts focus on pricing competitively Lyft also suggested on the second quarter earnings call that fourth quarter revenue growth would be in the low to midsingle digit range QoQ which implies that revenue will be fairly flat YoYRideshare rides increased 18 YoY in the second quarter and the number of active riders and drivers each reached multiyear highs The number of active Lyft riders in the second quarter was  an 8 increase YoY Lower pricing negatively impacted revenue per active rider though which was down 5 YoYWhile it is easy to theorize about the impact of network density economies of scale etc gross profit margins provide little evidence of a revenue  COGS benefit Uber and Lyfts gross profit margins are similar and have shown no improvement with scale This is impacted by revenue mix shifts across geographies and verticals though making the impact difficult to assessLyfts  in the second quarter increasing 10 YoY This improvement was only due to a 275 million USD expense associated with Lyfts legacy insurance reserves in Q2 2022 Excluding this impact Lyfts contribution margin declined by 18 due to both lower revenue per ride and higher insurance costs Lyfts contribution margin is expected to be roughly 45 in the third quarter with the improvement driven by healthier driver supply dynamics and less contrarevenueLyfts thirdparty insurance contracts will renew in the fourth quarter resulting in higher costs The company plans on staggering renewals in certain states going forward which it believes will give the company better optionality Lyft is also trying to lower the burden of insurance costs through product and safety initiatives that help reduce accident frequency and improve settlement outcomes This includes things like better routing and greater network densityLyfts operating expenses  in the second quarter as a result of its cost restructuring initiatives Lyft conducted a reorganization in April creating a flatter organizational structure and resulting in more effective communication and decision making While the benefit of recent cost saving initiatives is expected to flow into the third quarter operating expenses will face upward pressure from volume driven costs and an increase in targeted marketing spendWhile Uber and Lyft have both been able to demonstrate significant operating leverage over the past few years it is operating expenses that demonstrate Ubers advantage Lyfts operating expenses are quite low given the companys size but Uber is able to spread its operating expenses across a much larger revenue baseLyfts stock is priced broadly in line with peers based on its current profitability and growth rate The stock trades at a significant discount to Uber though which may be a reflection of the difference in scale between the two companiesLyft remains some way off profitability which is probably a concern for investors even though Lyfts cash balance still provides it with a sizeable runway Increased advertising revenue will be supportive of margins but this will be somewhat offset by rising insurance costs Lyft needs to significantly expand its business to remain competitive which is questionable given current low user growth   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable

260,This Holiday Shopping Season Could Be A Nail-Biter, The holiday selling season represents around 25 of annual retail sales and has always been an important catalyst for investorsWhen it comes to understanding what this holiday season may hold its helpful for investors to consider how the experiences of the past two years might inform retailers expectations especially around supply and demandWe also need to consider how consumers are faring in a much more uncertain macroeconomic environmentBack in 2021 consumer demand was strong coming out of the pandemic but supply chain issues resulted in longer lead times for products to reach stores and inventories were depleted quicklyIn response retailers prepared for 2022 by increasing inventory but demand plummetedFast forward to today we find that while inventory levels are more balanced compared with the excess of 2022 the demand picture remains uncertainInflation has moderated but the outlook for consumers has otherwise weakened Despite recent improvements in real wages many lowincome consumers are still living paycheck to paycheckThe cost of living including food and fuel remains a significant concern and were seeing consumer spending dedicated to needs and food in particular rather than wantsEven higher income consumers are feeling the pinch with increased market volatility a slowing housing market and employment uncertaintyGiven the more challenging spending environment we expect to see variation across the retail landscape this holiday seasonPromotional sales have long been a holiday tradition and this year companies may employ them to boost traffic We dont expect promotions to be excessive but we may see retailers announce sales earlier in the season to help smooth out holiday shopping peaks and troughsIn the end we think that the success of the holiday season and the year is going to come down to the wire for retailers And while they are better positioned in terms of inventory consumers are in no rush and have the upper hand in waiting for dealsFor investors it will be important to identify areas of opportunity notably in athletic wear and beautyRetailers and investors remain defensive in their positioning as it is difficult to identify a catalyst for accelerating demand heading into 2024 The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors ,0,2023-10-25,0

262,AvalonBay: I Will Buy If Strong Growth Persists In Q3,AvalonBay Communities  is a major apartment REIT with properties located in legacy markets on the East and West Coast The REIT focuses on higherend rental units with an average monthly rent of about 2500 andLast time I  the stock was in May when I issued a HOLD rating at 180 per share I liked the way in which AVB was positioned and didnt mind the legacy market exposure but I couldnt see a clear way to 10 returns Since then the stock has been quite volatile reaching as high as 200 only to settle around 180 again More importantly the company has also released very good Q2 2023 results Todays article is meant to update my thesis based on Q2 numbers and to give investors some insights of what to look for in Q3 earnings which will be Ive touched on the topic of new supply in my original article Here I want to provide a little bit more of an insightIts no secret that a large number of people and jobs moved to the South during and after the pandemic This has resulted in a spike in construction activity in the region to about 45 of new supply each year At the same time new supply in the coastal regions has remained relatively stable at 15 per yearOver the past 24 months or so the Sunbelt region has seen unprecedented growth as confirmed by doubledigit FFO increases of MidAmerica Apartment Communities  But now things seem to be slowly changing and legacy markets are starting to catch up This will be clearly illustrated by very high rent growth in AVBs markets but the point is that demand is strong while supply remains at relatively normal levels compared to history certainly the growth in new supply postpandemic has been much lower in Costal markets than in the Sunbelt With strong demand and stable supply I see the risk of oversupply as minimal For this reason I actually slightly prefer the Coastal markets over the Sunbelt at this timeI think that one of the best ways to determine how a REIT is doing is to look at their ability to raise rents which is especially important in a high inflation environment like the one we have todayOver the first six months of the year AVB has done remarkably well on this front by increasing their samestore NOI by 79 YoY Its notable that the increases werent uniform across the portfolio Florida has seen the fastest levels of growth but since this region accounts for less than 3 of the overall NOI it didnt contribute meaningfully to AVBs bottom line The Northeast on the hand has a high weighting and saw very high doubledigit growth of 1012 suggesting that demand is coming back to cities such as NYC or Boston On the other side of the country California and especially Southern California has struggled with low rent increases of only 2 YoYRight now managements full year guidance calls for a 7 YoY increase in NOI When Q3 earnings come out one of the first things Ill want to see will be rent increases across various regions to confirm my thesis that demand is indeed coming back to Coastal markets If management hits their target FFO per share will reach 1050Last year Sunbelt REITs experienced doubledigit rentgrowth but that seems to be thing of the past as MAAs growth guidance for this year is largely in line with AVBsManagement didnt provide any insight on what growth will be like in 2024 and 2025 The general consensus seems to be for 5 same store NOI growth On top of that the REIT will be able to grow by adding new properties to their portfolio Currently there are 3600 units scheduled for completion until the end of next year which if leased will contribute another 45 to growth As a result of these two factors I expect AVB to deliver 68 annual NOI growth until 2025 This is largely in line with the expected growth for AVBs closest peer Equity Residential  and actually above the expected growth for MAA and most other Sunbelt peers which are likely to experience a temporary slowdown in rent growth due to a large spike in new supplyThere are relatively few things that could derail this AVB has an A rated balance sheet with low leverage of only 4x EBITDA and the vast majority 92 of debt fixedrate Moreover near term maturities are low and can easily be repaid from rental revenue if refinancing terms are not favorableWith that said higher interest rates for a long period of time will hurt the stock price in the shortterm as the market rerates to adjust to higher interest rate expectations But whats important is that even with high interest rates cash flow is likely to grow as rent growth will most likely outweigh interest expense increase For this reason I see AVB as quite well positioned for a higher for longer scenario  this would be supported by the fact that it is one of only seven REITs with an A or better ratingThe main risk to my thesis is that the tick up in rent growth in the Northeast will be shortlived and growth rates will decline as soon as Q3 This would negatively impact future growth expectations and therefore the stock price In fact I see Q3 earnings as the breakingpoint which will decide whether Coastal markets are actually coming back strong or not This will to a large extent be determined by rent and NOI growthA share price of 176 today puts the stock at a forward PFFO of 168x which is slightly below where the stock traded last time thanks to increased growth guidance for this year The longterm average for AVB stands around 22x FFO But I dont really expect meaningful multiple expansion until rates come downUntil then investors will continue to receive a 4 dividend yield and are likely to see cash flow increase by 68 per year Thats a slight improvement compared to my last article as a result of very strong rent growth in Q2 I will be watching Q3 results closely and if strong rent growth persists I will initiate a position for now I reiterate my HOLD rating for AVBIf you really like AVB though it might be prudent to initiate a small position before earnings come out because I suspect that if strong NOI growth persists the stock price will move substantially higher on the announcement   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation

263,A Good Time To Be An Energy Bull,In terms of oil market fundamentals things remain relatively bullish at least in the short term Starting with commercial inventories the EIA reported another 22 million barrel draw this past week following a 21 million barrel draw last weekFollowing what has been a few months of persistent inventory drawdowns crude oil supplies in the US are becoming increasingly tightNot only are commercial inventories overall reaching the lows of 2022 prior to the Biden Administration draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but crude oil levels at Cushing Oklahoma have fallen to only 22 million barrels down from a twoyear high of 43 million barrels in JuneSuch stockpiles are worryingly close to minimum operating levels a point which brings into question the quality of remaining stocksWith inventories continuing to track well below their fiveyearWith the inventory picture suggesting excess demand relative to supply other indicators of the physical market also confirm this notion Notably the crude oil futures term structure is currently at its highest level of backwardation in over a yearBackwardation implies there is a supply deficit as market participants are willing to pay a premium for instant delivery despite the associated delivery and storage costs As a result any deficit will need to be met via drawing down inventories Clearly this is exactly what is unfolding at presentNot only is this true of the term structure as a whole but frontend prompt spreads are also suggesting the oil market is tightHowever while backwardation is bullish for prices extreme backwardation and significant spikes in prompt spreads also tend to coincide with shortterm peaks in price something energy bulls should be aware ofThe fact that crack spreads have diverged lower throughout September despite higher prices is one physical market indicator suggesting a correction in the oil price could be on the cards particularly as we are entering refinery maintenance seasonCrack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined productsOne of the big drivers of this recent rally has been the significant level of speculative buying we have seen from hedge funds and CTAsAfter being caught bearish to the highest degree in nearly a decade earlier this year managed money positioning in the futures market has quickly gone from extreme bearishness to extreme bullishnessIf we measure managed money positioning as a percentage of longs relative to total managed money we can see hedge funds and CTAs are now equally as long oil as they have been in yearsSimilar spikes have at the very least coincided with shortterm pullbacks in price Given how swift this rally in oil prices has been I suspect we are due for some kind of pullback if only minorWhile a shortterm correction may be due the mediumterm outlook remains bullish Indeed not only do the realtime indicators of supply and demand remain favourable but forecasts for the remainder of 2023 suggest this deficit is set to continueNotably the EIA  who are notorious for underestimating demand  continue to see a deficit through Q4 of this yearA view eschewed by Morgan StanleyMeanwhile oil analysts at Standard Chartered continue to call for a 13 mbd deficit through Q4 and expect inventory draws to continue into 2024Although such forecasts are inherently difficult and errorprone it seems we are likely to continue to see a supply and demand imbalance toward the bullish side of the spectrum as we close out 2023 an environment that should help put a floor under the oil priceFrom a price action perspective the daily chart for crude continues to trade bullishly The downtrend that encompassed the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023 is clearly behind us with the major moving averages now turning up and the important 8285 resistance level well and truly brokenHowever as I have stated it seems we are probably due for some sort of technical correction if only brieflyIndeed WTI recently triggered a 9139 DeMark sequential sell signal and is now butting heads with the 92 resistance levelThus if I were a betting man I would wager the next 510 is to the downside with any move back toward the mid to low 80s seemingly an excellent buying opportunityOn the whole I continue to remain cautiously bullish on oil prices and energy stocks for the remainder of 2023 The realtime fundamental indicators such as inventories and term structure remain supportive while the technical momentum and trend picture is now firmly on the bullish sideThe level of speculative buying and falling crack spreads do suggest we are probably in need of some kind of shortterm shakeout an outcome that would go a long way to setting up another leg higher as we close out 2023However having said that as I  in my previous oil market update there remain several factors in play that are likely to put a ceiling on oil pricesIndeed much of the current supply deficit is a result of the ongoing Saudi production cuts and Russian export cuts OPEC spare capacity is now the highest it has been since 2010 exCOVID lockdowns and it seems they are once again becoming the primary swing producer of oilMeanwhile Chinese stockpiles have also been filled to the brim so should WTI or Brent prices spike into triple digits I suspect the Saudis would be happy to ramp up production with China also likely to release some of their commercial and strategic stockpiles onto the marketFor these reasons dont expect a spike to 150 oil just yet That will happen but I suspect it will be a story for 2025 once the US election has come and goneThough a blowoff top is not impossible it remains unlikely For now enjoy the favourable fundamentals as we close out 2023 The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,12,2023-09-28,0

267,Plug Power: Profitability By 2025 Is Unlikely,Despite its potential hydrogen is currently not competitive due to its high cost and lower efficiency Plug Powers  profitability projections profitable in 2025 appear overly optimistic given the companys increasing expenses relative to its revenues In addition share dilution and highThe total addressable market has immense potential as a possible storage option for excess electricity Furthermore it could include various transportation methods However predicting the future remains difficult Factors such as production costs competition from electric cars future costs of batteries as potential competition for energy storage future oil prices andWhat seems to be clear however is that hydrogen has not yet established itself on the free market After all we still drive fly and heat with oil today and not with hydrogen Global demand has increased in the last decades but it remains more of a niche product At the moment many things are being politically pushed and subsidized but in the long run this will not be able to cancel out the free marketIn the CO2neutral future scenarios it is assumed that hydrogen will be produced from surplus energy from renewable energy sources But so far this production method is by far the least profitable compared to hydrogen production from gas or coalThe way hydrogen can be used reminds me overall of oil and gas Ultimately it is also just a medium to release stored energy The problem is that so far the hydrogen process is costly and not competitive And if you use gas coal or oil to produce hydrogen the entire process becomes pointless Because then we could burn these energy sources directly which would be even more efficient since with each energy conversion a lot of energy gets lost Plug Power however bases its own story on the assumption that this future scenario of renewable energy to hydrogen will occur on a large scale and that the company will play a significant role in itThis may happen I dont want to exclude that at all With the previous paragraphs I just wanted to say that there are still many question marks and so far few actual hard facts that hydrogen will become established on a large scale There are a lot of political plans but ultimately the free market with supply and demand will prevailFirst a short overview over a more extended period for revenues expenses and net incomeI have created this overview of the income statement of the last quarter compared to the previous year showing where money is spent and how the revenue and cost development is in generalOverall we can see that the trend is continuing that expenses are increasing faster than sales and thus the net income is becoming increasingly negative The current margins are terrible It is all the more astonishing that analysts expect the company to make a profit as early as 2025I think this is highly unrealistic and history does not support it either as you can see from the fact that the earnings revisions look like thisThe company is currently valued at an enterprise value of 64B The market cap is 72B and the company has about 16B in cash Given the current losses of about 200M per quarter these reserves would be depleted after another two years This does not include issuing new shares which will probably happen see below It is also possible that the cash burn will slow down as sales increase but as shown above this is not the case so farOtherwise a valuation of the stock is difficult Surely its not a revelation to alert readers to the expensive pricesales ratioUltimately it is also somewhat subjective whether one considers the current valuation to be justified Because if one believes that hydrogen has a glorious future ahead of it and Plug Power is a company that is operating in the entire hydrogen ecosystem and will multiply its sales in the coming decades the share would be justifiably expensiveBut this glorious future is uncertain even the opposite could be true At the moment hydrogen is being pushed by politics and subsidies and if these are removed one day and the hydrogen industry has to stand on its own two feet it is not sure whether it will surviveAlso not mentioned yet in this article is competition If hydrogen becomes a global cash cow more and more companies will want to enter the market which sometimes results in a price war and lower marginsAnother risk for the adaptation of hydrogen is that this happens globally in different ways The danger is that countries that increasingly rely on hydrogen as an energy carrier may have structural disadvantages compared to other countries that stick to oil and gas If this were to happen companies would relocate their production locations Ultimately hydrogen can only become established longterm if it gets cheaperFor me these three things are standard checks I make in every article as excessive stock dilution and stockbased compensation can put us shareholders at a disadvantage In addition insider trades sometimes contain valuable info about the confidence of management itself Massive selling has occurred in 2021 but none within the last six months Otherwise we can see that the number of outstanding shares has risen massively and continues to rise slowly Also the SBCs are huge and currently account for more than 10 of this years revenueFor my taste not only Plug Power but the entire hydrogen industry still has far too many question marks to be considered as an investment If at all then as a tiny position but Ill stay out of it for now and watch further development High valuations mean high falling heights and there could be several reasons for this disappointing financial figures permanently little global adaptation or waning political support for

268,REIT Meltdown: 3 Rarely Discounted Buying Opportunities,Is there a more reviled and shunned sector of the stock market today than real estateSince the beginning of 2022 publicly traded real estate investment trusts REITs have been one of the worst if not  worst performingIn sharp contrast to soaring energy stocks  real estate stocks  have suffered a decline of nearly 30 since early 2022WhyIn  I talked about the three ways that rising interest rates typically cause REITs to dropThat last point is a major one I hear from commenters again and again WhyOf course the 5 yields on cash offer no upside growth or inflation protection But in any case this is a big reason why investors have shunned REITsAnd then theres one last reason why REITs have performed so badlyIt is true that real estate still faces continued struggles for years to come as hybrid work takes its toll on leasing demand capital spending requirements ramp up in order to retain or attract tenants and lowinterest loans mature and need to be refinanced at much higher ratesFor example in the next three years a steady slate of mortgage loans will continue to mature for midquality Class B office properties which will put tremendous pressure on landlords and undoubtedly create ample pockets of distressI would not want to be a Class B office landlord in Houston for example because of its unappealing combination of 25 vacancy rate and 25 of square footage with loan maturities in the next three yearsSurely this will inhibit the growth of most office real estate going forward as the competition for tenants heats upAgain though office REITs make up a  sliver of the overall REIT universePerhaps some investors assume that other property sectors are suffering similar problems as office but that assumption is incorrectAccording to  both FFO and NOI for the overall REIT index hit new alltime highs in Q2 2023Moreover as I explained in  high interest rates are not  bad for REITsThat is because the higher cost of capital is causing construction starts of new properties to absolutely  across all real estate sectors Hence you see headlines like this one from Yes REITs are hurt by high interest rates But they are not hurt  as bad as the many bankdependent highly leveraged private real estate owners out thereAnd now with REIT prices down 30 from their early 2022 highs publicly traded real estate stocks look like a phenomenal value especially for certain heavily punished yet highquality REITsIll pitch three of my favorite discounted yet highquality REITs below But first let me demonstrate real estates ability to powerfully rebound from selloffs like the current oneAcross the last 7 recessions REITs have been the worst performers averaging a 22 drawdown during these periods Although we have not been in an officially declared recession consider that the almost 30 drawdown since the beginning of 2022 is worse than this averageBut then notice that real estate has been the 1 strongest performing sector during recoveries Moreover it is among the strongest performing sectors during expansionary periodsIt is only during slowdowns and recessions that REITs underperform And when it does underperform the underperformance is typically  than what weve experienced during the current REIT bear marketAs such if and when a recession is finally declared and interest rates come down from current levels REITs should be among the strongest performing sectors if not  strongest performing going into the next recovery phaseLet me demonstrate the power of this from the Great Financial CrisisDuring the GFC the REIT index got obliterated losing nearly 23rds of its value from the Summer of 08 to the trough in March 2009 compared to only 46 for the SP 500  and this is extremely important those who bought REITs anywhere near their bottom in early 2009 were richly rewarded in the years after as the REIT index outperformed the broader market  not considering REITs higher dividend yields until 2018On a total return basis including dividends REITs outperformed the market from their GFC trough all the way up to the beginning of COVID19The current selloff creates a very compelling opportunity for the longterm investorInterest rates dont need to go all the way back to zero for REITs to outperform They just need to stabilize at a more modest level in order to better align costs of capital with property cap rates That will be a massive boon to REITsLets look at three of my favorite highquality picks that I view as coiled springs ready to outperform in the years ahead while generating strong dividend growthIf youve read my articles before youve probably heard me pitch ARE multiple times The Buy thesis remains the same so Ill keep it brief hereARE owns Class A stateoftheart life science  biotech laboratory properties located in the nations most innovative and productive research clusters and leased to the worlds most innovative and productive biotech companiesARE has zero balance sheet stress Its credit ratings are BBBBaa1 It has over 6 billion in liquidity Slightly over 99 of debt is fixedrate And the weighted average debt maturity sits at 132 years among the highest in the REIT space with no maturities until 2025The real concern is the amount of life science supply coming to market Labspace is different than traditional office and its demand outlook is vastly superior But there are lots of traditional office owners redeveloping their empty buildings into new labsThe market is worried that this will spell the end of AREs impressive record of doubledigit rent growthIm not so sureFor one thing the life science development pipeline is slowing down amid a drop in leasing activity This should eventually diminish the oversupply worriesAnother perhaps more important point is that AREs property location and quality acts as a moat in itself The best biotech tenants want to be located in the best life science buildings especially those that are situated in highly productive research clusters  multibuilding campuses where biotech researchers congregateCase in point ARE expects to grow FFO per share by 64 only a little shy of its 10year average growth rate of 74Looking at price to operating cash flow a proxy for FFO we find that ARE has not been this cheap since the wake of the GFCBetween a 43 dividend yield and 6 average annual dividend growth rate ARE looks like a phenomenal Buy for longterm dividend growth investorsCCI owns perhaps the largest telecommunications infrastructure portfolio in the United States consisting of about 40000 towers 120000 small cell nodes and over 80000 route miles of fiber cablesThe telecom infrastructure REIT has taken a huge hit to investor sentiment from cancellations of tower leases used by Sprint due to the merger of Sprint and TMobile The market seems to fear that CCI will never be able to revive growth But management insists that it will be able to return to 5 organic revenue growth and 78 dividend growth after the bulk of the Sprint lease cancellations take effect in 2025 In fact around 75 of this 5 revenue growth is already contracted through 2027As I wrote in CCIs scale cost of capital and leading market position in small cells together act as major competitive advantages that should serve it well in the long runBeing priced at 133x AFFO I think CCI has about 6070 upside to a post2025 fair value AFFO multiple of about 22x Thats on top of its 6 yielding dividendBy pricetoAFFO and price to operating cash flow as pictured above CCI has  during its lifetime as a REITAfter its merger with Life Storage LSI EXR has become the largest owner and operator of selfstorage propertiesI like storage REITs because they have a strong history of outperformance as Americans have accumulated more stuff than theyve been able to fit in the amount of housing they can afford and therefore theyve increasingly relied on storage unitsIn my estimation EXR boasts bestinclass management 19year average tenure for the executive team cost of capital BBB credit rating portfolio quality in top markets and operational excellence This operational advantage includes a toptier technology package which is one of the primary ways management expects the newly added LSI properties to outperform in the coming years as they are added to the systemThere is perhaps no better way to exhibit EXRs quality than by looking at its massive longterm outperformance in total returns over its primary peer Public Storage  as well as the broader REIT index and the SP 500As for ARE there is a lot of recent new supply of storage properties in many markets which is expected to blunt rent growth for at least the next year But also like for other property sectors construction starts for new storage properties has plunged which means that supply and demand should eventually come back into equilibrium and allow for organic growth to resumeEXR now yields 51 far above its 5year average of 34 and the REIT has an extremely impressive history of dividend growthAnd with an 80 payout ratio that dividend looks wellprotected and able to continue EXRs 13year dividend growth streakI wouldnt expect anything more than a measly raise next year but a topquality REIT like EXR is likely to return to strong growth within a few yearsBy price to operating cash flow EXR has not been this cheap since the wake of the GFC in 2011And at an AFFO multiple of 162x EXR has about 35 upside to its 5year average pricetoAFFO of 22x I think shareholders will enjoy that upside and perhaps more within a few yearsThis is an exciting time to be a longterm REIT investor The discounts offered for highquality names across various sectors are ridiculous But Im not complaining Im buyingI believe buyers of bluechip REITs will be richly rewarded for their bravery  eventuallyIf you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks feel free to join us for a  at

quarter came in as expected increasing 3 over the second quarter Our product business grew just over 5 as some WFE fundamental dynamics began to show small signs of improvementWe believe that some progress has been made for equipment inventory reduction throughout the system and expect several more quarters until normal levels are achievedWeOur typically highmargin service business saw an abrupt decline in revenue due toFor the foreseeable future we will continue to focus on optimizing our global footprint driving operational efficiencies and other strategic initiatives to further increase our value for our customers These efforts will lay the foundation required to capitalize on share gain opportunities heading into the next rampWe are in a strong position to increase our semi manufacturing leadership position with the available capacity and geographic flexibility to meet accelerated demand when it returnsAlong those lines we are very pleased to report that we have acquired HIS Innovations Group They provide design manufacturing integration of components process solutions and fully integrated subsystems to the semiconductor subfab segmentThis acquisition adds a higher gross margin and value product offering increases our vertical capabilities and synergies extends our reach into the subfab area and expands our addressable market by approximately 15 billionWith over 60 fabs under construction globally this acquisition aligns with our longterm strategy to pursue sustained and profitable growth and will be rolled into our product divisionLastly we are deeply saddened and concerned by the current events in the Middle East We are taking the situation very seriously and Im relieved to say that all our employees are accounted for and were doing all we can to assist with their safety and wellbeingBoth of our facilities in Israel are running at the capacity required to meet production targets Our commitment to support our customers worldwide remains a

navigating through the demand variability in the current environment Longer term our increased scale operational efficiencies expanded capacity and new capabilities position us well to maintain our leadership position and outperform the industryAnd with that I will turn the call over to SheriThanks Jim and good afternoon everyone Thanks for joining us In todays discussion I will be referring to nonGAAP numbers only As Jim noted our products business performed well from a revenue standpoint in the third quarter Our services business however was impacted by a sudden largerthanexpected reduction in wafer starts in Q3 and that impacted our overall profitability and earningsTotal revenue for the third quarter was 435 million compared to 4215 million in the prior quarter Revenue from products increased 51 to 3809 million compared to 3625 million last quarter Services revenue was 541 million compared to 59 million in Q2 due to the scale back and wafer starts as I just mentionedTotal gross margin for the third quarter was 155 compared to 167 last quarter Although product revenue grew sequentially gross margin came in at 138 compared to 145 in the prior quarter and services was 274 compared to 303 in Q2The reduction in margin was due to lower volumes for service and overall mix within each business unit We continue to focus on cost improvements and operational efficiencies to strengthen profitabilityOperating expenses for the quarter was 486 million compared with 494 million in Q2 and decreased as a percentage of revenue to 112 from 117 Total operating margin for the quarter was 44 compared to 5 in the second quarterMargins from our Products division was 45 compared to 43 in the prior quarter and services margin was 37 compared to 93 in the prior quarter The drop in services margin was due to lower volumes and mixBased on 45 million shares outstanding earnings per share for the quarter was 004 on net income of 2 million compared to 016 on net income of 71 million in the prior quarterOur tax rate for the quarter was 373 due to a shift in profits by geography Our tax rate was trued up in Q3 for yeartodate expense and we expect our tax rate for Q4 and 2023 to be approximately 20Turning to the balance sheet our cash and cash equivalents were 342 million an increase of 212 million over Q2 Cash from operations was 362 million similar to last quarter at 364 millionAs we navigate through the current cycle we will continue to manage our working capital Given macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and current industry dynamics we are keeping our guidance range wideWith the addition of HIS Innovations Group we project total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 between 420 million and 470 million We expect EPS in the range of 002 to 022 This includes approximately 10 million of revenue and 001 of EPS for two months of operations from the acquisitionAnd with that Id like to turn the call over to the operator for questionsWe will now begin the questionandanswer session Operator InstructionsThe first question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen Please go aheadHi This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Krish Lets see first just in terms of the service sales this quarter I know theyre a bit weaker on utilization rates last quarter and you mentioned the sudden reduction of wafer starts impacting in SeptemberWas there  the main qualifier for this quarter Or was there anything else in maybe just in terms of the mix that goes into the service division if youve ever broken that downYes hi Robert The first part we have seen reductions in wafer starts across the broad spectrum of fabs prior to this last quarter What we saw early in the third quarter was one particular chipmaker ratchet down mostly their memory fab pretty dramatically Theyve been holding that up for half the time when others had already brought their utilizations down So that was  I guess youd say the last month will really fall So that was the main impact thereAs far as your second question around the mix I think maybe my answer on the first might answer that But service is typically more dependent on logic than memory but this is a rather large memory fab and had an outsized impactGreat Thank you And then maybe just real quick in terms of the timing of seeing the ramp down of that one customer is there any indication of maybe when the sales would pick back up Is that something you think services would be growing next quarter or something more into calendar year 2024 ThanksYes really difficult to predict Were starting to see some of the fundamentals of supply and demand of these chips start to move towards a better balance We start to see some ASP on some of these chips start to recover a bitSo things are moving in the right direction but as far as when the customers will start ramping up the supply side of the chips and use their utilization is up its still unclear But I would say its doubtful to see anything meaningful within this yearGreat Thank you Thats helpfulOperator Instructions At this time were showing no more questions This concludes our questionandanswer session I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Scholhamer for any closing remarksThank you all for joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarterThe conference has now concluded Thank you for attending todays presentation You may now disconnect,0,2023-10-25,0

271,Ladder Capital: The Perfect Storm,A few days ago I wrote a  highlighting a few of my favorite commercial mREITsAs I consistently remind readers I like owning commercial mREITs because I get the best of bothNow to be clear price appreciation is not guaranteedAnd neither are high dividendsAnd thats why I maintain a healthy mix of mREITs and preferredsIve been adding more of both to my REIT portfolio that now looks something like thisI like this blueprint because it provides me with enhanced yield preferreds and mREITs as well as attractive total return attributesI was fortunate to get greedy during COVID19 and increase my exposure within the commercial mREIT sectorOf course these returns were generated during unprecedented times andAs you can see above  was one of my top COVID picks which means that our team had to dig deep into the business model in order to gain confidence in our Strong Buy recommendationAs you can see LADR is now trading at 1058 per share and shares have returned 123 year to dateLets dig deeper into this interesting commercial mREIT so you can see firsthand why Im buying more shares hand over fistIn case youre not familiar with mREITs a few excerpts from our overviewWithin the commercial mREIT sector you can break down the REITs into two categories They originate or purchase loans for their own balance sheet and hold these on their balance sheet Examples include Blackstone Mortgage  and Apollo Commercial  They originate andor purchase loans for their own account balance sheet or to be sold into a securitized vehicle such as CMBS conduit Examples include Starwood Property  and Ladder CapitalWhile senior secured lending is Ladders core business the REIT is diversified as shown belowAs you can see more than 50 of LADRs assets are unencumbered and 84 of these unencumbered assets are comprised of first mortgage loans investmentgrade securities and cash and cash equivalentsLADR maintains a considerable surplus of unencumbered assets over the amount required by its covenants currently totaling over 1 billion This cushion provides the company with a great deal of flexibility and enhances its liquidity profileThe balance sheet portfolio totals 35 billion with a weighted average coupon of 915Breaking down the loan portfolio LADR focuses on middle market borrowers with an average loan size of 25 million largest loan in the portfolio is 221 million Compare that with these peersThis means that LADR takes a nimbler approach and is less exposed to large loans that could result in concentration risks Since inception in 2008 Ladder has originated 45 billion of loans in more than 475 cities across 48 statesAs you can see Ladder is not a construction lender and has modest funding of just 272 million as of Q223 Importantly the companys loan portfolio is 99 senior secured first mortgage loans with an average LTV loan to value of 67 Compare that with these peersAs you can see above LADRs loan portfolio is comprised ofWhile LADR is exposed to the office sector 75 of these loans were originated postCOVIDIn addition two of the office loans Miami and Aventura account for 36 of the office exposure These two larger loans 221 million and 110 million have 30 borrower equity around 138 million in total with excellent performanceLADR did add a new loan to nonaccrual in Q223 a 35 million loan on a mixeduse asset in which LADR is pursuing foreclosure The borrowers basis is 55 million which is comprised of 174 newly constructed multifamily units and three floors of office and commercial space in PittsburghAs mentioned previously LADR owns around 900 million of brick and mortar real estate that consists of net lease properties 72 of real estate owned and others 28The net lease portfolio consists of 156 properties leased to highquality tenants 69 investment grade like BJs Walgreens and Dollar General The portfolios gross asset value is around 663 million with a weighted average remaining lease term of nine yearsThe net lease portfolio generates 417 million of NOI and the other properties generate around 188 million annuallyLADRs CMBS business is mostly confined to fiveyear loans the carrying value of the securities portfolio is around 458 million comprised of 82 AAArated and 99 investmentgrade rated securitiesIn Q2 LADR received 75 million of paydowns In Q2 LADR began to take advantage of opportunities to add to its securities portfolio by acquiring additional AAA CLO securities that are currently offering highly attractive returnsAs of Q223 LADR had 11 billion of liquidity with a leverage ratio of 17x This liquidity was comprised of 777 million plus undrawn revolver capacity of 324 million with a maturity in 2027Unsecured bonds anchor the capital stack with 16 billion outstanding or 40 of debt with a weighted maturity of 43 years with an attractive fixed rate cost of capital of 47 average couponLADR has a strong financial condition with a corporate credit rating one notch from investment grade two of three rating agencies LADR has a 50 million share buyback authorization in place with 44 million of remaining capacity no purchases in Q223One key differentiator for LADR is its modest total leverage with a highly durable composition of financing alternativesLADR emphasizes on unsecured and nonrecourse nonmarktomarket financing with a substantial unencumbered asset base as shown below84 of unencumbered assets are cash first mortgage loans or investment grade securitiesAnother differentiator for LADR is managementThe company is one of the few internally managed mREITs in which management and directors own 10 of the company 150 million equity investment Also employees are compensated based on profits and with a significant portion in stockThe executive management team averages 27 years of industry experience and the majority of the management team has worked together for 25 yearsAs seen below this deep bench of seasoned professionals  managers average 11 years at Ladder and 23 years of industry experienceAs seen below LADR trades at 1058 per share with a PE multiple of 81x  around 50 below the normal PEThe dividend yield is 87 lower than most of the peers that average around 11Like many mREITs LADRs earnings history is choppyUnlike traditional equity REITs mREITs like LADR generate revenue from loans which makes the earnings stream less predictableAs you can see below the company generated EPS of 203 in 2018 and fell to 49 in 2021 In 2022 the company generated EPS of 116 and analysts forecast 137 in 2023LADR was forced to reduce its dividend in 2020 which resulted in a dividend payout of 80 in 2021Last year LADR paid out 88 per share and currently the company is paying out 23 per share 92 per share annualizedAnalysts are forecasting EPS of 137 in 2023 which means theres a cushion in which the company could payout a special dividend this year which it has in previous yearsUsing the analyst numbers LADRs payout ratio in 2023 is around 67As one analyst pointed out on the Q223 earnings call LADR has significantly overearned it dividend yeartodate which means that theres a good chance that LADR will boost the dividend and perhaps gift a special dividend in DecemberLets compare a few peersNow lets compare LADRs PE with the peersInterestingLADR has the lowest payout ratio and one of the best balance sheets in the sector and yet shares are trading at a discount to the peersNow lets take a look at analyst estimates for 2024 and 2025While LADR may be the lowestpaying mREIT on our shopping list we believe the total return prospects are compelling The dividend is well protected and I like the fact that LADR owns real estate mostly net lease real estateI believe shares are worth more than 1058 and they could fetch as much as 1200Given the fact that commercial banks are slowing down dramatically which faces more pressure on small developers with lingering debt maturities LADR is well positioned to capitalize on new demandSome of the demand will be in the form of traditional senior secured lending and some will be in the form of growing mezzanine loans As CEO Brian Harris said This is a market that is ripe for mezzanine lending obviously in special situationsI like this line of thinkingTraditionally mezz loans are riskier but Harris is looking to provide an AB component which means splitting up the senior secured in a 10year fixed rate instrument and the mezz loan on LADRs booksGiven the fact that LADRs wheelhouse is middle market customers average 25 million loan size this could create a lot of demandOf course LADR has plenty of powder right now  around 900 million  and I suspect the company will begin to put that to good use sooner than laterWe believe LADR could return over 20 annually which aint bad given the fact that the yield is currently 87 with a likely boost coming soonIf I were a regional developer like I once was and I knew my shopping center loan was coming due and my bank would not renew it I would be knocking on LADRs doorRemember folks the game is all about supply and demandAnd managing risk is what separates the best from the restI like my odds with LadderJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREIT Preferreds BDCs MLPs ETFs Builders Asset Managers and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the

272,"Clarus: Promising Initiatives, But Risks Still Present",Shares of Clarus  have fallen 20 YTD Despite the fact that the companys management is quite optimistic about the future performance of the business I believe that it is still not the best time to open aDespite significant pressure on both revenue growth and operating margins management is fairly optimistic for the second half of 2023 but I believe the companys financials will continue to be under pressure in the next quarter while shares are still not cheaply priced In addition the improvement in profitability is largely due to the recovery of gross margin in the Precision Sports segment which in my personal opinion is associated withClarus designs develops and manufactures outdoor equipment and products The main business segments are Outdoor 48 of revenue Precision Sports 31 of revenue and Adventure 21 of revenue The company makes sales both in the domestic market 56 of revenue and in the international market 44 of revenue The company was founded in 1957The company  The companys  Domestic sales were down 272 YoY and international sales were down 271 YoY In terms of business segments the largest contribution to the decline in revenue was made by the Outdoor segment where revenue decreased by 238 YoY while in the Precision Sports and Adventure segments sales decreased by 267 YoY and 342  YoY respectively You can see the details of the revenue mix changes in the graph belowGross profit margin decreased from 380 in Q2 2022 to 367 in Q2 2023 due to unfavourable changes in product mix and unfavourable FX Separately I would like to note the change in gross profit margin for each of the segments Thus we see the greatest decrease in the Precision Sports segment where gross profit margin decreased from 449 to 317 due to the need to reduce prices due to high inventory levels in the industry and in the Outdoor and Adventure segments gross profit margin increased from 331 to 375 and from 385 to 422 respectively SGA expenses  of revenue increased from 308 in Q2 2022 to 361 in Q2 2023Operating margin decreased from 68 in 2Q 2022 to 03 in 2Q 2023 In the graph below I would also like to demonstrate adjusted operating income because in the 4th quarter of 2022 the company faced onetime expenses for impairment of goodwill and indefinitelylived intangible assets in the amount of 923 millionIf we pay attention to the operating margin by business segment we see that profitability continues to decline in all segments Thus operating margin in the Outdoor segment decreased from 28 to 31 and in the Precision Sports and Adventure from 348 to 204 and from 24 to 28 respectivelyIn addition the company published guidance for 2023 Thus management expects that in the second half of the year the company will show a decrease in revenue growth rates in the range from 05 to 73 and the adjusted EBITDA margin will improve to 206228On the one hand I am impressed by the current management initiatives transforming our product development and innovation process improving customer service and digital transformation which are aimed at restoring business revenue growth rates and improving profitabilityHowever on the other hand in my personal opinion the operational and financial performance may take longer to recover so I expect the companys financial performance to continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters First I think pressure on sales in the Outdoor segment 48 of revenue will continue in the second half of 2023 because I do not expect a quick recovery in consumer spending even if we see a slowdown in inflation because consumers will continue to face increased daytoday costs If we look at  following the earnings release we can see that management is talking about similar trendsIn addition the company published strong guidance which implies a recovery in growth rates and profitability however if we look at the guidance in more detail we can see that the main recovery is associated only with the 4th quarter of 2023 while in the next quarter 3Q 23 the pace Sales growth will continue to be under significant pressureI would also like to note that the restoration of profitability is associated with an improvement in gross margin in the Precision Sports segment where the company experienced the largest decline However it is my personal opinion that high inventory levels in the industry consumer pressure from macro headwinds and a decrease in the amount of time people choose to spend outside the home will continue to put pressure on profitability in the segment So I think the current guidance looks optimistic but the financials are still quite uncertainMoreover I think that additional pressure on profitability may be exerted by the deleverage effect due to a decrease in the scale of the business because part of the operating expenses salaries distribution is fixed lower consumer spending high industry inventory levels and a decline in the amount of time people choose to spend outside the home could put pressure on revenue growth rates in the coming quarters investments in prices unfavourable product mix unfavourable changes in FX increased marketing costs and deleverage effects due to reduced economies of scale may have a negative impact on the operating profitability of the business launch of new products simplification of the cooperation model with partners and expansion of the ecommerce platform for B2B and B2C sales may contribute to revenue growth in the future recovery of gross margin in the Precision Sports segment due to the normalization of supply and demand before the hunting season can provide significant support to the operating profitability of the businessValuation Grade is C In accordance with the PE FWD and EVEBITDA FWD multiples the companys shares are trading at 75x and 85x respectively which implies a discount to the sector median of about 47 and 7 respectively Despite the fact that the stock doesnt look expensive I believe investors need to wait for the next quarters financial results before making a purchase decision because 1 I believe the company deserves a discount based on the size of the business 2  shares may trade at relatively low prices for long periods of time in the absence of clear growth driverscatalysts revenue growth improved profitabilityThus at the moment my recommendation is hold I believe that pressure on both revenue growth and profitability may continue in the coming quarters while the shares are still not cheaply priced I will be happy to change my recommendation to buy if I see that the company is able to demonstrate stable and sustainable improvements in financial performance in both domestic and international markets   Past performance is no

273,URNM: Your Stepping Stone To Uranium Mining, is exposed to USlisted uranium miners Here I discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of investing in this space I also discuss the key drivers behind URNM andUranium serves as the crucial fuel for nuclear energy playing a pivotal role in supporting our transition towards a netzero carbon future Nuclear energy possesses a distinct advantage in providing a costeffective dependable flexible and scalable source of baseload powerUnlike renewable sources like wind and solar nuclear power generation does not rely on favorable weather conditions making it highly reliable and available around the clock and during different seasonsFurthermore its scalability ensures that we can meet increasing energy demands without the need for extensiveInvestors who understand the need for uranium but dont want to figure out how to invest in this space may consider investing in an ETF like the Sprott Uranium Miners ETFURNM is a USlisted uranium ETF focused on uranium miners and physical uranium Below youll see its top holding by weightWhat should jump out to you is that this ETF is significantly weighted towards Cameco  with 17 of its total weight That being said it also includes a range of other minersAnd this brings me to another consideration As investors in this space you may be aware that this ETF is not the only ETF offering similar exposure Indeed the Global X Uranium ETF  is for the most part quite similar There are some minor differences such as substantially more concentration for instance Cameco makes up a quarter of the URA ETF rather than less than 20 with URNM but I dont believe thats a real gamechangerI know that this may irk some readers who may point out that URA has more liquidity or an eversoslightly lower expense ratio but I believe this is overthinking the uranium thesisI contend that the uranium thesis is either going to work or its not And thats tied for the most part to uranium pricesAnd if it does one ETF may be slightly less volatile meaning the URNM will probably be slightly less volatile given it is less concentrated at the top but overall they are tied to the same idea which is indirectly the uranium price see belowIf the underlying commodity uranium does well the whole sector will move higherFurthermore readers should also know that the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF is not the only way to seek exposureIn my opinion the drawback of investing in URNM or URA is the cyclical nature of the uranium industry As you know the uranium mining industry is cyclical When uranium prices are high mining companies can thrive but this will bring on excess uranium supply which will dampen uranium pricesThat being said I would counter that notion by asserting that in the next couple of years there appears to be a shortfall between uranium supply and demand estimatesAs you can see above there are close to 200 million pounds of uranium in demand right now with around 150 million in production Meanwhile even now despite more attention towards this sector it remains quite a small space see belowAnd opening a new uranium mine can take many years requiring capital and favorable regulationYes I believe that if one is right on the thesis one may consider investing in a uranium producer such as Uranium Energy Corp  disclosure Im long UEC Investors dont need to only consider UEC indeed there are several other uranium producers in North America that are also worthwhile consideringThe significant advantage of investing in the producers rather than an ETF is that individual producers will benefit from operating leverage However the drawback will be the volatility of the underlying stockInvesting in the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF offers exposure to USlisted uranium miners which is essential given uraniums critical role in supporting the transition to a netzero carbon future through nuclear energyThis energy source boasts costeffectiveness reliability flexibility and scalability providing a stable baseload power supply that isnt dependent on weather conditions unlike renewables like wind and solar URNM although slightly less concentrated compared to other similar ETFs presents an opportunity for investors to tap into this sectorHowever its important to understand that the uranium industry is cyclical with potential fluctuations in uranium prices Yet with a current demandsupply gap uranium producers like Uranium Energy Corp offer a more leveraged investment option albeit with higher volatilityMy Marketplace highlights a portfolio of

274,Argentina Lithium: $90 Million Investment From Stellantis Implies A Substantial Upward Rerate,Argentina Lithium  Energy Corp  has been a trending stock in Canada since the afternoon of September 27th when it  a 90 million USDequivalent investment made by Stellantis NV  StellantisDespite the move up I believe that LIT still has an upside potential of over 100 as a 055 stock price implies a 72 million CAD market cap less than the money being received in the deal Not only does LIT require a substantial upward rerate I believe that this deal is an absolute gamechanger for all junior lithium plays in the regionCanadian junior market traders have witnessed a long history of claims from microcap resource explorers getting deals with larger companies that were either faked or greatly overstated So there was understandably some nervousness or skepticism about this deal Once it closed and documentation on SEDAR the Canadian equivalent to SECgov filed there was no longer any issue about the deal being fake What remains are two other criticisms1 Stellantis overpaid for LIT and could have just bought it out for that level of investment2 Stellantis overpaid for LIT relative to other lithium players in ArgentinaHad Stellantis just offered 90 million in a takeover offer it likely would have succeeded in a buyout attempt based on the stock price prior to the deal being announced However Stellantis isnt interested in making an investment in a lithium company the same way private investors would nor is it interested in operating a mine itself Its interest in LIT is primarily in sourcing and securing a supply of lithium in Argentina so that it has enough of the resources to build its fleet of electric vehicles It is willing to far overpay relative to market cap in order to ensure that LIT has enough cash and financial motivation to build out a mine and ship lithium to the companys front door starting in 2028 Stellantis has the right of first refusal on any future financing needed or sale of lithium to third parties on production beyond the 15000 tonnes outlined in the offtake agreement Further evidence that the companys primary motivation is securing supply and making sure LIT has the cash to get the mine operational regardless of costThe second argument is a more interesting one and could imply a substantial upward rerate for other junior lithium players that have mostly been overlooked while the price of lithium has crashed recently But after speaking with LITs CEO Nikolaos Cacos its clear that Stellantis had direct companyrelated reasons to target LIT The two companies were negotiating the deal for over a year and closed it despite the drop in the price of lithium One prime motivating factor was Joseph Grosso being the Chairman of LIT and the  Grosso has a history of success bringing resource projects to operations in Argentina a very important factor when dealing with the sensitive and volatile nature of the countrys geopolitical and economic climateThe other major motivating factor was location LITs  is Rincon West a 37428 hectaresized land package 4605 hectares wholly owned the rest under option that is adjacent to Rio Tinto Group  Rio  825 million for the 83000 hectares of mining rights from Rincon Mining less than two years ago Stellantis was very interested in securing supply from this specific spot as the lithium arms race in the Argentinian Lithium Triangle heats upHowever Stellantis isnt solely interested in Rincon West although that will likely be the nearterm focus LIT has three projects just south of Rincon West with Antofalla North Pocitos and Incahuasi being approximately 10000 26000 and 25000 hectare projects respectively So Rincon only makes up around 5 of the total land in the Lithium Triangle that is either wholly owned or under option to LIT There is a lot of lithium potential for this company and its all proximal to each other which was likely the clinching factor for Stellantis calling first dibs In this context a 60 billion market cap company overpaying 90 million for a 20 stake in a company that has secured about 65000 hectares within the Triangle makes senseThe companys  shows that Rincon has an active drill program underway with drilling planned in Antofalla North in 2024 These projects are all in the early to very early stages and will take years before fully operational mines are present but this is no issue for Stellantis as its looking to secure resource for planned production five years from now The single biggest obstacle to roadmaps being achieved in the junior capital world is a companys ability to fund all of its plans With that obstacle removed for LIT and a large partner interested in seeing things move along as quickly as possible I expect these timelines to be met or possibly even exceeded Subject to timing of government permits and availability of equipment and labor in the regionIf we are thinking from the perspective of a large automaker trying to secure supply within a competitive Lithium Triangle Stellantis didnt overpay it paid the amount it needed to pay to accomplish a needed goal for future development plans I liken this to an NFL football team that is desperate to secure a quarterback in the draft with the 5th overall pick The teams drafting ahead of them already picked quarterbacks Now this team has to draft what it feels is the next best one available with the 5th pick even if that QB is rated the 10th or 15th or 20th or 25th best prospect overall by all the socalled experts The team will have tryouts and interviews with the QBs leading up to the draft and then analyze which one still available best fits their organizationIt doesnt matter what other people think of LITs land package or accomplishments relative to other junior explorers in the region They arent the multibillion dollar vehicle manufacturer ponying up 90 million betting on LITs future ability to perform It only matters what Stellantis thinks The rest of the investment community must make its own buy and sell decisions knowing that Stellantis is highly motivated and capable to ensure LIT succeedsAs one member of that investment community I have to assess what I believe to be a fair value for LIT based on the information I have as well as the caveats and potential roadblocks that must be overcome to get to that valuation in a timely fashionAs with every explorer LIT is prerevenue It has about 2 million in expenses a quarter and this burn rate will substantially increase going forward as it attempts to accomplish the plans laid out in the roadmap for its four properties Given the substantial investment by Stellantis I believe that financing risk is completely taken off the table as long as Stellantis remains a solvent entity Any unexpected cost overruns or delays to expected production in 2028 might result in dilution but wont result in insolvency I expect the cash runway from the investment to be a minimum of three years and if that cash is spent wisely any further financing will happen at a superior valuation than todayArgentina has historically been reasonably friendly to mining and I dont expect that to change given the economic opportunity that lithium will provide the country Being a member of the Grosso Group and getting the deal with Stellantis are two pieces of assurance that the company will be able to navigate at least one project through to production by 2028Stellantis is paying 90 million for an option to hold a 199 stake in the public listing fully diluted If Stellantis exercises this option it would receive 53 million shares out of a then total 266 million essentially paying approximately 170 USD or 230 CAD for the shares The simplistic analysis would be that if Stellantis is willing to pay that much investors should be able to feel comfortable holding until at least that price range But it may not be that simpleThe first issue to overcome is that this deal is in Argentinian Pesos Due to the countrys high inflation rate the currency has been on a consistent downward trajectory Therefore LIT is looking to transfer most of that cash into USD and CAD with some expected slippage in the 10 range I expect the net result to be 80 million USD or 110 million in CADThere are currently 1302 million shares outstanding along with 717 million warrants with a weighted average strike of 044 and 113 million stock options with a weighted average strike of 031 In the week between announcing the deal and closing the deal SEDAR documentation shows that 150000 warrants were exercised for shares This share overhang may have accounted for the pullback in the stock price and may continue to apply some selling pressure going forward Upon exercise of all of those derivatives the share count would increase to 213 million but would also lead to an additional 35 million in cashBetween the 110 million CADequivalent received from the Stellantis deal and 35 million from the exercise of derivatives total cash in the bank would be 145 million 068 per share This is a reasonable floor valuation for LIT The cash from Stellantis is earmarked for exploration and mine development costs or the purchase of additional properties in Argentina with some corporate expenses allowed It cant be used for purposes like buying back stock or paying dividends However I dont see how cash received from the exercising of warrants would have that same restriction It might seem silly to use cash received from the exercise of warrants to buy back shares but in this circumstance it makes sense to do so should the stock remain below the 068 level for an extended period of time That may be one way to offset any overhang from the warrants being exercisedThe component of the deal that will provide LIT investors with the highest longterm value is the offtake agreement It calls for up to 15000 tonnes per annum of lithium produced over a sevenyear period However with the way the offtake agreement is worded I interpret it as Stellantis being at LITs allyoucaneat lithium restaurant and other customers only being allowed in once Stellantis has had its fill For the purpose of my analysis I will assume 15000 tonnes shipped starting in 2028 The price paid by Stellantis will be market pricing based on the prior calendar quarters price of the relevant subtype of lithium as quoted by Fastmarkets with a small freight discountViolent swings in the price of lithium will likely continue making price predictions for 2028 difficult Though the bearish movement seen in 2023 is very unlikely to be the same market sentiment five years from now unless a new battery technology comes along that puts a significant damper on the demand for Liion batteries Pricing is much more likely to be above 50000 per tonne than 20000 per tonne but I will take a reasonably conservative middleground price of 30000 per tonneFrom there its a matter of simple math 15000 tonnes at 30000 per tonne is 450 million in revenue Assuming a 35 margin thats 158 million in gross margin Take off another 30 million or so for SGA and 25 for taxes and LIT is left with approximately 100 million per year in net income Apply a 10x multiple and we are looking at a billion dollar company Now its time to look at the obstacles to be overcome in order to get to that levelAs I mentioned before this deal takes financing risk off of the table Any additional funds needed for construction will be found However that will come at the cost of dilution While Stellantis wouldnt have signed this deal without having a strong inkling that LIT will have the resource ready for shipment starting in 2028 until we have feasibility studies available on the properties this remains a big if for the investment community As seen in the roadmap above LIT is still at the starting stages of drillingBased on the vague nature of the economics and timing of lithium operations  the same level of vagueness any earlystage explorer would have  I require a discount rate of 75 That would take the billion dollar valuation down to 250 million My analysis assumes LITs full ownership of the operating subsidiary and that Stellantis exercised its option to convert into shares leading to a total of 266 million outstanding All cash would be used in mine development so nothing would be available to buy back shares or could be added to the enterprise value to pad the valuation This leads to a 094 US per share target or approximately 130 for LITs Canadian listingThe steep 75 discount is a byproduct of a 45 year wait before LIT generates revenue a lithium price which has been volatile and will continue to be volatile towards 2028 though I expect more upside than downside and the fact that we have no economic reports out to assess construction costs cost to mine grade or total resource estimate yet If any of these variables were to be substantially below mine and Stellantis expectations it would hurt the 130 price target Conversely if these issues met or exceeded expectations the stock should head towards this target But because of the strong cash balance today I believe the floor on LIT is high enough that there is an asymmetrical rewardtorisk outcome even in a less than favorable performance scenarioI have three ways to evaluate a fair price target on LIT First the CAD cash per share estimate assuming all derivatives are exercised leads to 068 That could be seen as a minimum target for shortterm holders who arent really that interested in the lithium story but want to take advantage of the opportunity provided by Stellantis aggressive cashheavy investment The second method would be to use Stellantis valuation based on paying 90 million US for a 199 stake leading to a valuation of over 600 million CAD or 230 per share The third would be to take my backofthenapkin math on the offtake agreement to come to 130 per share then reassess the position should the stock price hit that level but company accomplishments might require an improved discount rate No matter what method I use at 055 LIT is ambiguously a buy and holdGoing back to my NFL Draft analogy lets say Team Stellantis decided to draft the QB that was deemed the 15th best pick by the pundits Now only the 10th 20th and 25th bestrated players are available at the QB position The options for QB for the rest of the teams just dropped from four to three and it also doesnt preclude Team Stellantis from drafting another quarterback because they plan to do A LOT of passing in the next few years Okay so the analogy isnt perfect but it gets the point across Stellantis just made an aggressive move to take one junior explorer from the Lithium Triangle essentially for itself but that doesnt mean that its done Buyout offers for  and  have also taken place in 2023 further limiting cheap junior options to securing lithium supplyThis MA activity makes the remaining explorers inherently more valuable and the companies looking for lithium supply more desperate We should be seeing a substantial upward rerate across the board in Argentina but the price action since LITs deal first came to light hasnt indicated as such so farOne such floundering company is Lithium South Development Corporation  which sits just about at its 52week low It sits around a 40 million CAD market cap a little more than half where LIT is now without a 90 million deal There may be a good reason for that as LIS is further along with its drilling and resource estimateLithium Souths flagship project is  which sits right in between LITs Rincon West and Antofella projects There are a number of larger players in the region namely POSCO Holdings Inc  which is directly adjacent to LIS 5687 hectare projectLIS  a preliminary economic assessment in the past and has recently  its lithium resource estimate by 175 after further drilling in 2022 and 2023 It now has 1583100 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent with 1462900 of that being measured If there was another company looking for 15000 tonnes of LCE per year it appears that LIS would be able to provide that for the next 100 yearsLIS is a company I own and therefore have more familiarity but there are numerous publicly traded companies with earlystage projects in the Lithium Triangle such as Argosy Minerals Limited  Lithium Energi Exploration Inc  and NOA Lithium Brines Inc  Companies with holdings primarily in Chile but within or close to the Triangle also cant be overlooked such as Lithium Chile Inc  or First Lithium Minerals Corp FLMCA I encourage investors who are interested in the region to do some research into those namesJunior lithium companies have been pounded into the ground due to the general bearish market in the smallcap space and with the diving price of lithium in particular What LITs deal with Stellantis shows along with other MA activity in the region is that high interest rates inflation and general geopolitical instability is not going to stop the supply and demand imbalance of the lithium industry The electric vehicle manufacturers will determine the viability of this industry not the general macro climate nor Wall Street pundits If a deal like this between LIT and Stellantis can be made in the fall of 2023 imagine what the value of lithium companies in Argentina will be when bullish supercycles become the buzzwords of day again   Editors Note

275,"D.R. Horton: Likely To Outperform, Despite The Cyclical Housing Market",DR Horton  is a stock that requires no introduction as the largest homebuilder by volume in the US since 2002With a welldiversified home portfolio rangingDHIs performance over the past few quarters exceeded expectations indeed with growing home sales and backlog despite the elevated borrowing costs and uncertain macroeconomic outlookFor example the  Mortgage Average is still highly inflated at 749 059 points MoM 083 YoY as of October 05 2023 compared to the 2019 averages of 38The US housing shortage is likely triggered by the  at 404M units in August 2023 003M MoM 04M YoY as well compared to the hyperpandemic era peak of over 65M homes and August 2019 levels of 525M homesThe combination of reduced inventory and robust housing demand has directly triggered the expansion in the  to 42028K by August 2023 29 YoY 473 from August 2019 median of 28527KBased on these developments Chen Zhao lead of Redfins  economics research also projects that home prices may remain elevated moving forwardFor now DHI has been able to report an  of 91B  51 YoY in FQ323 This is on top of its impressive home land sale gross margins of 232 15 points QoQ 67 YoY compared to the  14 points YoYPart of its tailwinds may be attributed to the managements price adjustments and increased incentives to  caused by higher mortgage ratesThese strategies may have narrowed the gap of the median sales price between  and  to only 54 at 40710K and 43040K by August 2023 respectively This is compared to 11 in August 2022 and 147 in August 2019These developments have naturally resulted in increased demand for new homes as demonstrated by DHIs growing net sales orders of 87B in the latest quarter 11 QoQ 26 YoYDespite these incentives the homebuilding company still records a robust Return On Equity ROE of 243  and a Homebuilding Return On Inventory ROI of 318 over the LTM 99 points sequentiallyThese numbers also well exceed its FY2019 levels of 172 04 points YoY and 181 21 points YoY respectivelyAs a result of its outperformance thus far investors need not fret about DHIs growing total inventories of 2298B in the latest quarter 18 QoQ 61 YoY in our opinion which are compared to its FY2019 levels of 1128B 85 YoYThis is because 448 of its total inventories is attributed to residential lots held for sale 144 is attributed to its ongoing rental portfolio and 337 is attributed to construction in progressWith only a small percentage of its total inventories attributed to completed and unsold units at 69 based on our estimation it is apparent that new housing demand remains red hot no matter the uncertain macroeconomic outlookThe estimated numbers above are based on the DHI managements FQ323 report hereThe DHI management has also offered a FQ423 consolidated revenue guidance of 99B 18 QoQ 28 YoY and home sales gross margins of 2375 at the midpoint 045 points QoQ  compared to For now the Fed expects to achieve its  only by 2026 implying that the higher interest rate environment may also continue for a little longerThese factors point to DHIs likely outperformance over the next few years since the gap between existing and new house median prices may remain narrow for a little longer naturally sustaining its profitability and backlog as discussed aboveFor now DHI mostly trades at impacted FWD valuations compared to its 5Y means though still improved compared to its 1Y means and the sector medians implying Mr Markets confidence in its outperformance compared to its peersFor example DHI is expected to sustain its impressive pandemic eralike outperformance ahead with the consensus FY2025 estimates implying morethandoubled top line expansions and morethantripled bottom line expansions against the prepandemic levels This is on top of the normalized EPS CAGR of 383 between FY2016 and FY2022This growth rate well exceeds the second and thirdlargest homebuilding companies in the US Lennar Corporation  at a normalized CAGR of 264 and PulteGroup  at 28 between FY2016 and FY2022 demonstrating why we believe DHI deserves premium valuationsBased on the consensus FY2026 adj EPS estimates of 1566 and its adj FWD PE valuations of 783x we are also looking at a longterm price target of 12261 implying the DHI stocks decent upside potential of 175 from current levelsThen again thanks to DHIs impressive rally since 2020 the stocks forward dividend yield of 096 appears lackluster compared to its 5Y average of 109 and sector median of 251With it currently retesting its previous 2021 and 2022 resistance levels in the 100s range there may also be moderate volatility in the near termAs a result while there appears to be a relatively attractive risk reward ratio for DHI warranting our Buy rating interested investors may want to observe the situation for a little longer and add according to their dollar cost averagesWhile market analysts from the National Association of Realtors NAR have already postulated the end of  the August 2023 data still indicates a very tight housing supply at 33 months This is compared to the historical  which is associated with moderate price appreciation and a Since 824 of all American homeowners report an average fixedrate mortgage rate of  market supply may remain tight over the next few years of an elevated interest rate environment potentially delaying the eventual recovery of the US property marketWhile DHI is a homebuilding company and therefore not directly exposed to the resale market condition the ongoing headwinds may still pose uncertainty to its eventual valuation and stock recovery This implies that the stock is only suitable for investors who are patient and have a higher risk appetiteLastly investors must also note that the housing market is highly cyclical with the macroeconomic outlook remaining uncertain over the next few years While  is still robust in September 2023 we believe that the housing market may remain sluggish moving forward due to the imbalance between supply and demandThis is a chicken and egg problem in our opinion  The analysis is provided exclusively for informational purposes and should not

277,ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Things Are Likely To Get Worse Before Getting Better - Sell,  Last year Israelbased liner company ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd or ZIM attracted strong retail investor interest dueWhile ZIM barely makes the Top 10 of the worlds largest liner companies the company has pocketed its fair share of the recent container shipping bonanzaSince  on the Big Board in early 2021 ZIM has declared a whopping 3845 per share in dividendsLike all liner companies ZIM has been enjoying recordhigh earnings and cash flows for most of the past two years but with container rates essentially back at prepandemic levels and significantly increased operating expensesLast month ZIM  weak second quarter earnings with freight rates down 67 on a yearoveryear basis thus resulting in negative Adjusted EBIT and Net IncomeZIMs total cash position which includes cash and cash equivalents and investments in bank deposits and other investment instruments decreased by more than 1 billion sequentially to 324 billion mostly due to the massive trueup dividend payment for 2022 and material debt service paymentsNet debt at the end of Q2 was up by almost 10 billion to 16 billion as newbuild deliveries with longterm charter commitments continue to increase the companys lease liabilities a trend which is expected to accelerate over the coming quartersPlease note that yeartodate the company has only taken delivery of four out of a total of 42 publiclydisclosed newbuilds chartered on longterm contracts from various lessors between 2020 and 2022In addition ZIM has recently taken delivery of four 12000 TEU newbuilds from Seaspan but the company has not disclosed the terms of these leasesPlease note that the newbuild vessels are of substantially larger average size than the companys existing fleetWhile ZIM has a total of 47 vessels with lease expirations in 2023 and 2024 even when assuming zero extensions the companys total capacity is going to increase substantially at the worst possible timeMoreover based on managements statements during the questionsandanswers session of the  ZIM is likely to renew the majority of its expiring leases while redelivering only the oldest and least efficient vessels in the fleetFurthermore the company has agreed to make an aggregate 490 million in down payments upon delivery of the Seaspan newbuilds While the new vessels should help reduce unit costs over time they will also increase overall lease expenses and particularly net debt very substantially over the next few quarters For my part I wouldnt be surprised to see the company ending 2024 with well above 5 billion in net debtJust last week competitor AP Møller  Mærsk AS or Maersk     of a further increase in industrywide blanked capacityFollowing a short recovery in July and August container rates have resumed their multiyear decline in recent weeks with rates again approaching postpandemic lowsNot surprisingly the company has reduced its original 2023 outlook substantiallyAssuming ZIMs second half results mirror the first half of the year and considering the abovediscussed down payments upon Seaspan newbuild deliveries I would estimate the companys cash balance to decline to approximately 26 billion by yearendShould 2024 be more of the same I would estimate ZIMs cash balance to decrease by another 1 billion dollars next yearTo put it another way The company needs the market to turn around by 2026 at the latest point to avoid running out of fundsZIM Integrated Shipping Services reported weak second quarter results and reduced fullyear expectations materiallyEven after net cash outflows of more than 1 billion in Q2 the company still commands more than 32 billion in cash bank deposits and liquid investments albeit this number is likely to come down further over the next couple of quartersAssuming no changes in industry conditions the company would likely run out of funds by 2026Considering the weak market environment which is about to be exacerbated by an elevated number of newbuilds scheduled to join the worldwide fleet over the next few quarters I am reiterating my  rating on the sharesA surprise improvement in consumer sentiment would almost certainly result in higher demand for far eastmade goods thus supporting rates on the companys most important Investors should always

in a higher interest rate environment When you are a lender higher interest rates are a good thing for you in the long run After all what do lenders profit from Collecting interestIt is a common theme with investing that Wall Street is frequently nearsighted Panicking over the issues of the moment without regard for whether these issues will be resolved with time The banking industry is alive and well Yes there are issues created by the rapid rate hiking cycle but the Fed is now slowing down As interest rates stabilize absolute higher rates are a positive for banksNext week we will see

the supply and demand dynamics All real estate is local and there is a lot of value in developing in an area where you are already a successful landlordLike most REITs HR has seen its valuation compress thanks to rising interest rates despite the fact that HR has no material debt maturities until 2025 giving them plenty of time for rates to change before they are forced to refinanceNow is a

280,How KNOT Offshore Partners LP Is Poised For Significant Share Price Rebound, is a leading company in the shuttle tanker industry The company operates 18 shuttle tankers out of global feet of 78 The company is listed in New York with a USD175 million form is a master limited partnership MLP and its general partner is Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers Management AS KNOT Management An MLP is a type of publicly traded partnership that combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded companyKNOT Management is responsible for managing KNOPs shuttle tanker fleet and handling the various operational aspects of the business This includes vessel operations maintenance crew management and adherence to safety and environmental standardsAfter the company cut the dividend in January 2023 the stock went down by 70 The company revenuesOnce dividends are reinstated the share price should start regaining the previous trading levels which means tripling the current share price are specialized vessels used to transport crude oil from offshore oil fields to onshore facilities There are only 78 shuttle tankers in the world serving the North Sea and the fields of offshore Brazil They are designed to be able to work on high seas where conventional FPSOs cannot operate The industry was pioneered by Knudsen the parent company in 1978There are only  by three companies in two regions Brazil and Norway Only five new ships have been ordered while over 20 ships that are more than 20 years old should be scraped soon As it takes three years for a ship to be delivered there is very good market visibility for the next at least five years The market on the supply side is tight and with the scraping will get even tighterDemand for shuttle tankers is increasing There is a rapid expansion in production in both the North Sea the large Johan Castberg field for example and Brazil via Petrobras and others will require additional shuttle tankersHigher production new fields about to start producing and limited supply or potential supply of vessels make for a nice bottleneck situation later in 2023 and in 2024 as producers scramble to secure the transport of their oil on shoreIn the 2Q23 the While shuttle tankers can perform the regular function of the regular oil tanker fleet they are a bit slower because they are heavier regular tankers cannot substitute shuttle tankers In periods of lacking demand for shuttle tankers these operate as regular oil tankers which limits the downside When demand is high the rates increase materially This is happening now in the Brazilian market where KNOP operates 14 of its 18 vessels The Norwegian market should tighten from early 2024 as the new fields come into productionSince the 3 Quarter of 2022 KNOP stock has been totally annihilated Several reasons caused the share price fallThe above resulted in a dividend cut from 208year to 011 Reaction to this was predictable Dividend investors sold in droves for tax reasons for the lack of visibility and income Moreover many MLP investors became concerned that the group would buy 70 of what they dont own on the cheap like many other MLP sponsorsAs of 2Q23 none of the adverse scenarios have materialized Most concerns were resolvedThere are only  none of which is materialKNOP secured charter coverage for 2023 is negotiating to extend the two Petrobras tankers coming due and is starting to explore longterm charters for the remaining assets It also appears that the best opportunity to take the company under the sponsor has passed at least at the low As the dividend was decreased the company used its cash to pay down debt The issues have been resolved and the remaining are being addressedThe companys The company position has normalized  KNOP is now in a similar state it was when it was paying above USD2 in dividends per year Gary Chapman Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of KNOT Offshore Partners LP stated emphasis addedDespite all this progress the company has been left for dead Trading at 55 per share it is remaining at a steep discount to the 1520share NAV of the ships and the 34share of free cash flow generating capacitySo what should we expect in 2024 Given that the FCFshare should expand to over 3share there should be a resumption of dividendsIt is not possible to model such a scenario with sufficient accuracy but given the previous precedents it is not hard to imagine a 23share dividend in 2024 and beyond Either way the net present value of any of the outcomes is very attractive At a little over 5 per share we should be able to get all our investment back over the next 3 years or so representing a very attractive IRR Given how oversold the shares are any incremental good news should help to rerate the stock higherSince this is not a biotech stock or economically sensitive equity there are exogenous factors that can affect the stock Delays of the Equinor project geopolitical conflict near the Norwegian waters an accident or a belated offer by the parent company to take the stock under may cause the stock to underperform my expectations However given that the stock is already trading well below steel the riskreward of investing in KNOP is very positiveKNOP is down 70 due to multiple concerns that resulted in a dividend cut Most of the concerns have been resolved and the financial performance remains stable As the issues have been resolved the dividends should be reinstated Before the dividend cut the stock was trading at a dividend yield of over 12 At the current share price the previous dividend would represent a dividend yield of 40 The stock is up for a material rerating   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation

281,PHX Minerals: A Good Natural Gas Royalties Play,  is an independent exploration and production company that primarily operates in the SCOOP and Haynesville Shale plays in Oklahoma Texas and LouisianaThe company does have operations in a few otherAs stated in the introduction PHX Minerals is an independent exploration and production company that primarily operates in the SCOOP and Haynesville Shale regions of Oklahoma Louisiana and Texas but also has operations elsewhere in the country The companys operating locations are not the only unique thing about this company though Its business model is somewhat unique as the company does not actually drill for resources on its acreage Rather it simply takes a royalty or working interest in any well drilled on its landI explained the difference between a royalty and a working interest stake in my previous article on this company but the important thing is that PHX Minerals receives a portion of the production from any well that is drilled on its acreage The well is actually drilled and operated by an upstream exploration and production company such as Southwestern Energy  Continental Resources Chesapeake Energy  and several others depending on the basin in which the company operates However the companys practice of taking a stake in a wells production does expose it to some of the same factors that affect the performance of other energy companies One of the most important of these factors is energy pricesUnfortunately energy prices were something of a drag on PHX Minerals recent financial performance As of the time of writing the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is down 1090 over the past year but it was down quite a bit more over most of the trailing twelvemonth periodThe performance of natural gas has been even worse Natural gas at Henry Hub is down a whopping 6903 over the past twelve monthsThere were a few reasons for this poor performance In the case of crude oil the Federal Government was selling crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for much of the second half of last year as well as through July of this year to attempt to keep the supply of crude oil high and prices down I explained the reasons for the low natural gas prices in a  earlier this year but two of the major reasons were the warm winter and the temporary shutdown of the Freeport LNG facility These two factors caused a glut of natural gas in North America which pushed prices down due to the economic law of supply and demandNatural gas prices are generally more important than crude oil for PHX Minerals due to the production profile of its acreage In the second quarter the company received a total of 2304113 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent Of that 1854485 billion cubic feet was dry natural gas Thus approximately 8049 of the companys business is natural gas as opposed to crude oil or other hydrocarbons Clearly natural gas fundamentals are much more important to the company than crude oil This is a good thing because the longterm fundamentals for natural gas are better than crude oils longterm fundamentals as we will now discussThis decline in resource prices has certainly had an impact on PHX Minerals financial performance In the second quarter of 2023 the amount of natural gas that was produced on the companys acreage was close to record levels but the price was substantially lower than in the same quarter of last yearPHX Minerals reported an adjusted EBITDA of 41 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 72 million in the second quarter of 2022 This lower cash flow is despite the fact that the amount of natural gas that the company received as royalty payments was quite a bit higher than in the same period last year Unfortunately there does not appear to be a nearterm catalyst that would drive natural gas prices back up We are seeing some upstream producers beginning to reduce their production but this will take quite a while to make its way through the system Currently forecasters are  that the upcoming winter will be more typical than last year so that could help reduce some of the natural gas oversupply if they are correct However it remains to be seen if the forecasters are correct about this and how much of an impact it will have on the balance between natural gas supply and demandThe longterm fundamentals for natural gas are much better than the nearterm ones though which is fortunate for PHX Minerals As already mentioned PHX Minerals has significant acreage in the Haynesville Shale The Haynesville Shale is very wellpositioned to supply natural gas to the liquefaction plants that are being constructed along the Gulf Coast The demand from natural gas from these facilities will likely be enormous Indeed Wood Mackenzie states that the liquefaction plants currently under development will increase the demand for natural gas by 10 billion cubic feet per day by 2030It seems reasonable that a significant percentage of the natural gas that will be supplying these plants will be produced in the Haynesville Shale and the Permian Basin This is due mostly to their proximity to the Gulf Coast The other major natural gasproducing region in the United States Appalachia will probably end up supplying East Coast utilities and the handful of liquefaction plants that are being constructed near Philadelphia Pennsylvania As of the time of writing 4874 of PHX Minerals total royalty production is in the Haynesville Shale which is substantially more than any other basinThus it is reasonable to assume that the company will benefit from any growth in natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale After all that scenario would almost certainly result in the companys customers needing to lease more acreage on which to produce natural gas to satisfy the demand PHX Minerals seems to realize this as it has been focusing its recent land acquisitions on the Haynesville Shale We can see that quite easily hereAs we can see about half of the acreage that the company acquired this year was in the Haynesville Shale It was substantially more than half of its acquisitions in 2021 and 2022 This all represents acreage that the company can lease out to its customers Clearly management sees a great deal of opportunity in the Haynesville Shale I do too and this is one of the things that we can appreciate about this companyAs mentioned in the introduction PHX Minerals has a very strong balance sheet We can see this by looking at the net debttoequity ratio As of June 30 2023 PHX Minerals had a net debt of 235 million compared to 1201 million in shareholders equity This gives the company a net debttoequity ratio of 020 today This is lower than the 029 ratio that the company had the last time that we discussed it That is a positive sign as it indicates that the company managed to strengthen its balance sheet somewhat over the past quarter Here is how the company compares to some of its peersI pointed out one important thing for this comparison in my previous article on PHX MineralsThis is a good situation that strongly implies that we should not have to worry too much about the companys leverage The companys use of leverage or lack thereof is somewhat more important for an energy producer like PHX Minerals than it would be for many other companies because of the inherent volatility of energy prices Overall everything looks good hereAs I have pointed out in numerous previous articles pretty much the entire traditional energy sector appears to be substantially undervalued relative to the broader market This continues to be true despite the fact that the energy sector has outperformed the SP 500 Index  by quite a lot over the past month This chart shows the iShares US Energy ETF  against the SP 500 IndexThe weakness in the broader market has brought the forward pricetoearnings ratio of the SP 500 Index to 1988 at the current levelPHX Minerals is quite a bit below this though As of the time of writing the companys forward pricetoearnings is 935  Here is how that compares to the energy producers that we used for the peer comparison earlierPHX Minerals is only the median company here which might imply that the stock is fairly valued However it is clearly substantially well below the comparable ratio for the SP 500 Index As such it is very hard not to call this company undervalued Overall it is probably worth thinking about adding to a portfolio especially if you want to have some exposure to the liquefied natural gas growth storyIn conclusion PHX Minerals is a somewhat unique independent exploration and production company that appears to be wellpositioned to profit from the coming liquefied natural gas boom The companys cash flow has struggled a bit from the lowprice environment but this will hopefully resolve itself as the demand for natural gas continues to grow since producers will probably restrict output until prices rise PHX Minerals Inc stock is trading at a reasonable price and the company boasts a very strong balance sheet Overall it might be worth considering as a play on natural gasAt Energy Profits in Dividends we

282,K2 Hedge Fund Strategy Outlook: Fourth Quarter 2023,Higher macro and market volatility along with greater dispersion creates an environment rich with opportunities for active trading We think the key to success for hedge funds is to identify these opportunitiesThe US Federal Reserve Fed marked an investment regime shift in March of 2022 by raising interest rates and the cost of capital Since then all stakeholders have been in a constant state of adjustment and recalibration We do think that central banks have a big hurdle to tame inflation to their stated target levels As we look at the world today we see real cash rates at very attractive levels the cost of capital rising to even higher levels for companies governments expanding their debt levels increasing costs for consumers and intensified geopolitical tensions We expect the cost of capital to remain high for the foreseeable future as central banks keep the cost of funding elevated to keep inflationary pressures at bay The resultant investment climate is one of increased market volatility across all asset classes more divergent security performance and investors shortening their time horizonEquity market neutral hedge funds are positioned well in our view to capture security dispersion in a responsible riskoriented nondirectional approach We continue to overweight global macro discretionary managers for all the reasons mentioned above but want to highlight that manager selection is of upmost importance in this regime Insurancelinked securities are one of the most idiosyncratic investments to pick up excess yield while offering diversification to portfoliosRates have risen higher and faster than just about any market participant would have predicted two years ago That transition has been difficult for certain assets and investment strategies but history suggests that higher prevailing rates create attractive opportunity sets for hedge funds The table below demonstrates that hedge funds and longshort equity in particular perform better in higher rate regimes which tend to separate winners from losers In a lowrate environment weaker companies can more easily secure financing that financing is less impactful to the bottom line and customers may be less discerning given their own financing situations With rates now significantly higher than they have been for the past decade plus those weaker companies will start to shift to risk management mode while the stronger companies can seize opportunities and profit We believe equity market neutral managers are well suited to capitalize on this setup as returns are very much a function of dispersionCrossasset correlations are a key consideration in most portfolio construction and risk management techniques Many modern investors have implicitly or explicitly built in an assumption of negative correlation between equities and government fixed income over the last few decades However this dynamic has recently flipped with the two asset classes no longer offsetting each others risks and instead seemingly compounding risk within a portfolio Investors may need to seek diversification elsewhere whether through allocations to other asset classes or to tactical trading strategies with no structural long or short biasesMacro managers who tend to focus on these types of bigpicture crossasset relationships as a matter of course and who can shift dynamically between longs and shorts may be facing an attractive trading environment and may also provide a source of muchneeded diversification for broader portfolios To the extent hawkish central bank policy is a contributing factor to this new correlation dynamic we believe those managers with the expertise to evaluate policy paths may be wellsuited to capture the opportunity setThe focus of most ILS managers has shifted to the January renewals as we move through the end of a relatively unimpactful hurricane season at the time of this writing There remains a supply and demand dislocation within the broader insurance and reinsurance markets This dislocation while not as pronounced as last year in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ian is likely large enough for spread and pricing levels to remain elevated Given the increase of demand for risk transfer and relative lack of capacity in traditional reinsurance markets we expect to see several sponsors and cedants utilize the catastrophe bond market to transfer retrocessional and reinsurance risk In response to loss trends and challenging reinsurance markets many cedants have materially

283,Quick Thoughts: Should We Fear The Rapid Rise Of Interest Rates?,Since July bond yields have been on a tear The US 10year Treasury yield has jumped from 375 in the third week of July to a recent high of 481 Rising government bond yields have pushed up new borrowing costs for companies and households For instance the conventional 30year US fixed rate mortgage is about 73 its highest level since 2000 Compared to its lows during the pandemic closer to 4 an American taking out a US325000 mortgage will today pay nearly US10000 more per year in interestRising term premiums haveObserved longterm interest rates often referred to as nominal bond yields can be decomposed into three components 1 the path for the neutral real shortterm rate of interest 2 compensation for expected inflation and 3 the term premiumThe neutral real rate of interest is the rateadjusted for inflationthat neither stimulates nor hinders economic activity It should prevail when the economy is in equilibrium ie enjoying full employment and price stabilityHowever when savers lend money to borrowers they must also consider inflation Inflation erodes the nominal value of their loans Lending rates whether in the form of loans or bonds therefore embed an expectation of future inflation which lenders tack onto the real rate of interest when extending creditFinally lenderswhether individuals banks or bondholderstypically require extra compensation to account for uncertainty and for the likelihood that the value of longterm credits eg bonds will fluctuate more than that of shortterm credits For example the price of a 10year bond will move more in response to a given change in interest rates than the price of a twoyear note As compensation for both uncertainty and price volatility therefore longterm lenders also tack on an additional rate of return commonly referred to as the term premium The term premium explains why yield curves typically slope upward reflecting higher interest rates for longdated notes and bonds relative to shorter maturity borrowingsHeres the rub Real interest rates inflation expectations and term premiums are all unobservable That doesnt prevent clever economists and bonds specialists from trying to estimate them based on other pieces of data Using various analytical approaches it is possible to derive reasonable estimates for all threeArmed with estimates of the real neutral interest rate and expected inflation subtracting those two numbers from the observed bond yield gets you to the term premium The following chart shows one such estimate of the term premium the Federal Reserve Fed Bank of New York developed and how it has behaved since 2009Note that since midJuly the term premium has spiked jumping by 13 percentage points a move that accounts for even more than the observed rise in nominal bond yields Thats because measures of the real rate of interest simultaneously fell and expected inflation only increased a bitMore noteworthy is the fact that term premiums were negative for most of the past decade That flies in the face of theory which says that lenders need to be compensated for longerterm lendingThe negative term premium of recent years reflects several special factors of which probably the most important being the monetary policies of the Fed and other central banks Those had two components 1 largescale asset purchases dubbed quantitative easing or QE for short and 2 forward guidance namely strong reassurances that superlow interest rates and QE would remain in place for considerably longer ie until full employment and price stability had been sustainably restoredAccordingly lenders knew that interest rates would remain stuck at low levels That removed uncertainty that in normal times probably would have prevailed Lenders also didnt have to fret much about the volatility of their longterm bonds given that the actions of central banks firmly pinned down both short and longterm interest rates Extraordinary monetary policies effectively crushed term premiumsthe extra compensation investors would otherwise demand for uncertainty and volatilityAs previously noted the components of the nominal bond yield cannot be observed That leaves open room for doubt For example using different methodology the Fed Bank of Richmond has constructed a measure of the neutral real interest rate thatin contrast to the one the New York Fed producedindicates that the neutral real rate has recently been rising If so then the term premium has not been the only reason behind the recent surge in bond yieldsIn our view however the New York Feds approach to disentangling bond yields is more persuasive To state it as simply as possible if the Richmond Feds estimates of a rising neutral real rate were correct it would imply that the economys speed limit would have acceleratedThat seems unlikely as there is little evidence in the incoming productivity data to warrant that conclusion For wellknown demographic reasons the growth of the labor force has slowed And if trend growth were accelerating why would it have suddenly jumped in mid2023 Finally and perhaps most importantly if the US economy were suddenly embarking on faster noninflationary growth the equity market would probably be leaping ahead Instead since midyear it has stumbledIn short the New York Feds estimates of the real neutral rate and by extension of the term premium are more closely aligned with other data gleaned from the economy and markets The term premium appears to us to be the primary culprit for rising bond yields in recent monthsSome observers have argued that the latest jump in bond yields is tied to changes in the supply and demand for bonds Little wonder Just as the Fed and other central banks have stepped back from bond buying and have shrunk the holdings of bonds by not replacing all of those that mature governments around the world have run up big deficits requiring heavier bond issuance In the United States the issuance calendar has become particularly loaded in 2023 as the Treasury had to also replace depleted cash levels from earlier this year when it was trying to prevent a US default stemming from Congress delay in raising the debt ceilingYet all these things have been knownknowns for much of this year even in the secondquarter of 2023 when interest rates were much lower than today So those who argue that a combination of QT and big budget deficits are behind rising bond yields are left without an answer to why now To us the timing of the latest surge in bond yields is difficult to explain merely in supplydemand termsFinally it is worth recalling that the US economy has proven resilient to the massive Fed rate hikes since early 2022 Fiscal stimulus the ability of households to draw on savings a tight labor market and a greater reliance on fixed rate borrowing insulatingfor a timehouseholds and companies from higher borrowing costs explain that resilience But consequently the Fed has clearly signaled that its policy will remain tight for longer The Feds resolve to see the economy weaken to assure its inflation target is met has probably contributed to the rise in yields because it has removed hopes for rate cuts in 2024 Still it remains a mystery why 10 and even 30year bond yields should have reacted so strongly to changes in interest rate expectations over the next few quarters Hence even high for longer cannot fully account for the observed rise in bond yields since JulyOur conclusion therefore is that rising term premiums are behind the rise in bond yields For the economy it is important to note that resilience is not forever New borrowers and those who must roll over their maturing debts will soon have to pay much higher borrowing costs as highlighted in the example at the beginning of this note Moreover there is some evidence that the labor market is showing signs of softeningStudies from the Fed Bank of San Francisco show that household excess savings are almost depleted And additional shots of fiscal stimulus are unlikely given Washington gridlock Accordingly an economy that was almost certainly set to slow now runs a greater risk of recession That matters for equity and credit investors where asset values depend on corporate profits Before the latest jump in interest rates optimism was growing about the outlook for higher corporate profits later this year and in 2024 That optimism had helped to underpin strong 2023 gains in equity markets Now investors must wonder if those expectations werent too rosyHigher US yields also boost the value of the dollar All else equal that tends to undermine commodity prices And on cue oil prices have recently plunged Meanwhile a strong dollar is not welcome in some parts of the world Japan is reported to have intervened to prevent the yen from sliding below 150 versus the dollar Emerging fixed income and equity markets typically fare poorly when the dollar becomes too strong Finally no region has been spared higher yields stemming from rising US rates Bond yields in the eurozone which is already teetering on the edge of recession are heading higherBond yields have surged Many explanations have been offered We think it is mostly about term premiums But whatever the cause the effect is mostly unpleasant Unless bond yields settle back into lower ranges global growth is likely to be lower profits expectations will come under pressure and risks to equities and credit fixed income markets will be on the rise are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal involve interest rate credit inflation and reinvestment risks and possible loss of principal As interest rates rise the value of fixed income securities falls Lowrated highyield bonds are subject to greater price volatility illiquidity and possibility of default are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations and social economic and political uncertainties which could increase volatility These risks are magnified in emerging marketsThe governments participation in the economy is still high and therefore investments in China will be subject to larger regulatory risk levels compared to many other countries____________1 Source Bloomberg As of October 12 20232 Source Freddie Mac As of October 5 2023 The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha

284,I Believe Rio Tinto Is A Long-Term Bargain Thanks To Net Zero,Its time to talk about mining and the climate In this case well discuss the impact of climate measures on metals demand and related developmentsOn May 15 I wrote an  titled For example an electric car requires more than 5x more metal than a conventional car Offshore wind requires massive amounts of copper and zinc Solar requires silicon and copperIn this article Im updating the bull case using new findings and new data on  own progress The company is tremendously wellpositioned to benefit from rising copper demand robust iron ore demand and investments in rare earths like lithiumISo lets dive into the detailsAlthough I have 20 fossil fuel exposure Im not opposed to clean energy On the contrary the reason why I own so much oil exposure is that I do not trust the way governments are handling the energy transition Its a way to protect myself against energy inflation not a protestA forced energy trend leads to inflation especially because were now closing perfectly fine coal plants and reducing investments in affordable energy sourcesThe problem is that the energy transition requires a lot of time and resources This cannot be forcedFor example looking at the data below we see that according to the IEA demand for rare earths will explode Under current government policies we could see close to 15 kilotonnes of rare earth demand by 2040 If we follow sustainable development goals that number could be 35 kilotonnes Right now that number is barely a fraction of thatThe chart below also shows that China dominates the production of rare earths  even after accelerated investments by other nationsTo make things worse China does not only mine 70 of global rare earths but it processes 87 of it and refines 91 of itIn other words if Western nations the main drivers behind net zero want to expand their footprint new mining needs to be accelerated not just because of a lack of demandThats where Rio Tinto comes in  reported last month that the company is on its way to becoming a meaningful lithium producer focusing on its own capacities instead of buying other producersAccording to the article emphasis addedHaving said that lets take a closer look at how RIO is doingDespite strong secular tailwinds RIOs stock price isnt going anywhere The problem is that cyclical growth is weakLooking at COMEX Copper futures we see that prices are elevated compared to prepandemic levels but well below the postpandemic highsI believe that favorable supply and demand dynamics prevent commodity prices from going much lower This was different in the years between 2011 and 2020It also helps RIOs financialsDespite challenging operating conditions Rio Tinto showed resilience in the first half of this year achieving solid underlying earnings of 57 billion a free cash flow of 38 billion a 20 return on capital employed and a 5 production increase in the first half of 2023As a result the company will return 29 billion to shareholders reflecting its disciplined capital allocation and maintaining a net debt of around 4 billionThe company also made a number of strategic investmentsAs one can imagine commodity prices were a significant factor impacting financials with a notable decline in prices for iron ore copper and aluminum compared to the first half of 2022Also during the earnings call it was noted that despite some moderation in inflation it continued to affect costs The firm also reported cost pressures due to tight labor markets and operational issues in specific projectsThe Iron Ore business remained a strong performer benefitting from increased sales and production notably from GudaiDarri The aluminum business saw operational improvement with metal volumes up 9 due to the recovery at Kitimat The highlight was Oyu Tolgois first sustainable copper production a significant milestone for the company However operational challenges were noted in Escondida and KennecottHaving said that and with regard to the aforementioned growth plans Rio Tinto plans to steadily increase capital allocation for essential CapEx sustaining and replacing projects and decarbonization effortsGrowth investments including Simandou and other potential projects are in the pipeline The company outlined a clear capital expenditure profile expecting CapEx to rise to 10 billion in each of the next two yearsDuring its earnings call the company made clear that it sees opportunities in sustainable metals production driven by increased demand in sectors like solar panels and electric vehiclesThe trajectory of aluminum demand in the solar sector especially in China is promising EV sales growth supported by government policies globally is expected to boost copper demand benefiting Rio Tinto These trends align with their strategy for growth in aluminum and carbon productionHowever in China the company sees slowing iron ore demandAccording to In light of these investments the company maintained its commitment to dividend payouts declaring a 50 payout to shareholders amounting to 29 billion in the first half of this year as I already briefly mentionedWhen it comes to financial stability the company has an Arated balance sheet with a sub05x net leverage ratioSo what about its valuationThe chart below shows the percentage RIO shares are trading below their alltime high compared to the ISM Manufacturing Index my favorite economic indicator As we already briefly discussed cyclical headwinds are overshadowing secular growth tailwindsNonetheless analysts are very positive about the stockThe consensus price target hasnt declined since early 2022 and is still at 80 roughly 27 above the current price Even the lowest price target is above the current priceRIO shares are trading at just 47x forward EBITDA which is one of the best valuations of the past ten yearsI believe that RIO has the potential to soar well beyond 80 or 90 per share over the next 23 yearsHowever I also believe that as long as global economic growth indicators are hinting at elevated recession odds we wont see much upsideHence my strategy would be to accumulate RIO shares on weakness If I didnt have so much cyclical exposure already I would be a gradual buyer at current prices If it drops further investors can average downFor now I own Caterpillar  which is highly correlated to mining stocksEventually I believe that RIO is poised to benefit from a perfect storm of cyclical and secular tailwinds pushing commodity prices beyond prior highsAt that point growth investments will pay off allowing the company to benefit from better prices and higher volumesAs a result I will stick to a  rating which I will upgrade the moment we get a rebound in cyclical growth expectationsIn a world where climate measures are reshaping the mining landscape its essential to understand the growing demand for metals in the transition to netzero technologiesRio Tinto a major player in the mining industry is strategically positioned to capitalize on this demand surge particularly in lithium for electric vehicles aluminum and copperDespite cyclical challenges the company shows resilience with solid financials and strategic investments in various projects to sustain and grow supplyIts commitment to sustainability and growth combined with an attractive valuation suggests promising potentialGiven ongoing economic uncertainties accumulating Rio Tinto shares during market dips could be the way to goUltimately Rio Tinto is wellpoised to capitalize on both cyclical and secular industry shifts making it a promising longterm investmentJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs Preferreds BDCs MLPs ETFs and other income

285,Orient Overseas International: Weakening Freight Environment Leads To Downgrade,In our  on Orient Overseas International Limited   from the 1st of May this year we concluded that our view ofThe share price is down 24 since our previous article which had a Hold stance However due to the monstrous dividend payment the return for investors has been a positive 4OROVY published its FH 2023 financial results at the end of August so we want to revisit the thesis againThey say that a picture can tell a thousand wordsThis graph from OROVYs  shows howIt was not so much the volume that dropped it was the freightThe total number of containers shipped in FH of 2023 was only reduced by 1 but the revenue from the operation dropped by 59 YoY The operating costs only dropped by 26The main reason for this large difference between the drop in revenue and cost lies in the fact that OROVY needs to pay charter hire on vessels chartered in regardless of whether they sail or notTheir lease commitments on vessels chartered in as of 30th June 2023 stood at 382 million spread evenly over the next five years OROVY should be able to trim their fleet even in the SH of 2023 as more than 30 vessels totaling over 200000 TEU capacity are coming off charter in SH of 2023That is good newsTheir Capex requirements as of 30th June 2023 were 375 billion which is mostly payments to be made on their newbuilds Most of this will be financed so it is not a total drain of cashOn the topic of cash it is quite large at 78 billion but it is important to note that they did burn 34 billion over the last twelve months Since it would be too optimistic to expect a quick recovery in the market it will only take a couple of years and that cash pile will have disappearedTo get a better understanding of this cash drain you may want to read SAs excellent contributor Henrik Alexs last   which is in the same predicament as they too will burn cash We agree with his thoughts that the negative cash effect of having expensive vessels under charter and a falling freight rate environment will cause cash to be drainedOROVY will be able to release a portion of these vessels throughout 2023 and early 2024 This will help their situation On the other hand they have new building payment installments to be made which is also a negative impact on their cash flowThis leaves us with the topic of dividends It surprised us that the company decided to pay a large dividend and even a special dividend for the interim period of FH 2023After all the operating cash flow in FH was 548 million a far cry from the 624 billion it was a year earlier From this cash flow they will pay out to shareholders a regular interim dividend amounting to 4556 million plus a special dividend of 1123 millionHere is their dividend history over the last five yearsIt is in our opinion not prudent to distribute more in dividends than what the free cash flow is Especially in view of the challenging market conditionOROVY did not do any share buyback over the last six monthsIt is as we just mentioned a challenging market One could say it is the perfect storm with a reduction in demand and an increase in supplyIt is particularly the supply that is the most worrisome and this author has pointed this out in several articles covering companies such as SFL Corporation  and Maersk A vast majority of the new ships coming out are large vessels plying the main routesTo make things worse there is not enough scrapping of tonnageEven the pointed out in their FH 2023 financial report that demand is not coming back any time soonThese comments came in relation to a liability they have toward Long Beach Container Terminal which is lasting for 20 years from October 2019 OROVY has guaranteed a certain minimum volume for each contract year Failing to meet this they will have to pay the terminal owners a compensation It has been estimated they need to make a provision of 894 million to cover thisIt is difficult to predict Especially about the future as the Danish physicist Niels Bohr is said to have proclaimedHow will the economy look like a year from nowWe can only rely on past data of supply and demand and try to inject a reasonable estimate of what it is going to be in the relatively near future of say one year Even the respectable economist John Galbraith once said thatOur prediction is that the giant liner companies will have no choice but to fight for the business of filling up the growing fleet of vessels by offering lower pricesAt least for the next two years What happens thereafter is anybodys guessThe risk to the thesis is that we misjudge the supplydemand equation A sharp improvement in demand could help OROVY to deal with the oversupply of new vesselsHowever we believe the chance of this is smallWe believe lower freight and volume will continue to drain liner companies such as OROVY of muchneeded cash and dividends will be a thing of the pastIn terms of putting a valuation on OROVY many fellow authors here on SA like to use the traditional method of PriceBook value From that perspective OROVY and most of its peers look very attractive although OROVY is not as attractive as its peersIn a falling market which all of them are experiencing how much you theoretically could get for the assets is not that importantSurviving  that is what matters nowFortunately for most of them they do have manageable debt loads Now they need to batten down the hatches and sail through this storm as they have done in the pastWe cannot put an exact price where we would judge OROVY to be a fair price Lower or no earnings will resent any kind of valuation we may put on itWe believe the share prices will come down and that is the main reason why we are inclined to downgrade OROVY from a Hold to a SellEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these

286,"Valero: Despite Massive Strength, I'm Considering Selling (Rating Downgrade)",Its time to discuss an investment that has been with me since I started my current dividend growth portfolio in 2020 I bought  during the depths of the pandemic whenWhile I was unable to buy it at the bottom I was down more than 20 at some point the stock has turned into one of my best investments returning almost 200 excluding dividendsIm bringing this up because the company has gone from an underperformer with many issues and a high risk of dividend cuts to a company that is firing on all cylindersNot only is it benefiting from ongoing strength in gasoline demand favorable margins and past tailwinds that have resulted in a tsunami of cash but also newThe bull case has gotten so good that Im considering taking some money off the table  especially in light of potential economic issues down the roadIn this article I will share my thoughts and discuss the companys riskreward so investors know whats going on in my mindLets start with the bigger pictureThe chart below shows the relationship between the VLO stock price  below its alltime high and the ISM Manufacturing Index my favorite leading indicator for economic growthWhile the correlation is far from perfect we see that economic downtrends almost always result in steep losses for VLO investors Almost alwaysRight now VLO shares are up 16 yeartodate less than 4 below their alltime highMeanwhile the ISM Index has been below 50 the neutral line between growth and contraction for ten consecutive monthsDespite economic headwinds refining companies enjoy strong tailwinds that are mainly supplyrelatedEarlier this month  highlighted some of the biggest issues driving favorable refining marginsAccording to the article oil executives are seeing a critical issue of inadequate crudeprocessing capacity due to a lack of investment coupled with more frequent shutdowns as refiners prioritize higher margins and defer planned maintenanceThis pattern emerged during the APPEC by SP Global Insights conference held in Singapore The consequence of this situation is the heightened vulnerability of fuel prices particularly diesel and gasoline to abrupt fluctuations whenever unexpected outages occurFor example unplanned plant shutdowns have been occurring almost weekly in EuropeAccording to Bloomberg Frederic Lasserre global head of research  analysis at Gunvor Group Ltd makes the case that many refiners have delayed routine maintenance making them susceptible to unexpected technical glitches resulting in surprise outagesEspecially after the pandemic too much supply was offline which forced refineries to produce at elevated utilization ratesNot only is this an issue in Europe but stockpiles are tight in generalIn the United States inventories for finished products are dropping faster than expectedTo make things worse Russia is increasingly using its energy leverageOn September 21  reported that Russia is temporarily banning exports of diesel in order to support domestic supplies This hurts Europe and global supply in general After all if one region sees a lower supply it needs to import from other regionsHaving said all of this instead of easing prices due to new postpandemic supply the situation remains tight pressured by outages persistent demand and new geopolitical issuesRefinery companies are winning big timeOver the past three years Americas two pureplay refinery stocks Marathon Petroleum  and Valero Energy are up 439 and 234 respectively I excluded Phillips 66  due to its massive footprint in chemicalsWith this in mind what do we make of VLO at these pricesIn the second quarter the company massively benefited from the aforementioned tailwindsIts refineries had a throughput capacity utilization of 94 capitalizing on tight product supply and strong product demand in the USThe company also started its Port Arthur coker which has the capability of adding up to 100 thousand barrels of crude oil capacity to the companys daily capacityValero also expanded its renewable productsLooking forward Valero anticipates that low global light product inventories and tight supplyanddemand balances will continue to support refining fundamentalsGlobal demand for transportation fuels has rebounded substantially with gasoline and diesel demand on par with prepandemic levels and steady growth in jet fuel demandThis outlook reinforces the companys dedication to its core strategy of operational excellence capital discipline and delivering on its commitment to shareholder returnsWhen it comes to its commitment to shareholder returns the company is seeing tailwinds that were unimaginable a few years agoFor example in 2012 the company spent more than 100 of depreciation and amortization on sustaining capital expenditures In 2022 that number was 55 indicating much more efficient operationsFurthermore the companys total CapEx requirements are below the longerterm average thanks to lower growth CapEx as major projects have progressed nicely over the past few years generating additional earningsHence after spending 2020 and 2021 protecting the  the company is now back on track repurchasing stock and raising its dividendLast year alone the company distributed 61 billion to shareholders which was a blowout record and still less than 50 of its net incomeIn the second quarter the company made clear that it has a strategy of balancing dividends with share repurchases to ensure an optimal allocation of capital to provide returns to shareholdersAs the overview above shows Valeros share repurchase program is a fundamental element of its capital allocation strategyThe significant allocation of funds amounting to 951 million in the second quarter for the repurchase of shares shows the companys confidence in its growth trajectory and belief in the intrinsic value of its shares buying back shares when the valuation looks attractiveThe repurchase of roughly 84 million shares in the quarter alone reflects the proactive steps Valero is taking to manage its outstanding shares and potentially enhance shareholder valueHaving said that the current dividend yield is 28 which is nothing to write home about at least not in the energy sector where drillers often pay much higher yieldsOn January 31 the company hiked by 41 which shows that it is still mainly focused on buybacks instead of hiking its quarterly dividend commitmentNonetheless going forward I expect dividend growth to pick upThe company has a sub03x net leverage ratio which is one of the best numbers in its sector It is expected to lower net debt to less than 3 billion next year and free cash flow expectations indicate a 12 free cash flow yield next yearIn other words if the company were to spend every penny of free cash flow on distributions it could distribute 123 of its market cap to shareholdersIm not saying that will happen but it shows how much cash this company is generatingNote that free cash flow is expected to fall in the years ahead This is not an indication that Valero is doing something wrong It shows that analysts are expecting a normalization in refining margins as no analyst is willing to incorporate prolonged geopolitical issues and other supply forces in their estimates I can get behind thatHowever it means that any tailwinds could lead to higher expectations for the quarters and years aheadThis part is so tricky Not only because nobody knows how long refinery margins will remain tight but also because the global economy isnt doing so well right now We could easily run into a scenario where demand destruction offsets tight supplyHaving said that the company is trading at less than 4x 2023E EBITDA That number rises to 66x 2025E EBITDA due to the aforementioned decline in expected marginsIf we apply an 8x multiple we get a price target of 177 The current consensus price target is 145 a dollar below the current priceMy opinion is that the company will generate higherthanexpected earnings including EBITDA and free cash flow over the next few years I do not expect supply to rebound as quickly as expected and Im also not a supporter of the thesis that quick EV adoption will significantly hurt demandIf anything emerging demand in markets like Asia and Africa will likely provide strong export demand growth for decades to comeHaving said that Im considering selling a bit of VLOThis is not a call to get people to sell VLO This is just my view on the midterm riskrewardI believe that VLO has a very bright future and if I decide to sell I will be on the hunt to buy back at lower prices That could be triggered by a further decline in economic growth causing potential demand destruction to offset supply tailwindsValero Energy has transformed from a struggling investment to a major successThe refining industry despite economic headwinds is thriving due to supplyrelated factors Recent geopolitical shifts like Russias temporary diesel export ban emphasize thisValeros strategic growth and financial discipline bode well for investors The companys prudent capital allocation strategy boasting a sub03x net leverage ratio signifies a commitment to shareholder returnsNonetheless given the current riskreward and other investment opportunities Im considering selling a bit of Valero Energy Corporation to potentially

operational excellence efforts improve our efficiencies in Big Bird We continue to further diversify our portfolio in both branded fresh products and prepared offerings given our growth with leading retailers and food service providers Based on this combinated efforts the US improve its profitability compared to previous quartersAs for the UK and Europe we further diversify our marketplace presence through branded innovation and recently launched new products secured additional long term supply arrangements with key customers and drove further efficiencies in our manufacturing network and back office to operational excellence As a result we have reinforced our foundations for profitable growthIn Mexico we experienced a strong third quarter given improvements in live operations favorability and feed inputs and currency and balance supply and demand fundamentals Our diversification through branded and prepare offerings continue to gain marketplace traction and our operational excellence efforts to drive efficiencies and expand capacities remain on trackIn the third quarter of 2023 ready to cook production of US chicken experienced a decrease of 19 relative to the same period last year USDA estimates primarily influenced by fewer headcounts along with more typical changes in industry production given seasonal trends The most recent USDA outlook for Q4 of 2023 indicates that the industry continues to reduce excess and chicks placement relative to last year suggesting a more restrained supply scenario in the near futureConcerning our cold storage supply reported September 2023 USDA cold storage inventories are below prior year and indicate the levels have declined relative to June 2023 Breast meat remains in line with the end of June levels and dark meat inventories continue to trend below last yearConsidering the overall supply of protein USDA expect a slight reduction in domestic protein availability for the remainder of the calendar 2023 This reflects a view of slow growing broiler supply compared with contracting beef and pork availability With relative lower beef and pork availability food inflation higher than historical average and current economic uncertainty chicken may be advantaged given its availability affordability and flexibilityDomestic volume demand for chicken improved significantly in the third quarter of 2023 The retail channel momentum continued providing more balanced growth in volumes across all departments The fresh department was supported by volume growth coming across both front half and back half cuts and we are finally seeing increased promotional activitiesWe remain positive on the potential of this category expected in competing protein supplies increasing competing meat prices and more normal promotional activity has contributed to consistent sales volumes over the quarter Elsewhere in the retail category the frozen department has added incremental volume and unit sales and we are now seeing volume sales growth from both the commodity and valueadded frozen segments Meanwhile the dairy prepared department has steadily added in both units and dollar salesIn the foodservice channel volume sales also increased Commercial distribution volume demand has improved as the number of operators purchasing chicken has grown and those operators already with chicken have experienced an increase in velocity Similar to retail Q3 of this year was reflected of a more balanced volume growth across front half cuts and back half cuts The noncommercial distribution subchannel increased volumes albeit at relatively lower prices compared to the record prices of last yearAs a result of improving retail and food service volume sales and balanced supply during the quarter wholesale pricing for commodity chicken experienced price improvements during August and September especially on breast meat and tenders providing a lift to cut out pricingCommodity prices have recently reverted to the normal seasonal pricing patterns and are now close to historical leverage which is not a sustainable level considering the industrys elevated costs from grain labor and other inputs relative to prepandemic levels Nonetheless the supply and demand balance appears to be improving as we enter Q4 of 2023On the exports Q3 was remarkably stable and with solid demand for US broiler The reduction of 22 on yearoveryear exports was mainly driven by China where sales were down 28 mainly due to ongoing high path avian influenza and relative limited eligibility for export among poultryproducing states Excluding this impact US exports will have been up 25 yearoveryear a good indication that strong demand exists for US products globallyHigh path avian influenza emerging commercial turkey flock towards the end of September and beginning of October Although these were the first deductions since midApril and occur far from major broiler producing states it does increase vigilance throughout the industry As for business implications most of our trading partners have adjusted their trade restrictions to reflect impact zones or states in the event of a commercial outbreakOther than China we do not expect to see material disruption to trade in the event of an HPAI break in commercial broiler Consistent with the previous quarter as volume sales have maintained growth in the channel US cold storage inventories of combined dark meat have trended below a year ago and up 19 below the fiveyear average Driven by a 32 reduction in yearoveryear last quarter inventories at the end of SeptemberBased on our current trajectory we expect our exports to continue to outpace last year as we further diversify our client base and country of destination portfolios Were exporting supporting an already healthy US dark meat market potentially exists for relatively strong pricing and demand than typical expected in the fourth quarterTurning to feed ingredients Harvest is progressing in the US despite belowtrend yields the historically large corn acreage has contributed to a recovery in US corn ending stocks for the 23 24 crop year Production is forecast at just over 15 billion bushels making the largest crop since 2016 Ending stocks are currently forecasted at 21 billion bushels an increase of 55 yearoveryearThe large US production comes certainly after a record Brazilian corn crop that is still compete priced Global ending stocks for 23 24 are forecasted to sell 14 million metric tons assuming favorable South American weather and Argentinas production returns to normal levels after a remarkably weak prior year As for soybeans US crop is estimated to be nearly 4 lower yearoveryear because of a reduced acreage and limited yield improvements resulting in another year with historical low ending stocksNonetheless last years record crop in Brazil remained competitive in export markets creating a large demand for the US production Though only in the planting stage both Brazil and Argentina soycrops are expected to be larger yearoveryear boosting global supply like corn South American weather will be key in realizing growthUS soybean meal market should be well supplied given continued crush industry expansion assuming Argentinas forecast rebound in soybean production is realized Further price pressure could arise Although soybean or inflows can be heavily influenced by biofuel policies The growth in production and diversification of import inflows should balance supply and demandTurning to wheat Global production is currently forecast to fall by 6 million metric tons from last year largely driven by a drop from Russias record crop In US wheat production increased 44 million metric tons from last year whereas Australia and Argentina estimates have been reduced given slightly unfavorable growing conditions Black Sea exports continue without an agreement between Russia and Ukraine that should be monitoredOur US business continued to navigate very volatile market fundamentals in big bird segment along with persistent consumer inflation Our diversified portfolio across bird sizes mitigated this prolonged challenges and we maintain our intense focus and operational excellence and cultivation of key customer partnerships Within big bird the team continue to drive action points to further enhance operational excellence in our manufacturing locationsDuring the quarter we achieved improvements in production efficiencies both at the live operations and other clients These efforts were also aided by enhanced market fundamentals during the quarter but work still remains to consistently realize sustainable margin levelsIn case ready the team improved our volumes to keep customer partnerships We increase distribution additional promotional activity and improvement mix In addition the team maintained its operational excellence in both quality and service levels despite significant disruptions from Hurricane Idalia in the Southeastern United States Equally important we further diversify our sales pipeline we differentiated high attribute effort that helps driving traffic and differentiation to our key customersSmall Bird remains strong given stable demand from QSRs robust daily performance with key customers and sustained operational excellence Given their consistent quality and service levels the team secured additional business throughout the quarter and beyond across retail and foodservice Our efforts to further diversify our portfolio to prepare foods continue to gain momentumAs the team realized significant growth through increased distribution promotional activities and innovation In retail our fully cooked branded offerings Just BARE and Pilgrims collectively grew 65 compared to last year Within foodservice the team reinvigorated growth with distributors schools and commercial chains through our targeted expansion teamsDigitally influenced sales continue to play a role on commerce for prepared branded offerings Our key customer media partnerships and investments have demonstrated their effectiveness as clickthrough rates are nearly double industry standards and consumer acquisition costs have fallen off Equally important digitally sales increased 90 over the past yearGiven the exceptionally wellreceived shopper reaction we look forward to increase partnership through the trade to further diversify our portfolio through branded offerings Similar to the US our UK and European business experienced an environment with continued consumer inflation Improved pork fundamentals and relative affordability of chicken help mitigate this impact but the team remains focused on our strategiesTo that end the business trended its key customer partnership with leading retailers and foodservice providers through targeted promotional activities and customerspecific offerings The team also secured additional longterm business with selected retailers through efficient supply chain capabilities and differentiated product offeringsOur diversification through branded products continue to progress as both Fridge Raiders and the Richmond brands gained share throughout the quarter Innovation also continues to play a key role as we launched over 100 items many of which are designed to reinvent our fresh meals categoryOur new product performance is becoming increasingly recognized throughout the trade as we receive multiple awards for development and launch execution We continue to drive diversification and key customer focus through operational excellence efforts Todate weve made significant progress in the optimization of our manufacturing network and backoffice support activitiesMoving forward will explore additional opportunities throughout our production footprint to increase efficiencies and drive scale to meet our growth aspirations We will also continue to closely monitor various economic indicators Wage growth is now ahead of inflation and consumer confidence has resumed in support trajectoryBased on these factors consumers may be willing to increase protein consumption trade up within retail or pursue awayfromhome eating opportunities in foodservice Given our diversified portfolio and key customer presence across channels and operational capabilities we are positioned to adjust to these trends and accelerate our growthTurning to Mexico The business experienced a strong performance in the third quarter given improvements in live operation grain and currency favorability and more balanced supply and demand fundamentals in the region The business strengthening its key customer focus given continued growth with leading retailers and QSRs Equally important our diversification efforts through branded offerings continue to gain traction among retailers and consumers alikeIn Prepared Foods the Pilgrims brand grew doubledigits compared to last year whereas our recent Just BARE launch has been exceptionally well received through the marketplace Moving forward well further cultivate our branded presence through additional marketing support for the Unique Taste and Favorites and the introduction of a Just BARE fresh offeringWe continue our commitment to driving profitable growth through continued investment and operational excellence We have completed our expansion in the Merida region and expect to initiate production in the first quarter of 2022 increasing the geographical diversification of our progress Also our projects to enhance biosecurity for live operations our progress as planned and it should be completed according to scheduleWere also proud to have published our sustainability report in September to highlight our continued progress on our journey to become a leader in environment social and governance matters We have made significant progress against the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals since 2019 as our team members Global Safety Index improved by 54 and our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse emissions intensity fell by 20We continue to invest in the communities in which we serve as we have funded over 50 million in projects through our Hometown Strong initiatives and we provided higher education tuition fee for 350 team members all members of their families to our better futuresHi good morning everyone This is Matt GalvanoniFor the third quarter of 2023 net revenues were 436 billion versus 447 billion a year ago with adjusted EBITDA of 324 million in a margin of 74 compared to 4605 million and a 103 margin in Q3 last year Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 70 in the US compared to 147 a year agoFor our UK and Europe business adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 61 for Q3 compared to 40 last year In Mexico adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 124 compared to a loss of 15 a year agoMoving to the overall US results our adjusted EBITDA for Q3 came in at 1741 million compared to quarterly profit of 4183 million a year ago when the Jumbo Cutout was just starting to come off its alltime highs Over the last three quarters weve grown US profitability sequentially despite volatile market conditionsOur key customer partnerships helped drive strength in our caseready business during Q3 and we see further momentum in retail volumes continuing Also the US Small Bird and Prepared Foods businesses continued to their strong 2023 performance during the third quarter Our Big Bird business realized quarteroverquarter improvements through a combination of operational excellence programs and enhanced market fundamentalsIn the UK and Europe adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was 804 million versus 485 million in 2022 Through its previously discussed operational excellence efforts the business improved profitability over 65 yearoveryear and it is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequentially increasing profitabilityDuring Q3 the business also continued to benefit from the back office integration and its network optimization programs As inflation moderates the UK consumer should return to more normal shopping patterns enabling further growth for our businessMexico generated 695 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q3 compared to a loss of 63 million last year The Mexican businesses experienced more balanced supply demand fundamentals or reduction in birds disease challenges and its live operations due to teams extraordinary efforts and foreign currency favorability Overall our SGA in the quarter was lower yearoveryear primarily due to a decrease incentive compensation and legal defense costs in the US as well as other targeted cost efficiencies achieved in the US and UK Europe businessesWe spent 146 million in CapEx in the third quarter which is higher on a more normalized run rate basis primarily due to our investments in the Athens Georgia expansion and construction of our new protein conversion plant in South Georgia We reiterate our commitment to investment in strong ROCE projects that will improve our operational efficiencies through automation and tailor our operations to address key customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for PilgrimsAlthough the US chicken commodity market has been quite volatile over the last year our overall balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong As of the end of the third quarter we had over 2 billion in total cash and revolver availability After quarterend in early October we completed a 500 million long 10year notes offering and paid off our 2027 notes through a tender operating processAlso in October we entered into a new five year US credit facility which was upsized by 50 million to 850 million is now unsecured Were pleased with the results of these recent transactions and the overall interest in our debt offerings Following these transactions our net debt maturity is now not until 2031 Our liquidity position provides us flexibility during times of volatility in the US commodity markets and allows us to explore further growth opportunitiesAs at the end of Q3 our net debt was approximately 28 billion with the leverage ratio of 35x our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA which is outside of our target ratio range of 2x to 3x We anticipate this quarter to be the peak of our leverage ratio as were about to last very challenging fourth quarter 22 and first quarter 2023 results given the depressed US commodity market pricing during those periodsNet interest expense in the quarter totaled 335 million We anticipate our full year net interest expense to be approximately 160 million excluding refinancing costs Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 268 and 98 yeartodate We are now estimating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 14 As a reminder this amount could fluctuate depending on the final mix of earnings across our tax jurisdictionsOur capital allocation approach will remain disciplined as we look to grow the company and will continue to align our investment priorities and their overall strategies and portfolio diversification Key customer growth operational excellence and commitment to team member health and safetyOperator this concludes our prepared remarks Please open the call for questionsOperator Instructions Our first question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays Please go aheadGood morning Fabio and Matt Congrats on the very strong results On the two questions so first of all we saw a very nice improvement and continued improvement just sequentially as it relates to the business in the US from an operating income perspective Now as we look into next year and assuming maybe Mexico to stay as strong in the UK as well to continue to improve How do you think about the potential of profitability in 2024 Or in other words do you think its achievable to reach what would be more of a normalized level of 6 to 8 operating income margins in 2024 That would be my first questionSure Thanks for the question Ben as always we look at our differentiated portfolio We created this portfolio a long time ago where we target to have a portfolio that can capture upside on the commodity market So we have a big exposure to the commodity in the US with the Big Bird operation but we can protect the downside and have more stable business with our kids ready our Prepared Foods and our Small Bird businessIf you look at the performance this year the Small Bird the Prepared Foods and the case ready has performed really well At the same level as the year before What has been very volatile has been the commodity business or the Big Bird segments Looking into the next year three things I think are very important for us to identify and to monitor I think one is the competing proteinsAs we see by the USDA numbers released yesterday were expecting limited growth in the domestic availability of total protein in the United States being beef really down compared to yearoveryear And at a very expected high price which tends to favor chicken in promotional activities both in the retail and food service I think were also seeing a moderation in the high prices of grainAs we said we are having very favorable production especially on the corn side which should help our costs overall And also the promotional activity for the chicken both again in the retail and food service Also our operations have improved I think were lapping  the big problem that we have in staffing because of the pandemic All of our operations are now fully staffedWe still have a lot of operational improvements to capture based on training and based on full operations and better mix but I think that should help our operations next year So what we have is a scenario that is posing some headwinds for chicken overall Or tailwinds in terms of now what can change of course the economy can be different if the consumer has less available money to spend But on the overall chicken has been more resilient to even economic downturn scenariosOkay Perfect And then my second question I guess that one is for Matt Just coming back on the capital allocation side and you just said on the call to continue to invest in high returning projects et cetera Can you update us on what youre expecting full year CapEx to come out I mean obviously were yeartodate already almost at the levels we were in full year last year So is that run rate about 150 million for the fourth quarter should we expect that to come in as well And how do you think about CapEx into next year Is there a normalization Or you would still expect some elevated levelsYes Good question Ben We dealt in fourth quarter and look I think in total for the year well definitely be north of 550 million Our run rate should maybe slightly slow down as we wind down the Athens construction but we still will be finalizing our construction in our South Georgia facility which are two of the bigger strategic projects which weve been mentioning over the last yearSo the run rate that weve been having at kind of this 140 million probably pretty close to what I would see kind of going into the fourth quarter in full year north of 550 I think relative to next year I think what well do as we get through our budget process and our strategic focus here as we wind through our budgets here in the fourth quarter and meeting with our Board well be giving updates to you guys on that at our earnings call in FebruaryBut generally speaking we break this minute we dont have those larger strategic projects that have been initiated similar to the Athens and South Georgia protein conversion which would tell us to itd probably be down slightly for sure yearoveryearAnd also over the last two years Ben we invested heavily in automation as we have been talking about especially on the breast deboning automation And as we have the plants fully staffed of course were always looking to the payback of those projects but we dont expect significant investments in that scenarioOkay Thank you Congrats againThank you BenOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Incorporated Please go aheadYes Thanks so much Good morningHi Ben Good morning BenFabio I want to pick up on some comments you made just around the fourth quarter You noted that supply production levels are trending down through kind of most of the third quarter and it looks to be continuing into the fourth quarter based on the leading indicators You noted prices are at a historically average level but relative to grain prices seem unsustainably low In light of that and the demand backdrop that youve laid out do you think we could have a counter seasonal move in breast meat prices As we move through the quarter recognizing I know the prices are under pressure a bit to start the quarterYes Its a great point But usually Q4 is the lowest price for chicken because of all the events that we have Thanksgiving and Christmas is typically not the best sales moment for chicken as we have a lot of features on the other proteins I think starting midNovember and beginning of December what we usually see in our industry is a big increase in terms of demand because of the expectations for the beginning of the yearI think people talk about New Years resolution But I think its more after the Christmas and after New Year people go back to the normal buying patterns and chicken is an everyday item that is very important for our families So what we expect similar to prior years is a reduction in supply And were seeing as I mentioned that on the exits that are informed by USDAAnd were seeing a pickup in demand starting midNovember beginning of December and thats when we expect the prices to start increasing I think the volatility has been really strong on the breast meat If you look at the cut out therell be other parts where we are seeing a much better supply and demand scenario I think wings that was very low last year as it was priced out of the menu and many food servicesIts coming back to the menu So were seeing a steady increase in the price of wings Of course the wings season that just started also helps And were seeing as we mentioned steady improvement in the exports as the leg quarters from the United States are very competitively priced compared to all the other proteins available on the export scenario So when you think about the cutout were seeing more volatility on the breast meat but very well supported on leg quarters and on the wingsOkay Very good My second question is related to Mexico Another strong quarter there Can you provide any color on the goforward outlook for 4Q And then Hurricane Otis it doesnt look like you guys have operations where that made landfall and was most of the devastation was concentrated But do you expect that to have any impact on operations at allYes Sure On Mexico as we always mentioned It can be very volatile quarteroverquarter but we expect to be really strong yearoveryear and thats not different this year I think last year we saw a very strong first quarter and a very weak second quarter Of course that was based on some internal issues that we have on the live operationsFirst half and second half yesYes But this year what we are seeing is a strong demand for chicken As I mentioned I think the first semester and even Q3 which is not normal because what happens normally the seasonality in Mexico is that as schools are out people change their buying patterns and we see a weakness in the purchasing of chicken And as the school come back were seeing a lot of available income coming for school supplies and also an impact in demandBut this year has been different than other years and we see a very strong Q3 October September and October has always been the lowest levels of pricing in Mexico and that was not different This year but we are seeing prices already recovering There is always the competition of competing proteins and imports from both United States and Brazil impacting the demand in Mexico as well But I think that we are seeing a very favorable scenario coming in the next quarterYes And Ben just a couple of things to followup One is I could say also foreign currency volatility is something were currently always monitoring there in Mexico And your question relative to the storm my understanding the storm hit the  off coco area which does not its not an area that has a lot of production for us and it has now thankfully dissipated The storm is not nearly severe So were not seeing at this point any severe impacts to our operations at this timeOkay Great Thanks so muchThe next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Please go aheadHi Good morning Thanks for taking the questions My first one is on some of the operational improvements In the press release you alluded to on covering some incremental opportunities Can you elaborate a little bit on what those are And is there any way to quantify I guess the magnitude of those or the contributions of those improvements that youve realized so far this year and then the new ones going forwardSure Thank you for the question Andrew Yes every year in the budget time we identify the opportunities for operational improvements We call that opening the gaps And then also during the budgeting we created action plans to close those gaps and capture those operational improvement Typically we expect around 100 million to 200 million in improvements every year doing things to more efficiently capturing better yield better live operations and better mixSo last year was no different We identified a lot of operational improvements that we can take I think the biggest challenge was the staffing of our plants So we were not fully staffed It was ver, , ,0
288,ZIM Integrated: Getting Risky But Holding The Stock Is Still Justified,"Youve got to love ZIM Integrated Shipping  The company entered the US stock exchange two years ago at a timing that many companies would envy After the COVID19 pandemic container shipping rates had reached enormous levels leading the share price toToday however is a completely different story As you should already have noticed by now container shipping rates have plummeted as a result of lagging demand relative to the increasing supply of tonnage It is in this context that Im writing todays article about ZIMOn August 16th ZIM  their earnings for the second quarter of 2023 showing an EBIT loss of 147 million The company reported a total net loss figure of 213 million resulting to a negative EPS figure of 179 For the same period inIn addition container volume remained rather stagnant for the second quarter of 2023 while for the first six months of the year the company realized a slight decrease in carried container volume At the same time freight rates moved significantly lower reaching 1193 per TEU a drop of 67 compared to the same period in 2022For the full year 2023 the company anticipates an EBIT loss of 100 to 500 million and adjusted EBITDA of 12 to 16 million For perspective for Q1 2023 EBIT loss was 14 million which added to the 147 million of Q2 2023 brings us to the upper half of the EBIT loss guidance However clearly the outlier figure is the 14 million EBIT loss recorded in Q1 2023 as the next quarters will likely be much worse despite the fact that traditionally they are the strongest ones So this brings us rather to the lower end of the EBIT loss guidance spectrum closer to 500 millionDuring the companys Q2 2023  I was very glad to hear that from a total of 148 vessels the company operates 16 car carriers The reason is that this particular segment offers some very appealing economics due to the shortage of carriers and the abundance of shipping demand Already some car carrier operating companies are planning to  their fees charged to their customers due to the high charter prices of these vessels reaching 110k per day for 65k CEU vesselsRegarding the traditional container shipping business due to the freight rate collapse the company is moving into larger and more modern vessels in an attempt to exploit economies of scale and cut down on operating costs In ZIM they are expecting to get their hands on 38 newbuilt vessels in the next 18 months while 47 of their current vessels will reach their charter contract expiration during the same period So in 15 years time the company will be operating a much more modern and cost efficient fleet also containing LNG powered vesselsHowever container supply and demand fundamentals are ruthless at this point On a global basis container tonnage is expected to grow during the next year as well while GDP growth prospects arent exactly stellarAs we can see in the table listed below the global economy is going for a slowdown to say the least while expected container volume growth is anticipated to be negative This situation is going to continue to put pressure on ZIM as with the exception of new vessels their average charter time remaining is 246 monthsIf it wasnt for their strong cash position I believe ZIM would be in serious trouble right now However the company ended the second quarter of 2023 with total cash  of 32 billion The problem is that during this quarter the company burnt just above 1 billion At the  ZIM had 425 billion in total cash and cash equivalents etc The cash burn between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 was 353 million As you read before tonnage supply will outgrow shipping demand at least until the first half of 2024 So one can realize that if the next few quarters are going to be just as bad ZIM could potentially face a liquidity problemIt is no coincidence that their net leverage ratio increased fivefold from 01x to 05x in just one quarter Moreover if this metric is calculated on a TTM basis as newer and lower EBITDA figures are inserted into the calculation we can expect a significant rise in net leverage ratio For example assuming that the companys net debt remains steady at 16 billion and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 lands at 14 billion guidance middle point we get a net leverage ratio of 11x But net debt will not remain the same in my view I believe it will rise as the company burns cash So the net leverage ratio is expected to be even higherI dont know if you have realized it already but if you havent Ill put it plain and simple ZIM is not going to pay a dividend in the third quarter of 2023 Neither will it pay one in the fourth quarter of 2024 in my view I sincerely doubt that they will pay a dividend during the first half of 2024 either However at this low price point I wouldnt sell my shares Instead I would generate income by writing covered calls against these shares while at the same time keeping an eye on the next few quarters I have every reason to believe that the market has discounted the worst case scenario for the company so thats why I consider ZIM as a Hold  This article was written for information purposes only You should not in any case take the contents of this article to be an urge to buy hold or sell securities Always perform your own research before investing in the stock market

289,W. P. Carey Is Fairly Valued: No Margin Of Safety,The economics of REITs as an asset class is influenced by two cycles There is the space market cycle which has to do with the supply and demand for a particular type of space For a saleleaseback specialist such  W P Carey is a spread investor W P Carey acquires a companys real estate and then leases it back to them on a longterm triplenet basis To finance the purchase of the real estate they access debt and equity markets at a lower cost than the rental revenue they earn from the leaseback The tenant takes care of substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property including real estate taxes and property insurance W P Carey simply collects rent and profits from the spread between the rental income earned and the cost of the capital used to acquire the real estateFor a REIT this spread can be calculated as the difference between the capitalization rate or cap rate and the cost of capital The cap rate is the net operating income divided by the value of the assets and the cost of capital can be decomposed into the cost of debt the cost of equity and the relative weights of each form of capital employed in the businessLet us first estimate the cap ratePlease take a look at Table 1 for the implied capitalization rate for the Diversified REIT sector for the last seven quartersThere has been a steady upward trend in cap rates for the diversified REIT sector If we take the average of the two recent quarters we arrive at average cap rate for the current half year at 754 To this estimate we should probably consider some adjustments WP Carey has meaningful exposure to Europe and cap rates have not yet shown the same trajectory in Europe as they have in the US In the  the CEO echoed similar sentiments and remarked that transactions in the first half of the year were executed at a cap rate of 73 We shall use this cap rate for our analysisFor W P Carey to earn economic profit their cost of capital must be less than 73 Let us now turn our attention to the cost of capital for W P CareyIn order to calculate the cost of capital we have to calculate the cost of debt the cost of equity and scale each cost to the extent they are used in the business Let us review the capital structure to see how much debt versus equity is being employed by WP Carey Please take a look at Table 2Now that we have the relative weights we now look at each source of capital and estimate the cost Please take a look at Table 3 for the cost of equity There are different methods and philosophies around calculating the cost of equity We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM in which we essentially add a spread to the riskfree rate and scale the spread by the volatility of a particular stockThe beta statistic measures the volatility with respect to the market The beta is 079 implies that WP Careys stock is less sensitive than the market Conceptually this is justified since WP Careys revenue stream is secured by counterparties that are often investment grade tenants It is for this reason that triplenet lease REITs are sometimes considered bondlike investments and are frequently classified as a defensive holding Moving on to the next statistic the riskfree rate I use the 10year Treasury which is a frequently used proxy for the riskfree rate The last input is the equity risk of 440  reflecting the most recent monthly data coming from  This is well within the historic range The cost of equity arrived at using this approach is 776 Now that we have a cost of equity let us now estimate the cost of debt Please take look at Table 4 in which we provide the issuer rating for WP Carey and the median yield for similarly situated fixedincome investmentsThe implication of the cost of debt is that should W P Carey wish to secure or refinance debt at about the 10year tenor it would be facing a cost of debt of 575 This does not mean that their interest expense is going to be exactly 575 of their longterm debt because fixedrate debt could have originated at a different time when interest rates were lower In general businesses will be slow to refinance debt in an inflationary environment to take advantage of previous interest rate regimes and will be quick to refinance debt in a declining interest rate environment to take advantage of lower available interest rates Because of this the actual cost of debt will be less Nevertheless WP Carey has a 245 due February 2032 priced at 7725 that exchanged hands at a  on September 8 The issue is callable so that would lend support to our 575 estimateNow that we have a cost of debt the cost of equity and the weights of each in the capital structure we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital Please take a look at Table 5The tax shield normally included in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital is ignored because REITs generally do not pay taxes at the corporate level Additionally W P Carey does not have any preferred shares outstandingIn Table 6 we quantify the amount of the value that is created by W P Carey by subtracting the cost of capital from the cap rateIn the current macroeconomic environment W P Carey is able to generate value to the tune of 30 basis pointsA REIT creating value is only part of the picture While it is necessary condition for a potential investment it isnt a sufficient one We also have to ask to whom does that value accrue to Fixed income holders Management Equity investors As equity investors with minority interests we want to make sure that at least some of that value created shows up in our accountTo estimate how much value is created on behalf on equity investors we will revisit the cost of equity calculated previouslyWe estimated the cost of equity using CAPM which is a statistical way of ascertaining the cost of equity There are other methods to estimate the cost of equity Also cost of equity is the terminology used from the companys perspective It is the  for them to obtain  capital From the investors point of view the cost of equity is the required rate of return for an investment And for many investors particularly REIT investors the required rate of return has two components the current dividend yield and the growth rate of the dividendsPlease take a look at Table 7 where we look at the total return as the current dividend yield plus fiveyear growth rate as supplied by Seeking AlphaIn the next Table we compare the total return just presented to the cost of equity presented in an earlier tableWe can see from Table 8 that there is currently a negative value of three basis points Had there been a minimal  difference that would not have changed the investment picture You want to see a wide positive difference as a signal that there is an adequate margin of safety in the investment An adequate margin of safety is important in an analysis like this in which a small change in one variable can exert a meaningful difference in the resultsA second takeaway from the foregoing might be that the stock appears efficiently priced by the marketThe spread between the cap rate and cost of capital is positive and a welcome sign for W P Carey in particular and probably other REITs in the diversified sector as well While W P Carey creates value as a business an investment in the equity is not as compelling The cost of equity estimated using CAPM can be thought of as an opportunity cost and the total return that can be obtained at todays price does not meet the opportunity cost hurdle There are factors that can change this investment picture The factors that can change the investment picture that are beyond managements control include changes to the riskfree rate and the equity risk premium The factors that can change the picture that is within managements sphere of influence include the value of dividends paid per share and the rate of growth of the dividends Of the two a modest increase in the dividend growth rate would be a welcome development   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is

290,"Wall Street Bulls And Bears, A Macro Review","Investors often get caught up in the daytoday weektoweek market action and often let the MACRO longterm view get confused with what happened yesterday orThe MACRO view captures more of the fundamental backdrop and as we know the market can and often does diverge from what that might be telling us In the near term sentiment can overreach boundaries to both the upside and downside Over time it is the MACRO scene that eventually wins out and that is why its important to always have that view embedded in anAs regular readers of my missives are aware since early 2022 I saw the emergence of the BEAR market that eventually took the SP to a 19 loss by yearend 22 Since Q3 22 there were numerous calls for a very bumpy ride for both the economy and the market as investors navigated the Feds rate hiking cycle and high inflation backdrop In essence I was not among those that were calling for a soft landing Instead my view was that a recession was inevitable in 23Despite the soft economic data being reported and many indicators pointing to recession I was fortunate to spot the change in the market price action in May and saw confirmation of a BEAR to BULL reversal in June and now more confirmation in July Price as it always does was the deciding factor that outweighed the poor fundamental backdrop that still exists todayThe bottom line By using market action by following the MACRO longterm technical view we were able to spot the BEAR market in February 22 and now the reversal to a BULL market in June of 23Analysts and economists can point to a myriad of reasons why the market has not followed the MACRO fundamentals but I will highlight the TWO that had the most impactNow lets switch back to the  MACRO view First well speak to the   then to the  The reality is that we are still navigating several confusing crosscurrents in the economyWith two negative GDP prints in the first half of 2022 many including myself believed the recession was here and in my view the Stock market dropping into a BAER trend confirmed that Since then weve watched GDP climb 26 in Q4 22 20 in Q1 23 and 24 in Q2 Clearly the economy is more robust than most believed it would be Economists  including those at the Fed  are quickly abandoning their recession forecasts and concluding that the Fed may have successfully pulled off a soft landing But while GDP growth in recent quarters appears solid the economy is not nearly as robust as the headline data suggest2Q23 GDP growth 24 quarteroverquarter annualized is not as robust as the headline number indicates Personal Consumption Expenditure PCE contribution to GDP growth slowed from 279 in Q1 to just 112 in Q2 Recall that PCE is not only about 70 of GDP but it is also the most stable component of GDPOther data points are also worth mentioning Weve already discussed the fact that while GDP Gross domestic product is increasing GDI Gross Domestic Income is decliningGDI counts what all participants make from the sale of what is produced ie wages profits taxesConsider the following In Q4 22 GDP  26 GDI  by 33 In Q1 23 GDP  20 GDI  by 18 One measure says the economy is expanding at a reasonably robust pace The other says that the economy was in a recession earlier this yearIf we look for other clues about how good or bad this economy is going the picture remains foggy Weve seen the Leading Economic Indicators fall for 15 straight monthsHowever the Conference Board also publishes the index of coincident indicators which consists of four economic indicators each of which rises or falls roughly coincident with the overall pace of economic activity One such indicator is payroll employment which has been climbing rapidly and is contributing positively to the overall index Another coincident indicator is industrial production which has declined slightly in recent months and countered some of the strength contributed by employment As a result this measure of current economic activity has been essentially unchanged for the past six months which seems roughly consistent with the average of the GDP and GDP data and why this poststimulus fundamental scene has been a nightmare to figure out The norecession camp has consistently to their credit said the steady gains in employment confirm that the economy is not in or headed for a recession Equally important the surprisingly large declines in GDI suggest that the economy is not nearly as robust as the GDP data indicate Thus the Feds decision to let the data guide them about what to do next seems warrantedThe irony is IF the economy is as strong as the GDP data suggest inflation is going to be very stubborn and remain above 23 Steady growth at those levels will soon begin to push inflation higher and force the Fed to raise rates further to cool things down Investors are euphoric by the recent slowdown in inflation but the euphoria may be shortlived Increasing Energy prices may also be another factor that supports stubborn inflationThe Blue Chip Consensus increased its Q3 GDP estimate from 06 to 04 but reduced its estimate for Q4 from 01 to 01 For Q1 24 the consensus is 04 Q2 at 09 Q3 at 16 and Q4 at 19 At the very least these forecasts align with what I have believed for a while However its not aligned with what the stock market is saying and that suggests this situation could change once again That leaves investors with a scene where economic growth is in such flux that anything can happen and that If you arent thoroughly confused by this investing scene allow me to toss this tidbit in as well Before I do let me remind you again that despite the nearterm fundamental mess The SAVVY Investor strategy will follow the Just like everyone has a nose everyone has an opinion on what happens next with this economy Lets try to stay with an OPEN mind while looking at the FACTS No matter what your opinion is I believe we have to recognize what we are facing At is a STRETCH to believe is going to have  on the economy down the road Thats just not feasible nor is it a HIGH probability of occurringThe downgrade of the US credit rating started a renewed conversation on a serious issueThe US is now paying a record 663 billion in debt in 23 That interest is expected to grow exponentially to a point where 1 trillion a year in interest payments will be the normStay tunedAfter the SP 500s threeweek winning streak came to an end investors entered the scene on Monday in a riskonbuying mood Buying was concentrated in the Industrials Financials Turnaround Tuesday arrived with a massive riskoff vibe across global markets that bled over to the US scene The US Dollar moved higher Treasuries lower and crude oil traded down as the US markets openedThe gloom was driven by concerns over Chinese growth poor trade data and Moodys downgrade of US banks If that wasnt enough Italy went into attack mode when Poor sessions on Wednesday and Thursday had the BEARS celebrating their dominance as they sent all of the indices down for the second straight day Friday turned into a mixed session that left the SP with a loss for the week making it backtoback weekly losses It was the same for the NASDAQ Composite  while the DJIA rallied and posted a modest gain for the week was largely as expected and the generally benign report rallied bonds and stocks as the report saw Fed funds futures further pare risks for a rate hike next month Implied rates now suggest less than 10 chance for a September tightening down from about 12 And the probability of a November boost has fallen to about 26 from about 33However Powells July super core measure edged up to 02 from unchanged and rose to 41 yy from 40 yy and that should give investors pause rose 03 in July on both the headline and core  These follow Junes unchanged headline For the headline There will be another inflation report before the next Fed meeting In my view the door for another increase remains wide open dipped to 712 in the August preliminary report after climbing to 716 in July from 644 in June Sentiment has improved from the record low 500 print from June 2022 and is near the best since October 2021 But it is still well off of the cycle high of 883 from April 2021 The weakness was in the  component which fell to 673 from 683 previouslyWhen the cart comes before the horse there is rarely any forward movement Thats what we have seen in the transition to EVs The cart is here but the horse in the form of charging stations and overall convenience hasnt been delivered According to automotive research firm Cox Automotive  thats a 342 increase from a year ago when only about 21000 did so At the current pace of sales it would take 92 days for dealerships to sell all their electric vehiclesWhats worse many models are now selling below MSRP Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price adding to the losses that are already Im not sure we have ever experienced anything like this Rush to produce a product that will lose billions as its manufactured Ill simply ask how is that not a negative for the economyWhen we open this can of worms we discover a lot more than what is being told In the entrypriced segment  at around 978 per 100 miles Entrypriced EVs charged mostly at home cost 1255 while those charged at commercial stations reach 1597 costing approximately 1108 per 100 miles This is lower than the cost for primarily home EV charging 1262 and for mostly commercial EV charging 1610Its not until we get to the luxury segment the EVs most cant afford and be employed do we finally see a shift in favor of electric vehicles and there are still issues Highend EV drivers charged mostly at home paid around 1350 per 100 miles compared to 1756 for a comparable ICE car Luxury EV drivers Eventually EVs  become more economical than gaspowered cars but then there are the inevitable problems with the power grid that is still powered by fossil fuels I emphasized the word may because  Does anyone believe rates  as demand rises So Ill ask another question what is the advantage of this RUSH to electric And reiterate the initial concern How is this entire transition not going to impact the economy negativelyIll stand by what I have stated since the initial phases to go electric were initiated This will be the biggest boondoggle ever imposed on any economy in the history of civilization if these mandates arent scrapped quickly The negative economic impact could be enormous  Common sense may be entering the scene Ford reported secondquarter earnings that revealed widening losses in its electric vehicles unit That coincidentally prompted CEO Jim Farley to say Youre going to see a lot more hybrid systems from usIts a first step that follows the lead of Toyota They saw the handwriting on the wall keeping their hybrid line intact and were roundly criticized when they announced that strategy In my view they had it right from the beginningPerhaps the laws of supply and DEMAND will be allowed to play out instead of MANDATING a change that clearly is NOT ready for prime timeThe aforementioned announcement of a 40 windfall profits on their Banks is another example of a ball and chain being placed on capitalism The government wants to use the proceeds from the tax to help those struggling with the cost of living Weve seen how the  have backfired here in the USTheir strong financial system was part of the reason for helping prop up Italys economy as GDP growth came in above forecasts recently Punishing a business that is running successfully producing profits and adding to GDP growth is a recipe for general economic disaster While Italy calls itself a capitalist country with this announcement socialism has entered the scene That keeps the MACRO analysis questioning the prospects for global growth and keeping the forecast at lowsThe pullback from the July 28th closing high picked up momentum this week It wasnt until the SP hit a key support level did we see buyers come inDuring these reversion trades it becomes a question of whether the SP can bounce from here or break lower opening the door for further weakness Its not uncommon for an index to retreat back to the breakout level and for the SP that would target the 4200 range But that came to an end recently as the SP 500 recently ended its streak of overbought daily closes at 45 trading days dating back to the Friday before Memorial Day That was the longest streak since September 2020 and the 23rd time that it closed at overbought levels for 40 or more trading daysWeve noted this multiple times but its worth repeating while the market is due for a pullback these types of streaks occur in BULL markets and by definition Bull markets are periods of aboveaverage returnsBespoke Investment GroupWhile the SP 500 pulled back from overbought levels this week it remains well above its intermediateterm support levels and the uptrends off the October lows remain firmly intact This creates a doubleedged sword On the one hand the market hasnt shown any signs of technical deterioration but on the other theres still downside potential before solid support levels are even testedThe breakout levels for the SP 500 DJIA and the NASDAQ 100 have been easily identified After long uninterrupted rallies its not uncommon for breakout levels to be tested These levels The big news recently was a sudden increase in longterm Treasury yields as the 10year yield increased from 397 up to 420 on August 3rd before settling at 415 on Friday That leaves the 10year uncomfortably close to the October 2022 closing highs of 424 For the moment resistance has held and what happens next in rates could determine where the stock market trades in the next few weeksI cant tell you where the market will be at the end of next week or the end of August and a little gut check to keep the bulls honest is always on the table but the picture between now and yearend still looks positive There are different patterns on display for different indices and sectors but they all have ONE thing in common the intermediate and longterm trends are UPThat should remain in the back of our minds as we now go thru what is the first real challenge to this 2023 rallyGiven the choppy action in the market this week the smallcap Index  trades sideways after another failed attempt at a key resistance level Since the November 21 high it has been a series of LOWER highs for the small caps History tells us the Russell 2000 small caps are a good predictor for the US economy This price action adds to the argument that the US economy is not on a solid growth trajectory and there could be trouble aheadSix weeks into the third quarter and the Q3 game plan is working to perfection Laggards are now winners and the Leaders have pulled back A subtle shift to Value from Growth is underway I suspect this could start to balance the scales and leave some investors wondering why they may have worn out their welcome in the HOT momentum tech tradesThe Energy ETF  continues to show strength as it cleared the MarchApril highs With a decisive close 89 above those levels 87 the stage is set for a run at alltime highs 94 In addition all of the energy subsectors have rallied nicely They are overbought in the short term but the underlying trends suggest dips should be boughtThe Oil service sector  pulled for a day back after making a new high then followed up with another new high later in the week It is due for a pullback but if I am correct about the longterm prospects of this area of the market it could only be getting started After a slow start the subsector is up 14 for the yearMany individual stocks in this group are extended however they are BUYS on dipsThe group was a big part of the Q3 strategy forecast and its working out nicely WTI has strung together a sevenweek winning streak on its trip to a close above 83 on Friday The rally has taken out both the 50Day moving average and 200DMA after prices consolidated almost the entire year While the move higher in prices has been dramatic it has come with tighter physical marketsRefined product prices are starting to firm as well wholesale gasoline futures trade at the highest levels since October while diesel futures are trading at the highest levels since January Thats thanks to both the move higher in crude oil prices and higher refining margins per barrel Gasoline premiums over crude are around 45 while diesel margins are around 90 a level unheard of before the invasion of Ukraine That bodes well for the refiners Valero  and Marathon Petroleum  are the goto names in that groupIve highlighted the reasons why crude supply can stay constrained and with the Saudis in control of pricing they will do what is best for  and that keeps prices elevated On the negative side while we arent there yet Energy costs may once again become a problem for the US economy High energy prices will keep inflation elevated If it does Energy stocks will once again become a  in the general market I see no reason to lower exposure to the groupAfter two months of sideways action in a trading range the Nat Gas ETF  broke to the upside In typical fashion this volatile commodity gave most of that gain right back on the following day I continue to HOLD my position for the long termThe Financials  were humming along holding onto support until Moodys downgrade of the banking system came along It wasnt able to hold on to nearterm support and looks destined to test the July breakout levelsThe weak action now has the longterm tend back in question this group might be another tell on where the general market goes nextCommodity prices more broadly have also started to trend higher off the early summer lows As shown below the Refinitiv CRB Commodity Index has quietly rallied nearly 10The GOLD ETF breaks down once again and is back at the lower end of the trading range Instead of challenging the old highs GLD will be testing supportSILVER  also completely broke down this week Ive been aggressively trading the ETF taking quick gains when available while maintaining the CORE position This weakness has me pondering adding another LONG tradeURANIUM  has been the bright spot recently It rallied nicely in July and is tantalizing close to an upside breakout My last trade was at a support level and Im still hopeful the ETF can break past minor resistance and add more gains to a profitable trade I do like the look of this chart patternThe group  remains locked in a trading range between 120140 The sector was more stable than the rest of the market recently as the ETF is now closer to the upper band of that trading range closing at 136 on FridayThe Bitotechs  are on a roller coaster ride that has this group testing support Higher interest rates continue to be an overhang on a group of stocks that is capital intensiveA pullback was in order and the NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ 100 both broke initial support levels before stabilizing at secondary support Since the July 19th interim high on the NASDAQ weve seen a series of LOWER highs While the entire Tech sector seems stable now I wouldnt rule out more weaknesses ahead The trade is now towards value and I can see that continue for a while longer More tech stocks have broken first support and that is the first sign that more choppy sideways action is aheadComing into the earnings season Semiconductors were set up for perfection While the reports have generally been OK it was time for this rally to slow and that is what has occurred The intermediate trend is UP but the shortterm scene looks toppyThe alltime high is about 11 away and the breakout that started this rally is 12 lower It remains a question as to what will come first A deeper pullback for this group would not be surprisingA stop pause a moment of digestion whatever we wish to call it this price weakness was overdue The SP approached the neutral zone quickly and while there is plenty of room for further price normalization I note the internals show signs of quickly approaching oversold territory which tells me that there is more weakness underneath the surface over the last two weeks than the simple price charts are showingForget about the negative headlines that came across during the week they had little to do with the price action What we are witnessing is a good oldfashioned mean reversion in sentiment after an impressive run in stocks this yearIts safe to say we have entered a  and that means stocks that have rallied the most will at best be trading sideways for a while The easy money has been made Stock selection and entry points will be more important

291,Jackson Hole - The Future Of Inflation And Interest Rates,Jerome Powell  about the past present and future path of inflation and interest rates Here are some highlights and general conclusions from his remarksThese were very honest and measured remarks I thought they were wellbalanced and as objective as they could be I especially like the emphasis on the causes of inflation and the ways in which Monetary Policy is working even if its not working as quickly as theyd likeI also especially liked the risk management approach here Wed like to think of the Fed as an omnipotent entity with perfect foresight but the reality is that theyre guessing just like the rest of us And while that might be an uncomfortable view it is the reality of navigating the economy and marketsWe all have to make educated guesses about whats going to happen and an important part of good risk management is understanding what go wrong even if you dont things to go wrongthe broad conclusion from all of this is that interest rates are likely to stay higher for longer This is a tough situation for the Fed Inflation has come down meaningfully but remains too highThis creates what Ive described as a bimodal distributional outcome here and its part of what makes the Feds job so difficult In simple terms the longer the Fed remains tight the longer they grind credit markets And that creates more and more default risk across time as firms and households have to roll old debts into new higher interest rate debtThis creates a highly asymmetric risk in credit markets where economic slowdown defaults and deflation could eventually put significant downward pressure on markets and the economyAt the same time the Fed needs to stay tight in order to ensure that inflation is under control But if they stay tight for too long they could exacerbate that credit market risk Which will happen Its cloudy to be sureThis is both good and bad for markets as a whole As Ive emphasized more recently all of this is great for shortterm investors who just want to clip a real return in TBills at 55 But it creates a good deal of uncertainty across anything that is longer durationLong duration corporate credit and equity are especially at risk here Although our base case remains modest economic expansion that bimodal distribution creates a smaller but asymmetric risk where longer duration instruments continue to generate meager riskadjusted returns consistent with the performance of the last two years the SP 500 is up 1 over 24 months with a standard deviation of 20  not greatAn outlier credit event isnt our base view but the current rate position makes that a meaningfully higher risk than it otherwise would be And that warrants caution not because we expect it to happen but because we have to hedge that risk in case the Fed is wrongThis remains an incredibly confusing period in economic history and describing it as cloudy might be an understatement The solution to this in our view is to optimize certainty by establishing clear time horizons across portfoliosAs our Defined Duration strategy emphasizes investors should have a specific understanding of time within their portfolio so that these matters do not unduly influence behaviorHave a great weekend The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,26,2023-08-25,0
292,BGR: Economic Laws Make The Case For This Energy CEF,"A few days ago we discussed the BlackRock Resources  Commodities Strategy Trust  which is a closedend fund that invests in a combination of energy stocks mining stocks and other stocks that are poised to benefit from risingWe last discussed this fund in our service back in September The funds share price is down slightly since that time as its share price declined from 1314 to 1295 per share However the distribution received offsets about half of that decline The funds performance over a longer period of time has been much more promising We last  this fund on the public site on May 22 2023 Since that time the fund has significantly beaten the SP 500 Index This is partly due to the change in market conditions since that time During the first half of this year the headline inflation rate was falling rapidly and many market participants and politicians were inclined to call the Federal Reserves fight against inflation a victory As such there was a great deal of optimism that interest rates would eventually be reduced and we would get back to the bubble market environment in no time However as I  that improvement in inflation was almost entirely caused by the Federal Government flooding the economy with crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Now that the Reserve is in tankbottom condition that is no longer an option In the absence of this extra oil the balance between supply and demand for crude oil is extremely tight and energy prices have been trending up since July That reversed the optimism about the progress that has been made against inflation causing the SP 500 Index to start declining as it now looks likely that high rates will be with us for a very long time As energy prices have been slowly trending upward this fund has outperformed the broader market indexAs we will discuss in this article the fundamentals for energy prices continue to remain strong which should benefit this fund over the next few years As such it may be a good idea to obtain some energy sector exposure in your portfolio and this fund offers an easy way to do itAccording to the funds  the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of total return This objective makes a great deal of sense considering that the fund invests primarily in common equities As we can see here fully 9853 of the funds total assets are invested in common stocks Its only other asset is a rather small cash positionThis is in line with the websites description of the funds objectives and strategyAs I have explained in numerous previous articles total return makes sense as a primary objective for any fund that invests primarily in equity securities After all common stocks are by their very nature total return vehicles This is why investors purchase them with the intention of receiving an income from the dividends that they pay out as well as benefiting from the capital gains that should accompany the growth and prosperity of the issuing company This differs from a fixedincome fund which will generally have limited capital gains potential and deliver most of its total return in the form of direct payments to the investorsThe energy industry as a whole is well known for paying out much higher yields than other sectors After all as of the time of writing the Alerian MLP Index  yields 691 which is actually one of the lowest yields that this index has had in many years The iShares US Energy ETF  currently yields 291 and the iShares Global Energy ETF  yields 439 as of the time of writing Admittedly all of these yields are less than we have seen for quite some time but they are still better than most other sectors For example the iShares US Healthcare ETF  only yields 121 and the iShares US Technology ETF  yields 037 at the current price Thus dividend income is likely to make up a greater proportion of the total returns for an energy fund like this one than it would for a fund that invests in a different sectorThere is a very big reason for this The energy sector in general came under a lot of fire from investors for the subpar returns that it delivered over the decade prior to the coronavirus pandemic From January 1 2010 until January 1 2020 the iShares US Energy ETF underperformed the SP 500 Index by a lotThis is despite the massive increase in production that US shale producers delivered over the period We can see that the big problem is that the energy sector in general never recovered from the crash in 2015 when Saudi Arabia was attempting to destroy the shale industry This is partly due to the fact that energy prices never really recovered from that incident This chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil over that periodInvestors were naturally upset by this poor performance compared to everything else so the energy industry came up with a solution Basically many companies decided to simply pay out the majority of their free cash flows to the investors as share buybacks and dividends They generally eschewed investing in production growth even when energy prices skyrocketed in 2021 and 2022 This did result in some of these companies having dividend yields in excess of 10 though so investors in these companies did fine over the years since the pandemic even as every other sector was crashing in 2022Unfortunately the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trusts largest positions are not in those companies that sported abnormally high dividend yields during 2022s energy price boom Here are the largest positions in the fundHere are the dividend yields for each of these companiesAdmittedly none of these companies have the jawdropping yields that we occasionally see in US shale plays or midstream companies but TotalEnergies and BP are not really too bad in terms of yield All of them boast significantly higher yields than we see in many other sectors however For example all of these companies except for Cheniere Energy have a higher yield than the SP 500 Index By themselves though none of these companies has a high enough yield to justify investing in the fund in the absence of capital gains After all if the yield was all we got we would be better off just sitting in a 5yielding money market fundFortunately all of these companies are positioned to see their net incomes and cash flow surge over the coming years One of the big reasons for this can be found in the discussion that we just had about the poor performance of the energy sector since the oil price crash in 2014As a result of that price crash energy companies around the world tightened their belts considerably Longtime readers may recall that I published a few articles around that time specifically pointing out that cuts to exploration and development activities would hinder growth prospects across the industry That proved to be correct and unfortunately prices never recovered enough for investment to return to its previous levels As a result we now have a situation where the industry has underinvested in production capacity for almost a decade However the global demand for crude oil has not declined The pandemic did result in a temporary blip but total global oil consumption has been steadily increasingThis is expected to increase going forward with most independent energy analytics firms projecting that total consumption will be somewhere between 105 to 110 million barrels per day in 2030 Due to the underinvestment in energy production over the past several years it is unlikely that global crude oil production will actually be at that level One of the characteristics of oil fields is that their production output declines over time Thus without sufficient new capacity coming online production will go down That is the scenario that is currently being projected to occur Analysts at JPMorgan Commodities recently predicted that the world will have a 11 million barrel shortage of crude oil by 2025 and a 71 million barrel shortage by 2030I do not have to explain what that will do to energy prices as the basic economic law of supply and demand makes that case for me As we have seen over the past few months the stocks held by this fund tend to appreciate when energy prices rise as does the fund itselfThus the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust appears to be very wellpositioned to deliver both a very attractive yield and share price gains to its investors going forwardAs mentioned earlier the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of total return However as is the case with most closedend funds the funds basic business model is to maintain a relatively stable level of net assets and pay out most to all of its investment returns to investors When we consider the total returns that are available both through capital gains and dividends we can probably expect that this fund would have a reasonably high distribution yieldThat is indeed the case as the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust pays a monthly distribution of 00657 per share 7884 per share annually which gives it a 609 yield at the current price This is not nearly as high as the yield that we can obtain from a fixedincome fund or similar but the current yield is a direct result of the share price appreciation that the fund has benefited from over the past few months pushing down its yield Unfortunately the fund has not been particularly consistent with respect to the distribution that it pays outAs we can clearly see the funds distribution has varied quite a bit over the years This seems likely to reduce the funds appeal in the eyes of those investors who are seeking a safe and secure source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles This is not really the best use of this fund though as our overall thesis here is that the fund works as a play on rising energy prices As we can see above the distribution cuts have generally occurred during periods in which energy prices were declining The fund has been steadily increasing its payout over the past two years as energy prices have gone up and companies in the sector have started to give higher returns For example we can see here that it raised its distribution earlier this yearIt seems logical that the fund will continue to increase its distribution as our thesis plays out and higher energy prices allow the companies held in the funds portfolio to enjoy higher valuationsAs is always the case we want to investigate how well the fund is covering its distribution After all we do not want the fund to be overdistributing and drawing down its asset base unnecessarily This will not work very well in the long term for obvious reasonsFortunately we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis As of the time of writing the funds most recent  corresponds to the sixmonth period that ended on June 30 2023 This is nice as it covers the first half of this year As mentioned earlier in the article this is a period in which the Federal Government was artificially suppressing the price of crude oil by draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve As such the price of crude oil during this period was lower than we saw over much of 2022 which naturally had an adverse impact on the performance of the companies that are held by the fund The funds ability to handle this situation and deliver solid returns will speak well of its overall quality of management and of course the better managements ability to generate returns during that environment the better it should perform during a period of rising energy prices as we are likely to see going forwardDuring the sixmonth period the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust received 8126851 in dividends from the assets in its portfolio The fund had to pay foreign withholding taxes on some of this which reduced its total investment income to 7731316 over the period The fund paid its expenses out of this amount which left it with 5682231 available for shareholders This was unfortunately not nearly enough to cover the 10606571 that the fund actually paid out in distributions over the period That is likely to be concerning at first glance as the fund clearly failed to fully cover its distribution out of net investment incomeHowever the fund has other methods through which it can obtain money to use to cover the distribution For example it might have had some capital gains that could be paid out In addition this fund occasionally writes options in an attempt to generate premium income that acts like a synthetic dividend for the stocks that it owns Neither one of these things is included in the net investment income but they obviously represent money coming into the fund Fortunately the fund did enjoy some success here as it reported net realized gains of 18132696 but these were offset by 28865010 net unrealized losses Overall the funds net assets declined by 18450086 during the period after accounting for all inflows and outflowsDespite the fact that net assets went down during the period the funds distribution does appear to be quite reasonably covered One reason for this is that the funds distribution was less than its net investment income plus net realized gains The only reason for the decline in net assets was the net unrealized losses but these can very easily be reversed the second the market becomes stronger When we consider that the energy sector in general did start trending up around midJuly it is quite possible that some of these losses are not losses anymoreSecondly the funds net assets are still up over the trailing eighteenmonth period Over the fullyear 2022 period the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust saw its net assets increase by 84989114 after accounting for all inflows and outflows that it experienced over the period Thus the decline in net assets that the fund saw during the most recent period only partially offset that Overall the funds finances seem to be in good shape and we should not have to worry about too much hereAs of October 12 2023 the most recent date for which data is currently available the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust has a net asset value of 1465 per share but the funds shares only trade for 1295 each This gives the funds shares a whopping 1160 discount on net asset value at the current price This is a very attractive discount that is relatively in line with the 1172 discount that the shares have averaged over the past month As I have pointed out numerous times before anytime that a closedend fund obtains a doubledigit discount it generally represents a good entry point unless the funds finances are distressed That is clearly not the case here so the current price is more than acceptable to buy the funds sharesIn conclusion the BlackRock Energy  Resources Trust is a very solid closedend fund that is wellpositioned to profit from any increase in crude oil prices That is quite likely to happen considering that it looks highly likely that the world will suffer from a shortage of this necessary commodity over the next several years As such the fund may make a lot of sense right now as a way to obtain a 609 yield that is likely to increase going forward The fund is having no trouble covering its distribution and it is currently trading at an incredibly attractive valuation so there is no reason not to pick up some shares hereEditors Note This article discusses one or more

293,"TotalEnergies: Energy Prices And Russia Drag On Earnings, But Still Decent Company","On Thursday October 26 2023 European energy supermajor TotalEnergies SE   its third quarter 2023 earnings results At first glance these results were mixed as TotalEnergies managed to beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of revenueThe fact that TotalEnergies revenues went down yearoveryear is not necessarily anything that we need to worry about After all it was certainly not the only energy company to have experienced such a phenomenon with respect to its results Exxon Mobil  which also reported lastAs longtime readers are no doubt well aware it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a companys earnings results before delving into an analysis of its results This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis Therefore here are the highlights from TotalEnergies thirdquarter 2023 earnings resultsIt seems essentially certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights will notice is that many measures of TotalEnergies financial performance came in weaker during the third quarter of 2023 than they did during the equivalent quarter of last year One of the biggest reasons for this is that energy prices were lower on average during the most recent quarter than they were during the third quarter of last year We can see this quite clearly hereWe can see that the price of oil did finally start to rise during this quarter following several months of suppression partly caused by the United States Federal Government flooding the market from oil using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Basically as I  earlier this year the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia made the decision to cut crude oil production in order to keep the balance between supply and demand very tight In effect what these cuts were intended to do was offset the impact of the sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve The cuts remain in this place to this day yet the Federal Government stopped selling oil from its stockpile back in midJuly As of right now there are 351274 million barrels of crude oil in the nations storage which is the lowest level that has been seen since the early 1980sAs such the United States probably cannot use its national storage stocks to artificially manipulate the price of crude oil anymore After all there is a minimum amount of crude oil that needs to be stored in the salt caverns simply to maintain their structural integrity Thus with the cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remaining in effect the balance between the supply and demand for crude oil became tighter and pushed up energy pricesHowever we still see in the chart above that the average price of crude oil was lower in the third quarter of this year than during the equivalent quarter of last year This is reflected in TotalEnergies results as the company reported that it received an average of 7890 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the quarter compared to 9360 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the equivalent quarter of last year It should be fairly obvious why this would have a negative impact on TotalEnergies financial performance After all if the company received less money per unit of product sold then its overall revenue will be lower all else being equalHowever all else is rarely equal with a company like TotalEnergies As noted in the highlights the company saw its production decline in the most recent quarter compared to the equivalent one last year During the third quarter of 2023 TotalEnergies produced an average of 2476 million barrels of oil equivalents per day That was a 723 decline from the 2669 million barrels of oil equivalents per day that the company averaged during the yearago quarter That also had a negative impact on the companys financial performance After all a lower production means that it has fewer products that it can sell in exchange for moneyWhen we combine the companys lower production with the fact that it received less money per unit of product sold it should be fairly easy to see why the companys revenue would go down from period to period The decline in revenue generally means that the company has less money available to cover its fixed expenses and similar things which results in a decline in operating income That is exactly what we see hereWith that said the companys crude oil production was actually up even though its total production was down yearoveryearAs we can see crude oil production went up by 101000 barrels per day on average which represents a 778 increase This was more than offset by a massive decline in the companys production of natural gas which decreased its oilequivalent production overall Perhaps the biggest reason for this appears to relate to the sanctions that the United States and the European Union have levied on Russia According to a  that the company issued in March of 2022The company does not explicitly state in its earnings press release that it was the removal of Novatek  from its results reporting around the end of last year that is responsible for the production decline that we see reflected in these results However it seems likely as the company states that its hydrocarbon production went up once Novateks production is excluded from the yearago figures During the third quarter of 2022 TotalEnergies produced an average of 2356 million barrels of oil equivalents per day excluding Novateks contribution to its upstream production figures The companys production excluding Novatek was 2476 million barrels per day on average during the most recent quarter That was a 509 yearoveryear increase Thus it seems likely that one major contributor to TotalEnergies weaker financial performance yearoveryear is because of the Russian sanctions that were levied due to the situation in UkraineTotalEnergies did benefit from a few new sources of production in the quarter These include the following projectsThe company states that these projects alone increased its yearoveryear hydrocarbon production by 5 While this was partially offset by things such as natural field production declines and the aforementioned problems with TotalEnergies stake in Novatek it is still good to see that some projects are coming on that are having a positive impact on the company Clearly it is not all bad news hereAs I have explained in numerous previous articlesAs of the time of writing interest rates in most developed nations are at the highest rates that have been seen in many years After all most developed countries printed enormous amounts of money to help support their economies through the COVID19 lockdowns and this sparked a worldwide inflation crisis Most central banks in the Group of Twenty nations have been raising interest rates over the past two years in an effort to combat this inflation crisis However TotalEnergies has not really been impacted by rising rates so far As we can see here while the companys interest expenses have indeed been rising over the past few quarters its investment income has also been risingThis is partly due to the fact that energy companies in general have been using some of their good fortunes from supportive energy prices over the past few years to strengthen their balance sheets That has been quite necessary considering that the market has not been especially friendly to traditional energy companies in general As might be expected given these two factors TotalEnergies has been reducing its net debt over the past several quartersThis has allowed the company to offset some of the impact of higher rates as it has a lesser amount of debt upon which it needs to pay financing costs Meanwhile the company has kept its cash and cash equivalents at a relatively stable levelThis has allowed the company to increase the amount of interest that it collects from things such as money market funds and shortduration bonds This has helped to offset the added amount of interest that the company needs to pay on the debt that it continues to carry Thus the companys net interest expenses have not really been too badly impacted by the rising rate environment This is certainly a better situation than what we have seen with companies in sectors such as utilities see As is always the case we should take a moment to have a look at TotalEnergies financial structure The usual way that we accomplish this is by looking at the net debttoequity ratio As shown above TotalEnergies had a net debt outstanding of 26690 billion on September 30 2023 On the same date the company had a total equity of 118424 billion This gives the company a net debttoequity ratio of 023 today Here is how that compares to some of the companys peersAs we can see here TotalEnergies has considerably more debt than comparable American companies but it does compare reasonably well to its European peers This is a sign that the company is probably not overly reliant on debt to finance its operations We should not have to worry too much about the companys debt load even in todays relatively highrate environmentTotalEnergies has long been known for offering a relatively high dividend yield compared to many other assets that are available in the market It is not necessarily alone in this though as the entire energy sector is one of the highestyielding sectors in the market Indeed the iShares Global Energy ETF  which tracks a portfolio of major traditional energy companies from around the world currently yields 458 which is substantially higher than many other sector index fundsFor its part TotalEnergies currently has a 464 yield so its stock certainly does not disappoint in this respect After all there are not very many common stocks that boast such a high yield and have relatively strong forward growth prospects Unfortunately TotalEnergies dividend has not been especially stable over the yearsOne of the biggest reasons for this is that TotalEnergies declares and pays its dividends in euros despite the fact that the company actually reports its results in US dollars The fact that it actually pays the dividend in euros means though that those investors who hold the American Depositary Receipts which is anyone who buys the shares that trade on an American exchange receive the US dollar equivalent of the dividend It is pretty common for foreign companies owned by American investors to have a dividend that fluctuates with exchange rates for this reasonAs is always the case though we want to ensure that the company can actually afford the dividends that it pays out After all we do not want to be the victims of an unexpected dividend cut since that would reduce our incomes and almost certainly cause the companys share price to declineThe usual way that we judge a companys ability to cover its dividend is by looking at its free cash flow During the twelvemonth period that ended on September 30 2023 TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of 272054 billion but only paid out dividends of 75940 billion Thus the company easily generated more than enough cash through its ordinary operations to cover its dividendsWe see the same general thing when we measure the companys free cash flow and dividends in euros During the twelvemonth period TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of  57336 billion but only paid out  1832 billion in dividends to the shareholders Thus the company is clearly not having any particular difficulty maintaining its dividends We should not need to worry too much about a potential cut TotalEnergies will grow its earnings per share at a 930 rate over the next three to five years This gives the stock a pricetoearnings growth ratio of 073 at the current price That suggests that the stock is undervalued at the current price However as I have pointed out in a variety of articles and blog posts over the past several months nearly everything in the traditional energy industry appears to be significantly undervalued right nowThus the best way for us to value the company is by comparing TotalEnergies valuation to its peers in order to determine which stock offers the most attractive relative valuationAs we can see here TotalEnergies appears to boast a very reasonable valuation relative to many of its peers This could suggest that the companys stock is worth purchasing today That is especially true considering the rather strong fundamentals for crude oil which we have discussed in numerous previous articles here at Energy Profits in DividendsIn conclusion TotalEnergies third quarter 2023 earnings results were overall quite decent even if they were worse than the companys numbers during the prioryear quarter The fact that energy prices were lower in the reporting period compared to 2022 was a major drag on the firms performance and the sanctions that have been levied by the Western powers on Russia also do not help Despite this though TotalEnergies still looks like a reasonable purchase right now as the companys valuation remains attractive and its balance sheet is strong The fact that it sports a 464 yield at the current price only adds to its appeal Overall the company may be worth considering todayEditors Note This article

294,Jackson Hole: The Fed Faces The Ghosts Of The 1970s As Stock Market Rollercoaster Continues,Next week the Federal Reserve hosts its annual  Each year roughly 120 central bankers media members academics and business leaders attend to share research and escape the summer heat Unlike its Since then stocks have been on a rollercoaster with the SP 500  fluctuating in a range above itsStocks have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last year though volatility slowed significantly as summer arrived The 15 selloff in the SP 500 was soon followed by a rally in hopes of a Fed pivot The rally soon fizzled when Powell didnt give the market what they were looking for and investors began to sell popular stocks in December for tax loss harvesting Markets rallied again on pivot hopes only to be pushed back down after the next Fed meeting in February Stocks fell sharply during the shortlived spring bank crisis while the subsequent postbankcrisis rally seems mostly driven by sentiment and fear of missing out Some profittaking followed and here we are roughly at the same price as a year ago after 12 months of tugofwar However Jackson Hole may break the stalemateIn Powells speech last year he alluded several times to the policy mistakes of the 1970s Then the Feds lack of commitment to fighting inflation contributed in large part to allowing core inflation to rise from roughly  Inflation came in three waves then and the Fed would raise rates to halfheartedly fight inflation only to cut them too soon and allow inflation to roar backMost people reading this know the story of how Arab nations imposed a  on the United States Canada and the UK in 1973 More than a few of you reading this likely lived through the gas shortages 55 mph speed limits and skyhigh inflation In 1973 oil prices skyrocketed and stock markets crashed The SP 500 fell 48 from peak to trough fared much worse falling over 73 from peak to troughLess widely known is how a series of policy mistakes that traded shortterm gain for longterm gain set the stage for this This is one reason that political pundits tend to think  while  it may be harderCompare this with todaySo far the Fed has steadily raised interest rates until theyve reached a positive real yield Sound  this is what is needed to bring down inflation Now theyll have to raise them a bit more and keep them above the rate of inflation in order to avoid a disastrous repeat of the 1970s  from the last meeting showed that members feared upside risks to inflation which is why most members support hiking interest rates a bit more even with some progress on inflation The market is skeptical  that the Fed is done hiking and will soon begin to cut However the Fed said theyre going to hike  so there are plenty of people including me who will take them at their wordThe key to understanding the Summary of Economic Projections is to read between the lines By comparing the rate of core inflation the Fed projects and the interest rate it projects we gain an understanding of how the Fed is likely to respond to rising or falling inflation Essentially theyre looking for a about 2 real yield on cash That means if core inflation is 35 then theyre going to hike one more time and hold rates at a level of 2 above inflation This is in sharp contrast to many traders who think that if inflation goes to 3 that the Fed will aggressively start to cut when job growth slows or reverses Thats not what the Fed is saying at all and the difference might be enough to get traders to seriously reevaluate their bets Under this framework rates stay above 5 until inflation is under 3Why wouldnt the Fed cut rates much when inflation slows down to 3 or so Quite simply thats how they got burned in the 1970s so theyre going to take their time Modeling  supports this viewI calibrated the model to run using core inflation ignoring rising oil prices and added an interest rate smoothing feature to account for rents starting to fall Still almost all of the models here are calling for more rate hikes with most favoring an interest rate above 6 The Feds dotplot represents a compromise between the more hawkish members and dovish members worried about the banking system but a cash rate of 575 followed by a long hold seems like the most likely outcome here The market isnt quite pricing this so traders may be caught by surprise that the Fed isnt looking to bail them out Their surprise may be compounded if stocks fall sharply in the coming months and the Fed hikes again rather than pivoting to cutsIts crucially important that the Fed doesnt allow another 1970sstyle inflation surge Its equally important for the Fed to not cave to political pressure to print money to let Congress off the hook for outofcontrol spending There is no alternative By the end of the 1970s Americans trust in the government was shattered living standards had stagnated and the top political priority for voters was ending inflation People were fed up Thats why they let Fed chair Paul Volcker drop the hammer on the economy and raise rates to 20 By taking a hard line now the Fed can ensure we dont have to end up in that position again after multiple consecutive waves of inflation as was the case in the 1970sThis entire article really boils down to one question The Fed is offering a 55 riskfree return in cash and shortterm bonds Should you take it and if so for how much of your asset allocation Im inclined to believe the Fed here For the past year Ive said yestake the riskfree return and for a decent percentage of your portfolio The downside is asymmetric at current stock market valuations Well find out more about the Feds intentions at Jackson Hole next weekWhat do you think Will the Federal Reserve repeat the mistakes of the 1970s or have

295,Vonovia: Updating My Short Thesis Following Q2 Results,Im reiterating my Strong Sell rating on Vonovia SE after reviewing the 2nd quarter resultsOn March 28th 2023 I issued a  against Vonovia SE   arguing that theAfter the Q1 report I published an  in which I elaborated on several aspects that clearly send a signal of further pain to comeLet me know quickly recap the main drivers of my bear thesisNow I have to admit that my sell thesis has been a complete disaster because of the strong total return performance by Vonovia  40 since the date of my first article shares of VNNVF bottomed out at 17 when I published near the end of March 2023 However looking at the Q2 figures I have to also admit that my conviction about Vonovias permanent value impairment has strengthenedEssentially it is the usual problem with shorting companies that whenever the valuations are depressed pricing in a justified decline in value each positive announcement no matter how impactful it is can send the stock price materially higherFor example during Q2 Vonovia announced a buyback of its outstanding bonds at a 11 discount to the nominal value Vonovia bought back   0 billion While this sounds good if we contextualize this with the total debt burden it explains just over 2 of the total debt And the fact that Vonovia was able to buy back bonds at 11 discount was not a surprise at all since we could see how the public market were discounting the outstanding bonds before Q2 We could also interpret this as a confirmation that the cost of financing for Vonovia has gone up and is materially above the currently carried weighted average cost of financingSo let me now turn to the Q2 2023 data and walk you through my thinking on why the bear case has just become more straightforwardGiven that my thesis is structural without any catalysts besides the ECB factor which could either destroy the Company completely or make it one of the best investments in the German market for me it is critical to assess data in the rate of change terms In other words I predict a gradual bleed process where quarter by quarter Vonovia marches closer to a massive equity dilution event ie cost of financing over dwarfing the yield component and inflicting knockon effects on the covenant sideThis is why I will focus on the quartertoquarter data comparing Q1 2023 to Q2 2023 which is the opposite approach to how Vonovia reflects its rate of change in the Q2 financial statements they compare H1 2023 to H2 2022 If I was to look at the Q2 2022 data and contrast it with Q2 2023 the conclusions would be rather boring  negative performance across the boardAs a result of all of this the EPRA NTA declined from EUR 537 per share in Q1 2023 to EUR 497 per share in Q2 2023 or 8 of a declineVonovias share price reaction upon the issuance of Q2 figures was negative 2The key message that I would like to extract from the Q2 figures is the structural difficulty of Vonovia to ride out of the overleveraged situation when interest rates are so high The technical term that we can see happening now is the debt overhang situation when the leverage has become so high that sooner or later there will be a default due to insufficient cash generation in the context of the embedded covenants unless there is an equity dilution eventAs of YTD Vonovia has made three sizeable divestitures ie Sudewo portfolio five notable properties in Berlin with a total of 1350 apartments and exit from French JV monetizing their assets and  or participation in JVs it has introduced scrip dividends which relaxes the pressure from dividend distributions and replaces that with share issuances and it has used most of the received proceeds to retire some part of the outstanding bonds at a discount to the nominal Plus performancewise Vonovia has done a solid job by capitalizing on the favourable supply and demand dynamics in the German residential spaceWith all of this in mind we can still see deteriorating performance on the underlying cash flow level and the corresponding coverage frontAnd dear readers the worst thing is that Vonovia has not yet felt tangible pressure from the higher interest rates As of H1 2023 the weighted average cost of debt stood at 16 which is just 01 higher than in Q1 2023Looking at Vonovias publicly traded bonds we can see YTM levels of around 5  55 Loan or bank financing terms are a bit more favourable hovering around 4  45If we tripled or aligned Vonovias cost of financing level to what the Company can actually get in the market there would be a direct breach of ICR covenant ie ICR falling below 18xTo breach the LTV covenant it would take a 25 downward correction in asset fair values In my opinion this is unlikely although the market is pricing in a more aggressive drop due to the lack of supply of residential units in GermanyQ2 2023 results reveal in how difficult situation Vonovia is where aggressive deleveraging efforts in conjunction with strong likeforlike performance is not sufficient to offset the consequences from astronomical leverageEven after bond repurchases monetization of JVs and  or several residential unit blocks and improved rents the results have worsenedThe most shocking thing is that this has taken place despite the average cost of financing level of Vonovia going up by only 1 basis point In reality considering the prevailing market terms there are some  300 basis points to goGranted this will not happen overnight as Vonovia has already paid off notable portion of 2023 maturities and will likely make huge efforts to do the same thing for 2024 maturities The current debt maturity profile is rather wellstaggered Plus Vonovia has entered several swap agreements fixing rates on favourable terms for the next two years on some portion of the outstanding debt that was still variable before Q2 2023However if the higher for longer scenario really takes place Vonovia will sooner or later face significant consequences via the breach of covenants or just considerably squeezed margins And here the key area of concern is the ICR coverage ratio If we assume that Vonovia will eventually land its cost of financing rate close to the current market level the ICR would clearly fall under the stipulated minimal level of 18xIn my humble opinion the short thesis boils down to the path that ECB will be taking over the next couple of years If we have status quo or higher rates it will eventually erode the current headroom in the ICR coverage or significantly squeeze the free cash flows If rates go down Vonovia should survive without major share issuances and bulls would enjoy decent gains from recovery in the multipleThe other key risk which has to be considered for bears is that this will be a slow process as the current debt maturity profile of Vonovia protects the cash flows from rapid convergence to the market level cost of financing This coupled with relatively depressed multiple can cause serious damage for the short sellers whenever there is something positive announced no matter how materialFinally it is great to see that some external analysts have started to believe in the short thesis as well A month  Vonovia to sell from hold arguing that the Company is subject to a protracted hangover after a seemingly endless party of growth fuelled by ever cheaper finance Almost

297,Toll Brothers: Slowdown Delayed Not Escaped,Toll Brothers  strong performance this year was still under the buoyancy provided by the previous backlog while multiple factors from the perspective of its own logistics and the macro picture suggestedWe previously initiated coverage of Toll Brothers in January this year with a hold rating when it was 5546 expecting its price to be within a range of 45 to 62 The thesis was built on the expected slowdown from its backlog and the macro environment pressure in addition to the normalization of the housing market The company reported strong numbers so far this year but our previous thesis still holds and we will explain whySince our article was published in January this year Toll Brothers annual growth rates for revenue free cash flow and gross profits have been trending flat to lower Although they are coming back down from historic highs the growth is nonetheless moderatingToll Brothers backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to the home buyers Just as we predicted in the previous article the falling backlog has shown Not only has the absolute value of the backlog dropped from 887 to now 787 billion but the backlogtorevenue ratio has come down from 8632 in October last year to 7364 in July this year In fact this ratio is the lowest since 2020 According to its 10k of 2022 the company expects to deliver approximately 90 of these homes within the next fiscal year So we can assume that backlog tends to have a lagging effect on its revenue by about four quarters The current strong performance of its revenue is still under the influence of its backlog from July to October last year The pull on the revenue going forward that was expected from the current backlog will become lowerToll Brothers has continued to push into the urban apartment market to explore more potential growth engines The company formed Toll Brothers City Living unit to leverage its luxury brand in urban areas Its pipeline includes most of the major cities on the east coast south and west except midwest cities It had spent in Q3 2635 million in purchasing contracts to acquire land for apartment developmentSince the companys affordable luxury market focuses on millennials or empty nesters it is not surprising the apartment market is the logical choice due to its community formation appeal to the younger professional that in turn provides higher sales volume for the investment and its costsaving of using steel framing in the building process These factors underpin the affordability that it is trying to achieveHowever the sales of the apartment building assets are not as good as expected which has impacted the fullyear joint venture land sales and other income to be 105 million down from the 125 million expected at the start of the year This guidance is still hinged on the sale of three stabilized apartment communities that are to be closed in Q4 Its ancillary business which includes apartment and city living has reported losses for the three and nine months ending on July 31 with higher expenses than revenueToll Brothers cash conversion cycle is at around 438 days which is mostly due to its faster inventory turnaround But it is almost as good as it gets There is very little room to improve compared with its best records in the past twenty years while it could become prolonged to 700800 days the average of the past twenty years or soTo update the previous mortgage loan held for sale data it has fallen from 193 million to 83 million the majority of which are residential mortgage loans On one hand this poses fewer risks to its portfolio that is subject to higher interest rate risks on the other hand with its home sales rising by 185 YoY in the quarter ending in July there were 50 fewer mortgage loans held for sale on its book This is due to 182 fewer mortgage loans originating in the first nine months of this year and also reflects the tougher environment brought by the higher interest rate risks for the residential market Either the company intentionally tightened the lending standard for cautious reasons or there were less qualified borrowers Either way it leads to fewer sales down the road which brings us to the macro pictureToll Brothers latest presentation has a slide that compares the housing starts with the number of households concluding the industry is undersupplied We think this is not an accurate depiction of the situation The number of households will always increase monotonically in the long term Yet housing starts can be best utilized to satisfy the incremental demands not the entire stock of householdsTherefore we fixed up the following chart to see if we can show a picture more closely resembling the dynamics We charted a 12month average of monthly household formation which is defined as the incremental change of the number of households on a monthly basis against the monthly privateowned housing starts from 1959 till June of this year What we found is the average of household formation for the past 12 months although strong when paired up with the current level of housing starts it is right in the middle of the cluster It is neither too high nor too low Especially with the latest number reported in June falling slightly in the negatives there is no significant undersupply for the industry from a highlevel perspective With that said it is not excluding local regions heating up from supply and demand dynamics but overall the frenzy we saw in the past two years will not return any time soonOn the other hand the current free cash flow Toll Brothers produce is an outlier compared with its historical norm What it means is it cannot sustain at these levels without regressing back to the averageThe current level of the owners equivalent rent for a primary residence is unsustainable given the interest rate environment With 533 Fed Funds rate the current rent level is almost double where it has been historically For the inflation situation to fully come under control from the Feds point of view rent being one of the largest items in the CPI basket it will budge soon Even if it doesnt fall back down by half a moderation or decline should be expected This goes back to Toll Brothers efforts in expanding in the city and apartment living The margin growth in that market may not be taking off in the near termLastly although this doesnt necessarily provide causation for stock valuation its nonetheless observed that the high stock price has led to the most expensive and slowest stock repurchase for the company since 2016 With almost half of what it spent in 2022 240 million stock repurchase has only bought back 35 million shares so far this year roughly onethird of the number of shares it bought back last yearWe are sticking to our previous valuation and anticipate the slowdown we expected in January to come into play in Q4 or Q1 next year The current price has risen above our bullish case by almost 14Toll Brothers has made higher sales this year against a tougher interest rate environment which resulted in better cash flow and earnings so far But we think this is mostly due to the influence of a previously higher backlog which has fallen by more than 10 in the latest quarter The effect of slowing down will start showing in Q4 latest Q1 next year and the macro pressure is pointing to a normalization that is merely being delayed not escaped With its price rising above our bullish case we think its stock is overvalued at the moment and recommend a sell   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed

299,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time As Ive said in previous articles quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing and XOM is no differentAt time of writing XOM trades at a trailing PE ratio of 87x a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector However its forward PE is 12x 15 above sector peers This premium exists for XOMs PB price to book and PCash flow as well trading at a premium of over 25 and over 50 above the energy sector respectively Even though XOMs PS price to sales is slightly discounted at 10 below sector most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey as is expected for such a dominant oil firmAs long as the oil market remains healthy XOMs premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the worlds premier energy companies However a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances ultimately devaluing XOM stock Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM but in my opinion this stock might be ripe for a decline one that is not yet priced into its stocks somewhat rich valuation multiplesAs I have stated Exxon and XOMs fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry due to oils overwhelming centrality to Exxons business model Accordingly to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline we must understand the reasons why the oil industry and fossil fuels overall are set to decline These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article culminating in my rating for XOM stockTo understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument the fact that renewables are rising Why is this happening and why does it mean the end of oilTo start the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history especially in the last century or so Technologies chemistries and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today These include new ways to generate energyRegarding renewable energy generation specifically to make  short scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances different manufacturing methods designs and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy  more compact energy dense batteries greater energy absorption from solar panels better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and moreThese improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible  producing and storing as much energy as possible for as long as possible with the longest lifespans possible and with the fewest materials and resources possible As an overlooked side benefit these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar roomsized behemoths to hundred dollar handsized devices innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient cheaper viable massmarket energy sourcesOver several decades the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations Now in the 2020s this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources see Lazard data referenced later ie fossil fuels and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market which I will detail later in this sectionAs the prices for renewables fall renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size and efficient enough in energy production that smaller industrial firms factories power plants businesses and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will This means that due to competitive pricing high efficiency and high scalability renewable power generation is readily decentralized setting it up for rapid mass adoptionThis is not possible with fossil fuels it and never will be The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction transportation refinement combustion and distribution is too large for any small firm let alone a single household to handle in a reasonably costeffective mannerBy contrast renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time with no transportation or combustion necessary Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy and then letting the environment fill it up from there Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicletogrid transference is optional but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent The refinement process for renewables ie converting renewable energy to electricity switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage etc is quick and highly efficient at every step Simply put the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuelsEven so one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost the onetime payment for the devices themselves to generate power the renewable energy produced afterward is free and the onetime cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy producedRenewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized free power over centralized pricey power production where possible This does not bode well for oil companies other fossil fuel companies or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF  Reeves Utility Income Trust  DNP Select Income Fund  Vanguard Utilities Index ETF  Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fueldependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure Put another way when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free they will rarely if ever need to pay for energy from utility companiesFurthermore as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices economies of scale will start to ramp up High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables which will prompt greater production of renewable devicestech which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale which will prompt further cost and price declines which will prompt greater demand and so on This vicious cycle or virtuous cycle stands in stark contrast to the oil market where prices seem to rarely decrease for long no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy As demand for renewables rises and its unique benefits become clear demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronouncedWith these market dynamics at play renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply meanwhile fossil fuels will see everdecreasing demand and soon will not be able to compete as energy sourcesFor about two centuries oil and coal were the only highenergy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them such as nuclear power and natural gas yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels Natural gas itself has become  in recent years and renewables are now competitive with if not cheaper than fossil fuelsAccording to Lazard Ltds  of the Levelized Cost of ElectricityEnergy or LCOE essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled  without renewable subsidies with subsidies adjusting for fuel prices a hypothetical carbon tax component costs and so on Ultimately Lazards data demonstrates that renewables which were once  back in 2009 have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan In fact it has been argued that renewable energy sources specifically solar wind and battery storage have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE Regardless the cheapness of renewable power once added to the energy market stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installedConsider the example of Texas The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century and Texas still  of the United States oil today The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy As the major producer of its most indemand energy sources Texas unsurprisingly has had some of the countrys lowest energy prices over the last 50 years  opens in ExcelThis was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home Yet even in Texas renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price Based on an  of Texass power grid with vs without renewable energy renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022 This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given regionAll this to say renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities states provinces and countries to use to power their economies From the  to the  from  to  to  and even in  renewables are often the goto option for power plant buildout since they may now be one of the less expensive options available Furthermore renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels with  and  still falling future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power displacing some aging fossil fuelbased projects on the basis of cost alone This will devastate oil in particular especially in the US Electric vehicle registrations are  and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy  both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuelsAssuming these trends persist and broaden they will destroy most of the demand for oil since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about  aggregating Road Rail Aviation and Industry As these sources of demand dry up the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normalTo round this section out let me highlight two important points  the global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years and renewables are set to account for over 90 of global electricity expansion in that same time span Additionally there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world and eliminate over 99 of global carbon emissions to boot If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables then almost every nation will do so This will allow fastspreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable marketIn short not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations Further renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations economic preferences and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapesBut the bad news doesnt end thereAs with our ability to switch to renewables the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change humans are  and the consequences are being felt and measured  If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities nations and whole continents Severe storms floods freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace and things are only set to worsen Left unchecked climate change will  and cause devastating  a onetwo punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human sufferingBecause of this governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum Some nations such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol acted faster than others but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituentsAccordingly  various pieces of European Union EU legislation and policies like the European Green Deal and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act IRA are stuffed with climaterelated mandates and incentives Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere including tackling the root cause fossil fuels  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035 this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens fossil fuel consumptionAdditionally the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climatefriendly programs and technologies much more appealing  possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuelsFor instance  much of the IRAs funding is designed to  in clean energy transport and manufacturing emphasis added In other words IRA funding is meant to jumpstart an  buying spree of renewable energy tech as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into lawNeedless to say regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 1015 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry and does not set it up for a decade of success Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements but the longterm trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakableTo illustrate a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry to the  of many environmentalists however an  of the law by the think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings energy use home electrification and green lands set aside as carbon sinks emphasis added While the realworld ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates the intent and impact of the law is clear ramp up renewables curb carbonThese legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry and to the fossil fuel industry at large will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade For all intents and purposes governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use and their word is lawGovernments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of  The US is an infamous example of this having lavishly funded the industry  However as renewable energy technology has evolved governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well  global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time representing a 31 increase from 2021As renewable energy investment continues trending upward governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States Soon these governments will be forced to subsidize just oneAssuming they are rational in their decision they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities ie choose renewables and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables it will be a big financial blow to the industry including oil firmsIf cost alone doesnt make the decision for governments easy the following consideration might force their handWhat are two things that Russia Saudi Arabia and Iran have in common They are among  in the last decade and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations Western nations interests consist primarily of protecting human rights defending global law and order and preserving political liberalism not to be confused with partisan liberalism By contrast Russia Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in or actively opposed to these notionsTo be fair these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters  Canada and Norway are top producers too after all But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy Russia Saudi Arabia Iran and other such oilrich nations influence and ability to cause trouble would decline Therefore Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective and will pursue it as they do other national security issuesAdditionally the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPECOPEC which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations but most nations on earth and would diminish OPECs influence on energy prices and global affairs Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables if only to free themselves from OPECs price controlsAll of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industryAs if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough the oil industry often courts scandal and  From the ExxonValdez and Deepwater Horizon spills to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry be it  or   or  the wellpublicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust This sentiment is captured in wellworn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons and that the entire industry is led by crooks thieves and liars in fancy suitsMore importantly the industrys scandals and reputation its  and the rising prices of gasolinepetrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers This isnt all that surprising  people especially Americans have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back  and such disdain likely has a much longer historyWhats more oil companies dont seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty According to  only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decadeWhen the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves resulting in sudden severe and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuelsThis is almost certainly true for Exxon which even has an oil spill named after it Unfortunately for Exxon the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms worsening its position as the energy transition kicks offTaken together all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil the oil industry and the rest of the fossil fuel industry as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables As such I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry and should strongly consider abandoning these companies including Exxon as long term investmentsCompanies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recoverThis includes Exxon of course as well as names such as Chevron Corporation  The Phillips 66 Company  Sempra  ONEOK Inc  OGE Energy Corp  Brooge Energy Ltd  WEC Energy Group Inc  White Energy Company Ltd  Magellan Midstream Partners  Sunoco LP  CenterPoint Energy Inc  Enbridge Inc  TC

InPlay Oil Corp  Inpex Corporation   Shell plc   Dominion Energy Inc  Duke Energy Corporation  Baker Hughes Company  Enterprise Products Partners LP  APA Corporation  Chesapeake Energy Corporation  Warrior Met Coal Inc  PBF Energy Inc  and many moreOn the other hand pure play renewable energy companies and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond These include Enel SpA   Ørsted AS   Iberdrola SA   ReNew Energy Global plc  Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd  Ocean Power Technologies  Tesla Inc  Sunlight Financial Holdings

Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA aka Eletrobrás  Acciona SA  Nextracker Inc  AmmPower Corp  Enphase Energy Inc  Fluence Energy Inc  and Vestas Wind Systems AS   among others Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers including the oil industryAs an aside you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the winners in the energy transition despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy it will be the renewable energy utilities These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuelbased energy grid today This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy useNevertheless even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand longterm as renewable energy production decentralizes they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuelbased energy generation a double whammy for their prospectsLike the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time they may even have a multidecade timespan in mind Therefore the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlashThis cycle w, , ,0
300,Bitcoin: Why I'm Buying 14-Year-Old Tulips With Both Hands,Now is a great time to accumulate Bitcoin  There are many upcoming catalysts for BTC to reward investors over the next year This article will not go into those muchrepeated points If interested research the items in this nonexhaustive list of Bitcoins Halving in 2024  Halvings have historically been followed by a price surge BTC Spot ETF  Bullish because it creates more liquidity and demand Institutional Adoption  Institutional adoption means more liquidity and demand as well It also means more money used to fund the development of financial infrastructure for Bitcoin Regulatory Clarity in Crypto  Reduces the barriers due to regulatory uncertainty Also increases the pace of innovation in crypto Mining to Subsidize Green Energy Solutions  This allows BTC to be recognized as an ESGfriendly asset Bitcoin always was ESG friendly hence toThis article will talk about the utility that Bitcoin development has been unlocking and hence economic value rather than price action from supply and demand Think of this as the fundamentals Bitcoins strong fundamentals should also be overlaid with a sentiment analysis which will be covered first As stated the main takeaway is that right now is probably a great time to accumulate BTCCritics accuse BTC of being a bubble comparing it to the dotcom bubble or to tulips Tulipsbubble assets dont last for 14 years nor do they keep exceeding their previously established alltime high nor are they assets with clear use cases In  I go deep into an undeniable use case of Bitcoin that is little mentionedIf you keep calling this a bubble or keep claiming this is beginning of the end of Bitcoin your actual conclusion is that the market has been wrong for 14 straight yearsOf course there are times when the marketwide time preference shortens Morgan Housels  explores the rationality not irrationality behind bubbles The simple answer is that investors time preference shortens During bubbles the next day or week is nearly guaranteed to see a higher price The time preference of investors collapses from a normal focus on a longer term to an abnormal focus on this immediate short term Abnormal and normal are not denotations of rationality they are simply a statement that most of the time normally time preference is not as short as until tomorrow This is FOMO in its distilled and wholly rational form Bursting bubbles is the opposite as time preference lengthens discounted cash flows become the dominant force of consideration and valuations come back down Sentiment shifts is another name for describing the phenomenon of changing time preferenceThis understanding is also why I have chosen to subdivide my analysis by time preference because within these fluctuations are many opportunities And without at least acknowledging time preference ones investment thesis is hopelessly incompleteWhen we look at Bitcoin in its entire 14year history there are moments of collapsing time preference But 14 years is long for a  shortterm time preference while also supporting an asset that is still outperforming nearly everything else over the same time If these magic internet coins are tulips then by their age alone they are very special tulips indeedThe crypto bear market has dragged on for nearly two years BTC is still down 60 from its alltime high in November 2021 A lot of seemingly bullish news has been met with shortlived spikes followed by longs taking profits BTC has had a tough time breaking through resistance at 30000 over the last five monthsAlso BTCs  is at fiveyear lows signaling an apathetic market The choppy price action of the last few months has been driven by recordlow volumes When volumes pick up again the actual direction of the market should be clearerLow volumes in crypto have been making  Most crypto is speculation so I interpret this as speculative interest slowing down for a big chunk of the industry Comments in the linked article also suggested the same interpretation However it is key to separate the utility of speculation from the utility of Bitcoin If you believe that Bitcoin has intrinsic utility then this period of apathy in which the baby is seemingly being thrown out with the bathwater is a great time to accumulate I am reminded of the bloodbath in REITs over this last year when astute investors were able to scoop up good deals as the market relentlessly punished all REITs simply for being associated with commercial real estateLikewise BTC model free implied volatility ie a VIX calculation from option prices is also at 4year lows It is likely at alltime lows but the IV data on  does not go back far enough For context crypto prices generally rise with IV This feature is different from equities Such lows in both IV and trading volume should indicate that the crypto bear market is on the precipice of endingGiven historical trends BTC is also at  lows Below are two charts that put BTCs price on a log scale with various annotations The  is a bit like a dynamic RSI that shows oversold and overbought regions It also annotates the halvingsThe  with the 200 Week Moving Average shows that BTC rarely stays below its 200 Week Moving Average The points when it is touching or below this moving average have been great accumulation zonesThese charts all point towards a market that is exhausted and oversold Though not fully capitulated one might argue capitulation was last year when BTC bottomed at around 16000 the sentiment has been negative and apatheticPublic attention this year has been drawn away from crypto and towards trends like AI The investment landscape has been favoring big tech semiconductors and even more recently energy Again the logical consequence of this matches up with what we see in the charts apathy towards BTC and crypto in general as an investmentThis is why now is probably a great time to start a dollar cost average accumulation The sentiment could continue to worsen for a while but the backstop is the fundamental intrinsic value of BTC New use cases have continued to develop over the course of the BTC bear marketThe fundamentals of something like BTC is the potential for usage and adoption BTC aims to be money and all money is backed by the economy which uses it note that this is very different from saying the country that uses it because economies can easily be international The reason the USD is the strongest currency is that the collective households and firms which use the USD constitute the largest economic bloc in the world This is also why countries who try to steer their economies away from using the USD are seen as a threat to dollar hegemony Note that being seen as a threat is different from being an actual threat The dollar hegemony is very strong for reasons deeply embedded in basic international economic principles I cover those in greater detail The more people using Bitcoin for payments the stronger BTCs fundamentals become This same logic does not quite apply to other cryptocurrencies especially because many have token models which make them resemble securities In this case greater use of the underlying blockchain network may lead to price appreciation in the short term as a function of speculation but the price cannot be sustained by the cash flows generated in the long termThe problem with Bitcoin usage is that its not as clearcut as amateur analysts think Some think that because the blockchain is a transparent ledger they can simply look on chain to see whether adoption is happening This works for Ethereum and it is arguably the only good way to objectively measure Ethereum adoption But it doesnt work for BitcoinBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin have started to  but they have taken completely different layer scaling approaches To put it simply Ethereum uses rollups which are basically separate transparent blockchains with their own set of transactions and consensus Thus onchain activity refers not just to the Ethereum base layer but also to all the separate rollup blockchains linked to Ethereum These are all transparentBitcoin meanwhile has used state channels like the Lightning Network  as its L2 scaling solution State channels are not separate blockchains so they do not have the transparency that Ethereum rollups have The basic concept of a state channel is that users can share a common onchain state with each other and then sign updates to change this state One example of an individual state would be how much BTC is owned by either person At any point the signed state updates called commitments  can be published to the blockchain and the corresponding state will be reflected in the main chain This enables people to do an unlimited number of transactions offchain by exchanging commitments with their counterparts with the option of publishing the results of these transactions onchain at any timeWithout going into details about the tradeoffs between a state channel and a rollup solution we can clearly see that the state channel solution is much more elusive to the casual observer because it never appears on chain In fact after the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in 2021 it is impossible to tell when a new state channel for the Lightning Network is being opened or closed Before that it was possible to tell based on onchain information that two users were creating a multisignature address to potentially initiate a state channel There are a few places to look to get an idea  is a site that reports the number of channels and how much BTC is locked in these channels Below is a screenshot of their main dashboard For clarity a Node helps connect multiple channels so that users who do not have direct channels with each other can still pay each other through a mutual connected user in this case the NodeThe important thing to remember is that Lightning dashboards like these can never provide the complete picture the way a complete picture can be provided for Ethereum and its rollups First these are only the  channels that the Lightning Nodes are aware of The Lightning Nodes being surveyed are also only the nodes that this website is aware of Because the code is open source entire communities can set up their own Bitcoin payments system using Lightning infrastructure and never be known by sites like 1ML Finally while we can see how many channels there are there is no way to tell how many transactions are going through those channels Each transaction is a state update signed and kept by the users of the channel so only the users themselves really know their own transaction volume In contrast the exact number of transactions accounts value and even the time each event occurred is always known for the Ethereum ecosystem because one can just add together everything across all the rollups depicts the number BTC locked into channels over time Again these numbers are only what is known There is almost certainly a nonzero number of  channels with BTC that is not counted in this figure Furthermore since the Taproot upgrade in late 2021 and the popularization of Lightning over the last three years the likelihood of more channels being unknown grows higher and higherUnlike Ethereum which has largely focused on growing smart contract functionality for onchain trading Bitcoin development has largely focused on the more practical use cases for the average consumer such as payments and personal banking and nearly always focusing on BTC as the main token In contrast Ethereum projects tend to release their own tokens and focus on infrastructure which can be leveraged to shuffle around many different tokens including and often especially the token the project created for the purpose of earning yields and conducting highly leveraged tradesThus the flavor of innovation is yet another major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum Both ecosystems have innovation but innovative energy is consumed to achieve different objectivesThe Bitcoin ecosystem does not regard a high level of programmability as paramount When I was first learning about crypto this caused me so much confusion and misunderstanding towards Bitcoin It seemed that Ethereum projects were very organized and standardized Each reputable project had its own documentation a list of smart contract addresses a whitepaper of how its proposed features can be implemented onchain a section explaining the projects token details and so forth Though many Ethereum projects did things very differently and in very creative ways they all followed the same basic format of being able to somehow facilitate the exchange of tokens onchain Initially I wrote this off as Bitcoin being the older ecosystem where nothing happened But then the question of why Bitcoin never retreats from its number 1 spot on the crypto market cap ranking became more and pressing You could say this was me reckoning why the market has been so wrongI have now come to realize that Bitcoins innovations are happening constantly but just not in a rigidly standardized manner because the simplicity of Bitcoin leaves so much room for different methods of innovationOne example of this is clearly the Lightning Network Another is something like  an EVM smart contract blockchain that is  with Bitcoin launched back in 2018 Rootstock has over 50 of Bitcoins enormous hash rate securing it making it the second most secure blockchain and the most secure smart contract blockchain in the world Much more recent examples are   and  Each one is a unique approach to Bitcoin scaling that is still in the testing phase Each one is focused on expanding the use case of the BTC token only To keep this short Ill only cover Fedimint which I think is simple enough to describe both nontechnically and conciselyThe basic idea of Fedimint is that communities can create their own multisignature wallets and have trusted members of the community be the guardians who hold the keys of the BTC in the wallet Then the community can mint IOUs against the BTC in the wallet and use a centralized ledger to keep track of IOU transactions while ensuring things like privacy and full reserve backing Each community can adjust the parameters to suit their needs Each instance of a community multisignature wallet with its own BTC IOUs is called an individual Fedimint The Fedimint protocol is also  so Fedimints can be set up to send BTC to other Fedimints via LightningIts clear that Fedimint is another variation of a state channel scaling solution Unlike Lightning it uses a trustbased setup This is okay because Fedimint is intentionally designed for communities  the guardians are members of the community who are known to others and whom others already trust with other things random examples babysitting being a good neighbor dog walking etc Any funny business will have steep social costsThis may not seem too useful in countries with strong rule of law Also many in the West feel no persistent need to trust the members in their community But Fedimint is an absolute game changer for the unbanked of the world and many of these are the exact people who must rely on their communitiesNow apply this to what has already been said about Lightning Fedimints transactions are all offchain With Taproot we cant even know if a new Fedimint is being started Fedimints can send stuff to each other via Lightning another offchain solutionThese kinds of technologies will grow Bitcoin adoption And they are invisible to the casual observer or the junior analyst looking for onchain activity When crypto news platforms are talking more about Ordinals NFTs BRC20 tokens and the ETF than about the development of practical use cases you can be sure that the masses are not aware of all that is happeningBitcoin is a global settlement layer and everything built over it helps increase Bitcoins use case and reach The ecosystem holds the ultimate longterm view slowly help people around the world gain financial autonomy slowly let the free market do its job slowly watch people innovate and take risks without avoidable financial insecurities slowly have each newer generation understand these benefits then slowly become the worlds de facto moneyThe biggest uncertainty today is Bitcoins public relations On the one hand governments are incentivized to try to hold on to their monetary monopoly But this is much harder if more people understand BitcoinIf Bitcoin cannot attract enough public support then governments may be able to establish some hold over it and reaffirm their monopoly over money Thus the risk increases with the number of autocratic regimes governments who do not have to listen to their citizens and increases with the number of people who cannot think critically The former is a falling number but the latter is a rising numberMy suspicion is that as times get worse mainly due to the state of todays money more people will begin to wake up and ask questions likeOh and some of these issues are due to bad life choices  not just the fact that the monetary base has  causing the dollar to  since 1970  so Ill also includeGenerally these questions point one towards the Austrian School sound money and inevitably Bitcoin They might also cause one to cut back on lattes Starbucks  might be a good short idea I dont knowUltimately its a big uncertainty how Bitcoins public perception will emerge after this time The regulatory landscape at least in the US seems more and more crypto friendly and this has been especially true for Bitcoin Bitcoin was notably called out as the only crypto that was certainly not a security Yet many people still believe it is a ponzi schemeThose who believe that governments will move to ban it without any regard for the preference of the people are implicitly denying the power of rule of law and constitutional freedoms They also run the risk of denying the force of the free market which is a very dangerous betThe more useful question is whether people themselves will want money that cannot be debased And this is of course a PR question The prevailing PR campaign has been to encourage the acceptance of inflationary money and benevolent technocrats who dictate monetary policy from above all using highly robust  methodologies no doubt Will Bitcoins PR campaign  involving   less leverage and personal wealth secured by the mere   win any hearts and minds Who knowsThere have never been tulips like Bitcoin I am buying these tulips with both hands because I see the strong fundamentals beneath the surface More importantly most other people do not see these fundamentals yet We can confirm this because many crypto commentators dont even know where to look when it comes to evaluating Bitcoins progress Even more importantly the current sentiment is too negative and apathetic to ignore My recommendation is not for you to take my word on these points but for you to look and find the truth yourselfI reaffirm my buy rating and would upgrade to strong buy at 20000 If it falls below that point I will liquidate some stocks to buy more unless stocks also happen to be down big The next several months should be very interesting with all the catalysts listed at the beginning of this article 2024 looks like a wonderful year for BTC   Past performance is no guarantee of future results

301,Tsakos Energy Navigation: Call Option On Management,Tsakos Energy Navigation  is a speculative play on a potential multiyear upcycle for oil tankers The company has been trading at 035x PNAV despite two quarters of strong earnings with more to come and a record cash balanceThe tanker industry is poised for years of strong earnings ahead as the orderbook has fallen to the  Supply continues to be restricted by high prices and  with earliest delivery dates in late 2026 to early 2027 Should oil demand meet forecast expectations or scrapping of oldThis is my second article covering tanker companies for good reason I believe that the supply and demand setup will lead to multiple years of strong earnings for all owners I highly recommend you read  on Okeanis Eco Tankers  for a more comprehensive explanation on the supportive macro factors and the industryTNP has been a mainstay of the tanker industry for decades  in fact the company is celebrating its 30 anniversary as a public company in 2023It owns and operates  with an average of 10 years Besides crude tankers it also owns a fleet of product tankers shuttle tankers and LNG carriersThe company adopts a more conservative strategy than its peers choosing to employ the majority of its vessels on time charters with profit sharing components than maximizing spot exposureIn  the company reported an extremely strong TCE of 418kd up 112 on Q1 2022s TCE of 197kd This compares favorably against its cash breakeven levels of around 24kd on average leading to net income of 1679m or 569share in the period It also announced that it would be redeeming 88m of its Series D preferred shares alongside a charter backlog of 16bnThat said the shares tumbled upon the release of their Q1 2023 earnings  owing to some questionable things that management did and is somewhat known for Which brings me to my pointsIt would be foolish not to consider management quality when discussing TNP After all it has garnered somewhat of a negative reputation for not placing minority shareholders interests at heart This says a lot considering the shipping industry has left many with sour tastes in their mouths so heres a quick recap of what led the stock to sell off in Q1 2023The company inexplicably used its  subscription required to access link to issue shares diluting the stake of minority shareholders This happened all while shares traded at less than half of NAV  a cardinal sin that shipping investors frowned upon There was no compelling reason to do this and it made investors question management as stewards of their capitalTNP disappointed with its dividends at the end of such a profitable quarter choosing to pay out just 060share across two payments This comes up to a pitiful 3 yield when tanker peers were issuing special dividends to reward their shareholders While the company touts its strong dividend paying history as a plus I believe investors were hoping for more considering its cash balance of 475mIt also pales in comparison when it comes to transparency Other tanker companies have beefed up their investor relations departments even getting on Twitter to engage with investors The company does nothing of that sort and has not even made known the date of their Q2 2023 earnings release it is the 10 of August and many tanker companies have already reportedThis has led to TNP being one of the most undervalued shipping companies on a PNAV basis coming in at roughly 035x against the average of 085x I strongly believe that investors have made their case and management could announce a special dividend and buyback program in the upcoming earnings call This would undoubtedly cause the stock to rerate closer towards the peer group and is a strong nearterm catalyst in my opinionGiven all that management has done or not done the silver lining is that they have many options to demonstrate they have learnt their lessonThe simplest and most direct method is to issue a special dividend to make up for the last quarter A quick calculation shows that TNP has more than sufficient free cash on hand to atone for the small dividend announced earlier this yearAfter accounting for all debt and capital commitments for the rest of 2023 I find that there is still 260m of cash available for distribution That amounts to 860share While the company obviously wont and shouldnt pay out everything there is significant cash on the balance sheet to do soThe company could also opt to fix its dividend policy to offer more transparency to shareholders Its peers have mostly fixed dividends as a percentage of earnings and have been correspondingly rewarded with higher PNAV multiples Alternatively TNP could announce a buyback program and go through with it There is nothing more accretive than repurchasing your own shares when they trade at such a low valuationAs a shareholder I would also like to see TNP improve its investor communications That might not be a strong nearterm catalyst but should close the valuation gap somewhat going forwardI also believe that investors overlook the fact that TNP is a very profitable enterprise with a sound chartering strategy against its breakeven levels Regardless of how management has treated shareholders they have been running a tight ship in their organizationIt currently has 45 77 vessels with secured revenue contracts and 31 vessels 53 with spot exposure The percentages do not add to 100 as some vessels are on time charters with profit sharing hence some overlap 6 out of its 8 vessels under construction also have longterm charters attached to them significantly derisking the purchase costsLooking at their  and the charters they currently have I find that the secured revenue components alone nearly cover the entire fleet breakeven The 18 profitsharing vessels and 14 vessels on spot charters merely need to generate 140kd for TNP to turn an operating profit This should not be a problem in any market let alone the upcycle we are headed towardsTNP owns a large fleet of vessels which have seen  over the last year in part due to inflation as well as a strong rate environment I believe that this should act as a floor for its share priceTo estimate the current market value of its fleet I used  as a guide and arrived at a rough estimate of 309bn for its vesselsAccording to my rough estimates a fair price for TNP  would be around 6141 giving it nearly 180 upside from todays share price of around 22shareBut we know that is unlikely to play out so here are my share price estimates under different scenarios with room for error on the vessel valuesWhile this represents a wide range of possible values it also demonstrates how asymmetric the return profile is from here A very pessimistic view of asset values declining 15 and a PNAV of 030x assuming management does not reward shareholders results in a 38 decline in share priceOn the other hand should management become more shareholder friendly my base case calls for a rerating of the stock to 06x NAV I recognize that investors are unlikely to view TNP as favorably as they do other tanker companies hence the slight discount to peer averages of 085x NAV This scenario results in a 67 increase in share price to 3685 which in my opinion still understates the true value of TNPs assetsGlobal oil and gas demand sanctions and the OPEC cuts are all headwinds that TNP faces as a business However I think that the companys conservative chartering strategy should help it weather any downturns better than peers operating 100 on spot While vessel values could still come down it poses a smaller risk to TNP which is already trading at a depressed multiple compared to the other tanker companiesManagement remains the biggest unknown here Investors are reliant on management to become more shareholder friendly to unlock value There is no way of predicting how they will react to investors demands and I believe it is a risk that investors must contend with in this investmentTNP is simultaneously a play on the multiyear tanker upcycle and a call option on management It is a profitable cash generating enterprise with a sound chartering strategy and diversified fleet of vessels It trades at 035x PNAV significantly lower than peers as management has not been the friendliest to shareholders in the pastThat said there are multiple ways management could surprise investors in the upcoming earnings call I believe that TNP could pay off in an asymmetric manner as valuations have been depressed and asset values should act as a backstop

302,Thoughts From The Municipal Bond Desk (October Edition),In our latest update on whats going on in the muni market we ask and answer The Feds action was widely expected Underlying inflation cooled faster than policymakers expected suggesting that their efforts to restrain inflation have largely been successful But the Fed has also said its concerned that strongerthanexpected economic growth could boost inflationary trends On balance this suggests to me that the Fed will remain on pause  or even end interest rate hikes  unless the data indicates otherwise That We often see disappointing performance during September and October when returns have historically been weaker than at other times of the year During these months we typically have a weak coupon payment season and generally high net issuance resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand Now through late October may be a good time to put new money to work at a potentially lower cost basis Alternatively November December and January have tended to be good months for munis with the January reinvestment period one of the most potentially advantageous times to be invested I think wed all like for the government to avert a shutdown but the odds arent good The last time federal government shutdown was December 21 2018 It was a partial one lasting 35 days Consensus is that a brief shutdown one lasting 30 days or less could delay certain federal payments to municipal issuers but would have minimaltono credit impact on municipal debt That said a more protracted shutdown would be more concerning The silver lining for munis is that unlike previous shutdowns municipalities have received record amounts of federal stimulus since 2020 Billions were allocated to municipalities from the American Rescue Plan Act the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act This is a reallife example of why strong rainy day fund balances are so important They just might be the thing that gets munis through a potential government shutdownA quick look at some commonly used muni market data pointsSources Lipper US Fund Flows JPMorgan YTD  yeartodateNA3150907Municipal securities are subject to the risk that legislative or economic conditions could affect an issuers ability to make payments of principal andor interestJunk bonds involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuers credit qualityThe value of investments and any income will fluctuate this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations and investors may not get back the full amount investedThe values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of highquality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periodsAll fixed income securities are subject to two types of risk credit risk and interest rate risk Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and or repay the principal on its debt Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versaMunicipal bonds are issued by state and local government agencies to finance public projects and services They typically pay interest that is taxfree in their state of issuance Because of their tax benefits municipal bonds usually offer lower pretax yields than similar taxable bondsAll data as of September 27 2023 unless otherwise statedAll data provided by Invesco unless otherwise notedThe opinions expressed are those of the author are based on current market conditions and are subject to change without notice These opinions may differ from those of other Invesco investment professionalsInvesco does not provide tax advice The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature It is not intended or written to be used and it cannot be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under US federal tax laws Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing Investors should always consult their own legal or tax professional for information concerning their individual situationThis does not constitute a recommendation of any investment strategy or product for a particular investor Investors should consult a financial professional before making any investment decisionsPast performance does not guarantee future results An investment cannot be made into an indexForwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future results They involve risks uncertainties and assumptions there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from expectationsThere is no guarantee the outlooks mentioned will come to pass2023 Invesco Ltd All rights reserved by Invesco US,1,2023-10-13,0
303,4 Reasons I'm Shorting The VIX Despite Geopolitical Risks,The unexpected attack on Israel reminds us thatBut as investors we must look at the implications for markets and despite the shock I think Israels military dominance is ultimately unshaken by these attacks The blow was psychological and tactical not strategic Israel is a mighty country and I think her military prowess gives potential regional state adversaries pause which limits the potential for a regional conflagration Of course the last two significant eventsWe should all be praying for the victims and their families and we should all be asking ourselves stark questions about the future of the Middle East Still we should also remember that financial volatility while redolent of physical volatility is not the same thing We must remember that the markets collective wisdom shrugs off our individual emotional experiencesThe Hamas attack was deadly and it will have profound implications However it does not look like the type of stateversusstate implications on trade from the Yom Kippur War in 1973 will materialize Furthermore the history of fighting in the ArabIsraeli conflict has typically been marked by short duration rather than the type of resourceintensive stalemate that is going on in UkraineHowever war and the deterioration of foreign relations raise prices theres often no way around it So if this issue expands and intensifies it certainly could raise inflationary pressure so I will keep a close eye on this risk as the events momentum becomes more apparent in the coming days and weeks Im assuming that despite the shock factor of the Hamas attack the effect on markets will be broadly similar to other highintensity periods in the ArabIsraeli Conflict during the 21st centuryWhile the relatively lowintensity conflict between Arabs and Palestinians slowly rumbles through time it doesnt have the same profound economic effects as when a conflict interrupts food production in one of the worlds largest grain producers So I think as devastating and sickening as these attacks were the ultimate effect on global commerce will be much less than Russias Invasion of UkraineIndeed the market has sent two overwhelmingly bullish messages in less than a weekAnecdotally when markets rally on bad news Im typically heartily encouraged I have found this indicative of turning points in the postCOVID markets These two events alone make me very bullish on the disposition of the market into yearend but there are four significant reasons why I will be shorting volatility into the end of the yearI have written extensively before on why I believe have led to the VIX being a somewhat obsolete instrument for catching volatility and why many who expect spikes of levels similar to those seen in COVID19 and the Global Financial will likely be  This is the primary reason why many investors have been fretting about a suppressed VIX To sum up a key conclusion of my prior workOf course a crucial distinction must be made when talking about why the VIX has been suppressed In my past two articles on the VIX I mainly focused on the structural reasons why volatility was relatively more suppressed while navigating an ominous group of postCOVID19 risks than in previous periods when the market faced similar risksYou can see this at play during the recent VIX spike on interest rate fears and volatility that appeared to peak last week The VIX briefly got above 20 but I think it will continue to retreat into yearend given several factors While I am still convinced the structural and market efficiency factors contribute to a more suppressed VIX I think many factors that will work with them to contribute to a suppressed VIX for the rest of the year are also fundamental and seasonal Here are four reasons why I think the VIX will remain suppressed until the end of 20231 The soft landing thesis appears intact The jobs market is proliferating but these arent highpaying jobs that drive inflationary spending Furthermore upward wage pressure has come down meaning the job market strength is not exacerbating inflation The economic strength will likely lead to strength in Q3 earnings One positive sign is that companies are issuing guidance at the highest clip in five years and all else being equal more visibility means less price volatility particularly during earnings seasonWe often have a unique combination of robust economic data and consumer sentiment already at recessionary levels Recessions are usually preceded by exuberance and confidence not the perpetual fear and anxiety that leads to more conservative and rational economic decisionmaking in many cases In other words if you cut costs in anticipation of a recession but demand stays the same or increases you have likely just increased your margins This appears to be going on widely in the US economy2 The Q3 Earnings season is upon us When markets enter an earnings season the focus tends to shift from macro drivers and the Fed to the earnings report of respective companies And believe it or not despite all the hollering and moaning from bears about term premiums earnings estimates have ticked back up after declining in a wave of pessimistic sentiment earlier in the year But particularly after recent data showing better than forecast economic strength Im VERY optimistic about the upcoming earnings seasonBut there is another underappreciated factor in how earnings season affects the VIX even if it is a highly volatile one The VIX measures volatility at the index level Still during an earnings season  at the index level as it increases at the level of individual stocks so long as an allcorrelationsgotoone selloff does not occur In other words the fact that we are entering an earnings season in itself means that the VIX should naturally be suppressed3 Seasonal factors have flipped mainly from negative to positive The remainder of the year tends to see gains for the stock market Little factors like a slight bump from late tax returns should prove a countervailing force on the weakening bottom four quartiles of US consumers Yet the top quintile unlimited purse is somewhat of a countercyclical buoy Furthermore standard seasonal factors generally converge to produce good gains in the Fourth QuarterIn addition to the regular monthly seasonal strength another minor feather in the bullish cap is that this seasonality is augmented in odd years versus even years So many positive seasonal factors should converge in the markets favor There is always the possibility that abnormal events derail the seasonal trends but historical data is better than none in most instances4 The macroeconomic impact of the ArabIsraeli conflict particularly in the wake of the Yom Kippur War was multiplied by two factors The Cold War magnifying and intensifying the consequences of the conflict and the developed worlds dependence on foreignproduced oil Both of these items have changed The world is still far more globalized now than it was then despite recent and apparent setbacks to globalization The first significant change is that the US economy has become far less reliant on oil and is far more efficient in its use than when the ArabOil Embargo roiled global markets and the US economy in particularThe other significant change is that the US is now one of the worlds largest energy producers We consume a lot of our oil and even though the current administration has made some missteps on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Americas energy dominance means that any interruption in oil markets will affect our economy less US Energy exports hit a record in 2022It will also affect the global economy less While the energy sector has been a polarizing political issue if push came to shove and the United States faced economic ruin or dramatically increasing production it would likely choose the latter This is a different dynamic in the global economy than when ArabIsraeli issues badly affected prices and caused recession through energy shocks Thus one of the primary mechanisms through which volatility could affect markets is mitigated and I think energy prices will ultimately be more affected by The other reasons why I think continued VIX suppression is likely are all still intact and I think those more secular reasons will converge with the seasonal to produce a low fear index for the remainder of the year The most significant factor driving the suppression of the VIX is a matter of simple supply and demand There has been a mass proliferation of more precise and even more liquid alternatives to hedge against tail risk or singlestock risksI think you should use more precise tools that will give you more upside For instance the Limit Up Limit Down LULD rules for individual stocks will give you more upside than the marketwide circuitbreaker rules These rules have effectively diminished the kurtosis of the VIX or chopped off the tail colloquiallyStill despite these structural factors there is a massive demand for VIX calls implying that quite a few market participants disagree with my take Many risks could get worse than markets already know about I would include this as a comprehensive but not exhaustive list of the known risks currently stalking the marketI would also point out that my assumption of declining volatility into the end of the year largely rests upon an economic softlanding coming to fruition If economic activity declines rapidly or the lag effects of monetary policy cause a significant credit event then the VIX will spike and make this article look spectacularly wrong Nonetheless I think this is a lowprobability outcomeThe reason you want to buy VIX options instead of just using put options on your SPX position is because the VIX has more convexity The underlying is the implied volatility of the SP 500 not a security and implied volatility can spike quickly in a way that usually outpaces asset price moves But the postCOVID markets have been of a different character than usualThe Fed has guarded financial stability more than consensus thought possible and the US consumer has proven remarkably resilient Now that seasonal factors are favorable I dont think these realities will turn around on a dime The VIX also tends to decrease after inversion and briefly inverted on recent rate fearsOf course the main risk of shorting the VIX is getting blown out of the water by an unknown risk The Black Swan risks we cant know anticipate or sometimes even imagine will always be one of the most significant risks to shorting the VIX People often equate it to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller But in addition to seasonal factors being on your side shorting the VIX in the wake of inversions has an excellent track recordStill if you think about the physical limitations of this metaphorical task it is quite doable just like shorting the VIX However I think the data is mainly sending the allclear and survey and sentiment data show that people are in a frightful Halloween spirit This is a perfect condition for shorting the VIX in my estimationThey say markets climb a wall of worry and fall on a slope of hope When the inflation report came in white hot and Hamas attacked unprecedentedly markets sold off But then they climbed the wall of worry and closed the day higher While two anecdotal market occurrences dont make a trend I think they hint at how markets will respond into yearend aided by seasonal factors They will climb a wall of worry and the VIX will likely remain suppressed I am betting the recent spike just north of 20 was a local high until the end of the yearSo lets finish on ways to implement a short VIX There are a few options I will provide for folks with different skill levels risk tolerances and time horizons Ill also tell you which contracts Ive usedwill be using One of the points Ive made about VIX suppression involved the proliferation of more precise tools One tool that is a pretty easy way to short the VIX is a popular short shortterm VIX ETF offered by ProShares There are a lot of risks involved with this ETF and it wont perform like the VIX but if youre not used to trading options it is a good way to capitalize on a collapse of SPX Implied Volatility It is a highly shortterm instrument and you should monitor it daily Carefully consult the prospectus before using this tool and really do your homework Dont use it if you dont understand itMy preferred way of shorting the VIX is through VIX options I think you have a lot more control here with regard to theta decay and implied volatility As Ive mentioned the proliferation of 0DTE options has increased the agility of investors and enables you to squeeze a lot of alpha out of short periods So for me Ill experiment with a trade comprising both shortterm VIX options only eight days out complimented with longer duration options whose value is more supported by time value These guys can really pop if you catch the proverbial wind right of course the rapid time decay can also quickly vaporize capitalFor this higherrisk leg of my trade I purchased the  These options were very cheap around the close at  However this part of the position is negligible compared to the October 18th puts The theta decay is a doubleedged sword because of course if it goes against you your contract will quickly go to zero But on the other hand you have a very pure exposure to price movement This can serve its purpose but its like flying a helicopter in a hurricaneThus I like to balance my ultrarisky positions with little time to expiry with a longerdated option that is near or at the money For this particular trade given the recent spike in fear and negative sentiment I will purchase the  These last traded at respectively I will put tight stops on my riskier positions and looser ones with more time value This way I will prevent a total loss of capital if the VIX moves to higher levels   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular

304,Get An 8.3% Yield From Secure High-Quality REITs: RQI,We usually do not invest in closedendIn fact with the closedend fund Im going to present today this is once again the caseThe funds biggest holding is Prologis  For those of you who have been following closely my favorite industrial pick is Rexford  which is much smaller and has exposure to select geographies which have better supply and demand dynamics than the market at largeHowever this isnt the topic ofThe topic of todays article is the  So why would I consider this CEF and not anotherRQI uses leverage to invest in real estate investment trusts or REITs It currently has a 295 leverage ratio which means that for 1 in assets it invest 1295 in REITs As these securities pay dividends this increases the yield on the portfolio by 30 minus the cost of leverageThis allows RQI to pay out a 008 monthly distribution which is an 83 yield on its current 1146 priceAs such it is an interesting vehicle to generate a high yield while maintaining exposure to safer low and midyielding REITs as well see laterLeverage is a doubleedged sword On the way down a leveraged fund will see NAV erode fasterI believe now is an interesting time to initiate exposure to RQI because of my outlook for REITs over the next 618 months which I have shared in the past I think REITs have witnessed most of the pain they were going to endure and will soon swing back upAnalyzing a CEF is somewhat different than analyzing an equity We start our work with the prospectus which gives us everything we need to understand about the fund From there we of course need to do some cursory analysis of underlying holdings especially the larger ones and check diversification We compare the price to the NAV and historical discounts Finally we analyze distribution metrics making sure that the distribution isnt just a return of capital Ready to dig inRQI commits to investing at least 80 of its total assets in incomeproducing equity securities issued by highquality REITs These are REITs which show prospects for aboveaverage revenue and earnings growth and are identified based on criteria like earnings growth history debt to capital ratio and quality of managementThe balance is invested in corporate bonds and preferred shares of real estate companiesThis is potentially one of the most interesting parts of the equationFor it to keep working it would need interest rates to come down within 3 years which is the average term on its low fixed rate debt on which RQI pays 18Its average cost of financing is 26The Advisor charges a fee of 085 annually on the average daily managed assets of the fund A potential conflict of interest arises since this fee is based on managed assets which includes the funds use of leverage However the Board ensures transparency and protects shareholders interests by periodically reviewing the funds performance and its use of leverageIt is customary for funds to present the top 10 holdings RQI has 206 holdingsIn the case of RQI the top 10 holdings represent 50 of the portfolioIn my opinion it is somewhat reckless to ignore the other 50 of the portfolio but at the same time it is not necessary to analyze all 200 holdingsHere is the weight of the top x positions for RQIIt is quite clear that beyond the top 30 positions no individual position adds much to the portfolio nor deserves attentionHere are the top 30 positionsIve highlighted in bold the names which are covered by the DFTThe concentration of its top positions is quite similar to concentration within our model portfoliosIt is also worth mentioning that while the DFT covers 8 of the top 30 positions their weight within the fund represents no more than 20 of total assetsThis is actually quite good as it suggests that adding RQI would actually add diversification to our real estate exposure rather than creating leveraged redundancyIt is also interesting to note that they own MPW demonstrating that they are as able as we are to make mistakesFurthermore the risk section of the prospectus was quite good in summarizing the different risks of various real estate industriesHeres a short summary belowThe sheer variety of industries within REITs and their own idiosyncratic risks and opportunities shows why it is silly for the media to lump all real estate together when making assessmentsWhile all REITs have in common that they are spread businesses on the cost of capital and therefore impacted by higher interest rates the micro of each industry is just as importantWith RQI you get their managements preferences of being overweight or underweight certain industriesLets now look at how good a job theyve done in the pastBelow are the key current details concerning price and NAVThe 56 discount is greater than the oneyear average and looking at the chart below it is clear that it is a discount which is within a standard range for RQI but at the higher end Historically the price has been at a slight discount but as REITs have increased it has converged with NAVThis creates an extra 5 share price increase in upcoming yearsSince inception in 2002 NAV has grown at a 916 CAGR beating its blended benchmark and the SP 500 The share price has somewhat lagged but this is mostly a function of the NAV and share price disconnecting somewhatWhat is clear is that RQI through over two decades has performed extremely well as these returns are net of managements feesFinally what we want to make sure of is that the distributions arent frequently returns of capitalShort stints of capital returns have to be endured with CEFs when performance is below expectations but we do not want them to be the normSince 2010 only 3 months saw a return of capital from the distributions in the 4th quarter of 2020This is encouragingIt means that RQI is able to engineer its 83 yield through investing in very high quality REITs which yield a lot less thanks to an astute inclusion of leverage preffereds and bondsIve included the top 10 positions in a watchlist and as you can see none of them are very high yielding REITsCohen  Steers Quality Income Realty Fund seems to be a very well managed CEFIf like me you are bullish on REITs the extra leverage offers a great opportunity if REITs soar over the next 24 months as I expect them to doWe are setting a buy for Cohen  Steers Quality Income Realty Fund below 137 which ensures a yield above 7 and a sell above 18 which was the previous high and would be a good time to review the positionThe first thing you want to do is hit the orange follow button so we can

OfficerMarc Hesselink  INGRobert Sanders  Deutsche BankFrancoisXavier Bouvignies  UBSJanardan Menon  JefferiesRuben Devos  Kepler CheuvreuxGuy Sips  KBC SecuritiesHello and welcome to the Melexis Q3 2023 Results Call My name is Natalie and Ill be your coordinator for todays event Please note that this call is being recorded Operator InstructionsI will now hand you over to your host Marc Biron to begin todays conference Thank youThank you Dear audience thank you for joining the Melexis Earnings Call regarding the third quarter of 2023As always I will start with the business update after which our CFO Karen Van Griensven will comment on the financials We will answer your questions afterwardsSales in the third quarter of 23 came out with an increase of 5 compared to the previous quarter During the third quarter we observed that the order behavior of customers is coming back to a more historical pattern converging into a normalized order bookFor the last quarter of the year we expect limited growth because of the usual end of year inventory adjustmentsThe bestperforming product during Q3 were our motor drivers our magnetic sensor and our pressure sensor product a trend clearly driven by electrification and the need for more comfort and more safetyThe embedded motor drivers benefit from the gradual decarbonization of the car because they contribute to extend the range of the car They are extensively used in thermal management application in cabin and also in the powertrainThe other outperforming products are used in application increasing theThe size of the product as well as itsThe high safety level and the unique magnetic operation of the magnetic sensor are the main reason for the high demand of this magnetic sensor especially in the ebraking systemWe also had a very important success in Q3 with our temperature sensor because of renewed business in smart watches and also new business in smartphone The contactless temperature measurement and the very high accuracy of the device creates a lot of attractiveness for the Melexis temperature product familyIn the third quarter we also launched in the market new products For example the new current sensors which is a perfect fit for the EV battery management and also for the power distribution systemWe have also launched 2 ultralow power all effect switch which are ideal for IOT industrial and white goods applicationsBefore I give the floor to Karen for the financials I would like to remind our Capital Market Day on 14th of November We will be happy to welcome you in Ieper in Belgium where we will present our strategy our longterm financial targets as well as the product and application that will fuel our growth in the futureThank you Karen Ill give you the floorThank you Mark So welcome everybody So as mentioned already we came out with  486 million in the third quarter So 13 increase versus a year ago and 5 versus the previous quarter with a 3 negative impact of the euroUS dollar versus a year ago and no impact of the dollar versus the previous quarterThe gross result was  145 million or 461 of sales an increase of 16 compared to the same quarter of last year and an increase of 3 compared to the previous quarterRD expenses were at 107 of sales GA was at 48 of sales and selling was at 2 of salesThe operating result was  11 million or 286 of sales which is an increase of 16 compared to the same quarter of last year and an increase of 5 compared to the previous quarterThe net result was  68 million or  41 per share an increase of 16 compared to  88 million or  21 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and an increase of 9 compared to the previous quarterIf we look them ahead so Melexis expects sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 in the range of  47 million to  51 million So for the full year Melexis expects sales to increase around 15 a gross profit margin above 45 and an operating margin above 27 which was previously around 27 And all of this taking into account a euroUS dollar exchange rate of 105 for the remainder of the yearSo operator I would like to now open the QA session So please go aheadOperator Instructions Your first question goes to Marc Hesselink from INGYes Maybe the first question is on supply and demand You shared that number in the past that value that how much bigger the demand is versus supply Can you maybe share that again And also how you expect supply to ramp up over the course of 2024And my second question is on pricing Weve seen  most of your business is on longterm agreements but maybe youve also seen some price pressure in the business that not on longterm agreements So maybe can you talk around that and how you see that maybe impacting longterm agreements over the more longer termYes On the first question about supply and demand I think what we mentioned during the previous quarter is still valid I think for a large part of the business there is a better balance between supply and demand but we still have some pockets of business or some pocket of products that are still under allocation or under stressYes I want also to mention perhaps that it  given the lead time which is lets say 9 months before  between the order of the wafers and the delivery to customers Yes its not because we dont have supply constraint at Melexis level then the customer is not yet  not in constraint anymore because there is this delay I mean we need time to move the product from the supply chain to the customerIn terms of pricing your second question As you mentioned indeed yes part of the business is protected by LTA the longterm agreement that has been defined for 23 24 and 25 And  but its also as I mentioned lets say for the supply chain and also for the order behavior which is coming back to normal But there is also lets say kind of usual price discussion that is coming back also from part of the business But I would say yes we were well prepared in the past for such a discussion And we are preparing the same way for the discussion of today then I would say we are confident because we know how to deal it because we have dealt with this kind of discussion in the pastMaybe the second part of the first question the supply increases for 2024Sorry I forget it yes Yes we have together with our suppliers we are working to increase the supply And I think you have realized that the supply is increasing lets say quarter after quarter And for the part of business which is still under constraint the supply will continue to increase gradually in 2024Your next question comes from Robert Sanders from Deutsche BankYou sound pretty bullish on your TPMS opportunity Can you just talk a bit about what your market share goals are where your share is today And how your solution compares to the likes of Infineon NXP Schrader et cetera And I have a followupYes I think you mentioned in your question the competitor and I confirm those are the competitor Yes I would say its not that we are really bullish in the answer This is just the fact lets say we have some application ramping up at some customers And this is the result of the ramping upI mean we have the TPMS Its the second generation of TPMS And we have this product lets say available this version since this 3 4 years and now it is ramping up at a different customerGot it And in Ambient Lighting you didnt mention that as being strong Is there some digestion in Ambient Lighting And are you still supply constrained in Ambient LightingYes I think indeed we did not mention it because it did not grow a lot lets say in Q3 versus Q2 but its supply constrainedAnd are you losing share because you are supply constrained and others are like Elmos or not Or you dont recognize that statementYes we still have much more harder than what we can supplyOkay So when you say pockets of the business under stress its still quite a large part of your business that is still supply constrainedI think  no From a percentagewise its not a lot But indeed its correct that the indiscernible in the Ambient Lighting is part of them yesGot it And just last question just on the destocking Weve seen some other companies like eBlocks see quite major destocking because their lead times normalized Have you seen the destocking effect or what you call normalization in the backlog mainly in the products where lead times are kind of back to normal Or is it just  do you think customers have over ordered in the past and are now prepared to kind of normalize their inventoryNo I think its a bit  its a global across the different product portfolioDo you have another question Just to make sure we are still onlineCan you hear meYesHelloYes we hear youOkay I dont know I didnt hear anybody calling for me but Im online I was trying because of the quiet line So its Francois Bouvignies from UBSSo I have two quick ones So in your remarks Marc you talked about challenging geopolitical environment and softer electric softer EV demand You also talked about orders normalizationNow the question is when you look at your numbers in terms of revenue growth its actually growing still midteens I mean this quarter and next quarter So when you talk about the orders and softer EV demand does it mean that we will see that at a later stage because it doesnt seem that we see anything right now Your demand is still fairly strong Your revenue is very strong When you say that is it already impacting your revenuesSo in other words what youre seeing on the order behavior and EV demand is it something that we should forecast to impact a bit at a later stage lets say 2024 Is it fair to see that wayWe will not comment about 24 because usually we always give this commentNo Yes Im not asking for quantification guidance Im just talking about the mechanical around it because if you said that there is 9 months lead times between your order and your shipments if you see the orders changing right now it wouldnt mean based on what you said that we will see the impact 9 months later You see what I meanYes No I think you could see it The comment you could see them in the fact that yes we could have been I think better in Q3 and also in Q4 with all the headwind that you mentioned I think there is for sure yes some geopolitic challengeAs I mentioned and I think its public that the EV growth  is still growing a lot but lets say slower than anticipated I think in the  its clear for example in Belgium that OD has postponed lets say the release of the EV production in Brussels Its also clear that Tesla is reducing their price in order to keep the demand as high as possible And I think all of this may create the fact that we could have had a better Q3 and a better Q4 with all those headwinds But at the end we are still growingOkay So youre already seeing that this quarter or next quarter Can you quantify at all Or I mean any help around that What would have been without this slowdown the growth rate for exampleNo its difficult to say Its difficult to sayOkay The second question is on China So we know China has been pushing hard on the semiconductor side of things in many different areas One thing that is very difficult is on the magnetic sensor side I mean do you see any local Chinese competitors developing some solutionAnd maybe if you can tell us your exposure to the Chinese local market that would be great as well Yes thats kind of the China situation local competition if you see that ramping up and the size of local China pleaseYes But first in general there are indeed or there is indeed competition in China but its not only in China I mean we have competition everywhere Its correct that the competition is a bit magnified in China but its not that we dont know how to deal with competition We have competition in Europe We have competition in the US And also in China and as you mentioned I confirm that the competition in China is probably magnifiedBut as usual our answer to the competition is innovation I mean we have  we launch between 15 and 20 new products every year which are always innovative products And yes the strategy of Melexis is to avoid lets say the price battle and focus on the innovation which is also the case in ChinaAnd to answer your initial question about competition Yes we see I would say more and more competitor in China also for magnetic But those are lets say basic products and there are thanks to our innovation we can bring more value to the customers also with our magnetic product But its correct that the simple products are under competition in China but its not our core business lets say Our strategy is to bring to link innovationVery clear And the size of local China as a percentage of revenues can you help us quantify itOverall for Melexis its 25Well take our next question from Janardan Menon at JefferiesMy first question is on gross margins Your gross margin has been running quite strong right now and youve guided for more than 45 But to get to the 45 to 46 range would imply a gross margin decline quarteronquarterSo Im just wondering is your guidance conservative for the full year at 45 plus Or I mean what Im saying is could you have guided even at this 45plus mean also 46 plus Or is there any specific gross margin headwind that we should expect into Q4 Or any reason for gross margins to decline into Q4Well in general in this year gross margin is certainly in the first quarter because of inventory effect is actually artificially high So we know it will come down short or midterm to more normalized levels What it will be in Q4 is difficult to predict exactly But the general trend will be that it will be down from the levels that we see today because of the inventory effect that will gradually fade out So yesUnderstood And given that you referred to some inventory normalization correction et cetera would  should we also expect any kind of effect from  on the utilization at your testing facilities in the next 1 or 2 quartersWell the machine is running quite stable for the moment I dont expect major impact from that for the time beingOkay And then just going on to your comment in your opening remarks on youre seeing some normal end of the inventory adjustments into Q4 Is that more in the channel Is that at your sort of direct customers And what is the level of confidence that that is only going to be a Q4 phenomenon And it is truly just an endofyear seasonal situation and it will not continue into the first half of next yearYes Its what we see those adjustments and in the channel and in our customer on our Tier 1 I would say in the channel for the distributor we see that the inventory is stable even decreasing a bit For our customers we see that the inventory is growing and now stabilizing but it has grown during the previous months and quarters And we see indeed that they are adjusting their inventory towards the end of the year And this is why we really see the effect on those 2 inventoriesUnderstood And just last question for me On the  in the last couple of years youve always said that you are deprioritizing adjacent markets because the demand from automotive is so strong that you cant fulfill automotive demand and you are sort of giving higher priority to automotiveGiven that that situation may be changing a little bit which is automotive chips are coming out of shortage in most cases or in many cases and you did get this pickup in adjacent markets in Q3 Can we expect that if the automotive side does weaken more than you expect lets say in the next 6 months or so will you be able to cover that slack by shipping more into adjacent markets Or what Im trying to say is adjacent demand strong enough based on your new design wins like the smartphone win et cetera to compensate for that weakness right now based on your current visibilityIts difficult to answer because yes we dont know  the weakness that you mentioned we dont know what is the level of the weakness But its correct that the capacity being increased and indeed some adjustment that we  in the inventory that we see Its correct that then we can give more volume to the adjacentAnd for sure its a goal of Melexis to balance one with the other that we have indeed  we are working now indeed to move some capacity towards adjacent And we see that yes in some application the adjacent application We see some traction of those applicationsYou mentioned the temperature sensors but we see it in also other domainWell now move on to our next question from Ruben Devos at Kepler CheuvreuxIve got just 1 following up on the temperature sensor which you just mentioned I believe this will be included in the Pixel 8 Pro smartphonesCould you talk a bit more about the prospect that this could potentially be included in other highend smartphones as well in your view And given the expected volumes of the Google Pixel smartphones it appears like this could be somewhat of a meaningful contributor to your sales Could you talk a bit about how material this could be for youYes The Google smartphone is  I mean its not lets say the most popular smartphone and how much more popular smartphone Its also on the highend version of the phone Then yes I think its a good success for Melexis because we have proved to the market that we have a product which fits the smartphone requirementIn terms of volume it is not fantastic I mean its for sure good volume And for sure we welcome those volumes but its  I repeat those are not as popular phone as other phone But for us its really important that we have proved to the market that we can make it and achieve this fully compatible with the expectationOkay And then just more generally I was wondering like if you think about maybe the sales new car sales these days of lets say 15 for petroelectric vehicles and 85 other How would you think about your split in automotive with your share of salesIts difficult to answer because we have many products that are agnostic to the split between ICE and battery cars We have lets say 50 of the product is agnostic to this And then the other 50 is indeed split between battery and ICEI dont know Karen if you know the split but I dont know exactly how we could mention the splitBetween the ICE and battery Yes well the majority is indeed agnostic And yes we go more and more to an equal split in what is specific And gradually EV has taken the overhand so its a gradual process But its the minority of our business that is  so all in all we are not very sensitive to the move  to the speed of the move to EV or ICE in generalYes I can add that from a design win perspective it is clear that the very vast majority of the design win are for either the agnostic or the battery powertrain But yes there is very very limited number of design wins for ICE because clearly the OEM focused their development on the electric cars and they dont develop a new application or almost no new application for the ICEOkay And if I just can come back on the temperature sensor very quickly You mentioned its not  they dont really have high market share Google within the overall smartphone marketBut do you see like  do you see theres any possibility of you also making inroads into selling to other handset manufacturers Youve had this win Its a niche feature so far But do you see more opportunity hereI think we are working on different opportunities in the smartphone but also in other wearables And we believe indeed that this temperature sensors can add value on those wearable But for the time being from the smartphone perspective except for Google I mean I dont have anything to mentionWell move on to our next question from Guy Sips of KBC SecuritiesCan you update us on the situation in the Malaysian factory So the  is it still  are you still working on a  0 million investment and that the new building is expected to be completed by the end of this year Are you speeding it up and trying to get it finished earlier Whats the situation over thereWe are still on plan And that means that production will be ready by yearend So well move early next year into the production facilityThe office building will be finalized in Q1 So that will be still part of the investment in  for next year but the majority will be done by the yearend as was planned in the beginning of the yearAnd its still the  0 million in the next 5 years that is expectedThe overall investment yes thats in that range of which half is more or less the facilityThats good news in general I think that we managed to have a speedy execution in MalaysiaAnd in return well get more capacityOperator Instructions There are no further questions so Ill hand it back to Mr Marc to complete this conference Thank youThank you To close the conference I would like to thank you for the questions Im looking forward to discuss again in FebruaryBut before that I would like to remind our Capital Market Day on 14 of November And again wed be happy to welcome you in Ieper in Belgium and to listen to our longterm strategy longterm financial targets Also wed like to present the product and the application that will grow our future And of course we could have  take the opportunity lets say to discuss during the break or during the lunch on more informal way Thank youThis concludes this call Thank you for your participation You may now disconnect,0,2023-10-25,0
306,A-Mark Precious Metals: Unexpected Way To Bet On Gold,The gold prices at the decades end will exceed 4000 oz To benefit from the gold bull run the market offers multiple instruments We can choose between bullion and gold ETFs or jump into the rabbit hole and buy mining shares AMark PreciousAMark is a diversified service provider in the precious metals trading industry The company has a robust balance sheet with sufficient liquidity The companys revenue and gross profit margins have consistently risen for the last eight years AMarks managers and directors are significant shareholdersI give AMark a strong buy rating because it offers excellent business at a steep discount supported by macro tailwindsWe live in exciting times Uncertainty arises in geopolitics and the macroeconomy Precious metals love such an environment They benefit from the disorder as Taleb would call them they are antifragile The gold price has been rising since the beginning of the century It reached twice peak levels in 2011 and 2022 and in the meantime moves in a wide rangeThe fundamentals are lined up to fuel another leg of the gold bull market The economic metrics such as growing M2 aggregate and rising debt to GDP drive the longterm demand On the other hand the supply is constrained by a lack of CAPEX and the approaching  New Tier 1 deposits have not been discovered and developed for the last decade My scenario is initially for the gold price to reach the  2200  2500 range in the next 24 months However by the decades end we might see the gold priced beyond 4000 ozThe demand for precious metals is forecasted to grow by 91CAGR till 2029 The chart below from  illustrates the growth specificsIn all segments the demand will increase at a similar rate Globally the market is concentrated in North America and Europe The newcomers as MENA and LATAM states still lag behind the Far East and the Western world However at a fast rate they compensate for the delay The chart below from  shows ETF gold holding by regionThe progress made by Asia and Europe in the last 17 years is apparent Another overlooked process illustrating the rising gold demand is the COMEX deliveries They have been rising steadily over the previous five years The chart below shows the trendThe consistency is impressive The 12month average has been significantly higher than in the past two decades For the last several years the Central Banks across the globe have also been active participants in precious metal markets They have increased their gold reserves with regular purchases Many European Central Banks  to be repatriated from Feds custody to their vaultsAMark is a diversified service provider in the precious metals trading industry The image below from the last corporate  shows the company operationsAMark has a few revenue streamsAMark sells wholesale goods to merchants and institutional customers Historically wholesale segment margins averaged over 2 compared to less than 1 Due to the enormous supply and demand variations predicting margins from quarter to quarter is challengingWhat I like about AMark is its expansion in precious metals retail sales The everyday investors has started to realize the importance of owning gold and silver The pandemic was the catalytic event All bullion dealers were short of inventories AMark made acquisitions thus reaching a more extensive customer base JM Bullion the largest precious metals retailer in the US is included in its portfolio and Silver Gold Bull is one of the largest in CanadaCyber Metals is a platform developed by AMark and JMB The quote below from the companys announcement briefly explains Cyber MetalsIn my opinion the app will significantly improve AMarks customer reach It will attract Gen Z customers who are techsavvy Longterm Cyber Metals might turn into another established revenue stream for AMarkThe directors and managers own company shares The image below from  illustrates the large shareholdersInvesting means trusting the companys managers No skin in the game says a lot to me AMark is an excellent example of high ownership among managers and directorsAMark has strong financials The table below shows the companys liquidity and solvency metrics The data is from the companys The numbers are good enough for me A Mark is not overloaded with debt and has enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations The image below shows the companys balance sheetA few things I like about that business model The first is the domination of liquid assets The company owns  645 million in inventories exrestricted inventories They could easily be liquidated without steep discounts hurting the companys solvency Intangibles and goodwill constitute 10 of AMarks assets Both are difficult to quantify hence our NAV estimate could be far off It is nice to see such prudent levels in servicebased businessOn the liabilities side the company does not hold longterm debt It uses product financing agreements and revolving credit lines to fund its operations Both provide flexibility and could be withdrawn when neededThe revenues have been rising for the last three years The SGA expenses came up too due to inflation pressures The company earnings are still below the levels of 2021 due to the increased expensesThe last numbers are not an exception The company has managed to grow its yearly revenues for eight years The chart below shows the companys line since its IPO in 2014It is impressive to see the growing revenues have been translated into higher margins and EPS As discussed above efficient acquisitions were a primary driver expanding the companys ability to cross and upsell its productsThe table above illustrates company profitability metrics The data is from the  Q2 2023 The margins are very low in the precious metals trading industry AMark management has done a great job gradually increasing the gross profit margin from 04 in 2015 to 35 in 2023 Net income per employee has improved too for the same period Those numbers are a substantial achievement in a challenging environment for precious metals pricesAMark traditionally distributes dividends The image below shows dividend metricsIt maintains a low payout ratio which is a positive sign That means the company can maintain its dividend policy without adversely affecting its liquidity Another benefit is quarterly distribution and dividend growthAt this point I will calculate the intrinsic value of AMark For this purpose I use a 2 Stage Discounted Free Cash Flow Model by Professor Damodaran For equation inputs I use his  and Seeking AlphaAssumptions and inputsThe above parameters are inputs in the following steps1 Calculate Levered Beta with the formula below2 Calculate the discount rate discount rate as the cost of equity using the resulting value for leveraged beta The formula I use is3 Stage 1 I calculate the present value of discounted free cash flows for ten years using 2024 and 2025 FCF estimates from  I assume the FCF will grow at a stable rate of 224 Stage 2 Calculate the Terminal Value of the free cash flows over ten years at stable growth into perpetuity g and the resulting discount rate Then calculate the present value of the Terminal Value5 Sum the final results of stage 1 and stage 2 Their sum is called the Total Equity Value TEV6 Divide the TEV by the total number of companyissued shares The result is the intrinsic value of the acacia which I compare against the current market priceFor AMark I get the following resultsLevered Beta  12Discount Rate  82Total Equity Value   1196000000Total shares outstanding  23000000Intrinsic value per share   520Current market price   3580 as of Sept 07 2023To value AMark is difficult because its competitors are not public companies I will weigh AMark against its peers from Specialized Finance Acacia Research ACDG and SWK Holdings  and midsize gold miners Hecla Mining Company  and Coeur Mining  The latter have an assetheavy business model and carry a lot of risk not inherent for AMark While specialized finance companies might have clean balance sheets they differ widely in business modelsRatios with sales in the denominator are useless for valuing AMRK because precious metals services have singledigit gross margins unlike specialized financiers or gold miners I use PB and PE in that case despite their drawbacks The latter is the most unreliable of all the metrics Too often the earnings are subject to accounting gimmicks The book value especially for AMark could be estimated with a high degree of certainty because the company holds precious metals cash and derivatives with exposure to precious metals in its balance sheetAMark is undervalued compared to financiers and miners based on all PE ratios while using PB the company is overvalued In conclusion the company offers a 30 margin of safety based on DCF calculations  a rare occurrence for such a highquality businessAMark carries the following risks economic liquidity credit and operational risk The financial risk is related to interest rates and rising bond yields The chart below shows the correlation between gold prices and 10year US Treasury real yields invertedBoth variables are inversely correlated The gold is down when the yields are up and vice versa But that is a too simplistic explanation We subtract the inflation from the nominal rates to obtain the actual rates The current decade will be dominated by structural inflation ZIRP will remain in the past and the correlation between the rates and gold prices will become more insignificantAs seen on the chart for the first time since 2019 we have positive real yields During that period gold has been moving in a large consolidation It broke unsuccessfully twice the resistance at 2000  per ounce during the pandemic in 2020 and April 20222AMark is exposed to liquidity and credit risk because it is involved in precious metals landing and funds its operations with revolving credit lines The liquidity risk is the inability of the borrower to cover its debt obligations on time AMark is highly liquid thus significantly reducing the liquidity riskThe credit risk is the companys counterparties inability to pay its debts AMark has a portfolio of loans valued at 100 million on 30 June 2023 The table below shows the loan structureThe company has sufficient buffer because the collateral for bullion is 75 and for numismatics it is 65 Loan to Value LTV On the other hand AMarks borrowers are exposed to lower default riskConsidering the diverse operations included in the AMark portfolio the operational risk is a factor we cannot ignore Unfortunately we can quantify and mitigate its impact Operational risk is related to the companys processes which depend on leadership capabilities and corporate cultureAMark is a solid business Mr Market offers for 70 cents per dollar It has a clean balance sheet a proven track record in consistently growing revenues and managers with skin in the game The macro tailwinds line up for a longterm gold bull market Being a precious metal merchant AMark will benefit significantly while offering downside protection unlike the gold

307,The Apartment Sector: Increasing Demand For Affordable Living,In this paper we will focusOver the past 12 months demand for apartments has remained near record levels across key strategic markets and vacancy rates are well within their equilibrium rangesStrong rent growth since the start of the pandemic has continued to fuel impressive NOI growth as leases have continued to roll up to market asking rentsSinceIf there has been a question mark regarding the apartment sector in both regions it has been the high levels of development In the US the pace of new deliveries has pushed vacancy rates up toward their long term historical averages for institutionally managed properties Exhibit 1Recent supply and demand trends may be somewhat misleading however Despite an increasing number of projects that are under construction apartment units have been underdelivered over the past decadeConsequently there has been a shortage of housing which has resulted in an affordability crisis in many major cities for both the rental and forsale marketsIn the US for example Exhibit 2 left chart shows that since 1990 only 25 new multifamily units have been built for every thousand households  well below the average of 64 between 1960 and 1990In Europe as well right chart construction permits issued for residential dwellings have yet to recover to their preGlobal Financial Crisis GFC levelsMost major markets in the US and Europe are now facing a housing deficit with many needing more units to accommodate population growth than are currently being supplied In fact a research report from Freddie Mac  a US government sponsored entity founded to provide liquidity to the residential sector  recently stated the US needs an additional 38 million housing units to meet current demand growthIn Europe the construction of new residential buildings is also unable to keep up with demand The German Property Federation for example has reported that the deficit of housing in the country has reached its highest level in 20 years and that by 2025 the shortage may increase to 700000 flatsAs a result across both sides of the Atlantic the outlook for current landlords and developers remains positive and suggests that secular demand through demographics will provide a steady flow of new renters looking for space While all property sectors rely on demographics as a primary demand driver the residential housing sector especially apartments has an outsized reliance on population growth in prime renter age groupsOf particular importance is the shape of the population pyramid which dictates where demand falls Other important factors in conjunction with demographics are cultural norms that impact household formation and homeownership trends across regionsIn the US and Europe a majority of households own their homes Homeownership rates can vary greatly by country however with Romania having the highest rate of home ownership at 953 and Germany the lowest at 491Such high homeownership rates among Eastern European nations are an artifact of the rapid shift from planned to marketbased economics in the early 1990sDue to the fiscal stress placed upon most former Eastern Bloc nations tenants were offered a chance to purchase the dwellings in which they lived at low prices from the governmentWhen we take into consideration amenities and quality of dwellings high homeownership rates in these countries should not necessarily indicate a lack of demand for newer and higherquality rental unitsRather in many Eastern European nations the relatively poor quality of existing housing stock could offer an interesting entry point for developers to provide more modern and highly amenitized apartment communitiesIf we look more broadly at the demographics associated with the rental population base we establish that in both the US and Europe it is quite largeIf we include the UK there are roughly 357 million households in these regions of which 321 are renters meaning there are nearly 115 million rental householdsThe population trend charts suggest that in addition to existing rental households there is an ample pool of renters that can provide increasing demand over the next decadeMillennials  those aged 27 to 42  remain a dominant population group in both the US and Europe accounting for 20 of the population Including Generation Z the primerenter age group expands to nearly 40While the US and Europe are getting older with median ages of 38 and 44 years old respectively younger generations have officially taken over from the Baby Boomers Exhibit 4Young adults living with parents are another source of untapped demand In many countries young adults are living at home longer than ever before Data from the US Census and Eurostat shows that between 2010 and 2022 the last year of available data the share of young adults has increasedIn the US for example people in the potential renter category living at home increased from 30 in 2010 to 314 in 2022 which represents roughly one million additional individuals who could form households and increase the demand for apartment units over the next few yearsIn Europe the share of young adults living at home is structurally higher but has also increased over the past decade More recently though the share of young adults living at home has started to decline particularly postpandemic which will help drive demand for apartment units over the next cycleAlthough the decision for young adults to live at home may be driven by numerous considerations including cultural and social norms family ties and structural factors it is also increasingly the case that affordability is becoming a larger issueWhile affordability cuts across all segments of the residential sector the current interest rate environment is both a blessing and a curse for the rental market Monetary policy in the US and Europe is very restrictiveIn the US for example the 30year fixed mortgage rate  the most popular financial options for homeowners  has increased to over 7 adversely affecting home price affordability particularly for firsttime home buyers looking for an accessible entry point into the forpurchase marketHistorically housing affordability has been dictated by a simple rule of thumb that allows a potential home buyer to estimate affordability as a house price of roughly three times their annual incomeThis has generally held up when applied to the median household when mortgage rates conform to spreads at equilibrium longterm rates Nearly a decade of extraordinarily accommodative policy has rendered that relationship uselessHouse pricetoincome ratios in the US and the UK for example have increased to roughly 55 due to exceptionally low interest rates following the GFC and again during the COVID19 pandemicIn the US for example the median price of an existing house was 284488 in December 2019 with an average commitment rate on a 30year fixed rate mortgage of 37Today in the US the median house price is roughly 400000 Put another way the rise in both interest rates and prices has increased the average payment for a home buyer by about 1200 per monthThe apartment sector to date has been a primary beneficiary of pricing increases within the singlefamily forpurchase market in both the US and Europe Just following the pandemic US markets saw net absorption in 2022 of 627 msf which exceeded the prior record by more than 200 msfThe net result was a tightening of the market that saw apartment rents increase by 21 between 2020 and 2022 and with it a decline in overall affordabilityIn the US the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD defines affordable housing as housing on which the occupant pays no more than 30 of gross income including utilitiesIn the US roughly 25 of markets we track would be deemed either unaffordable or at risk solely based on average asking rent and median household incomes across metro areas Exhibit 7On the other side of the Atlantic statistics from Eurostat revealed that 50 of market renters spent at least 40 of their income on housing in the European Union in 2021Although more recent figures are not yet available the spike in the cost of living and the rise in rents that occurred over the last year and a half have certainly worsened the average housing overburden rate as nominal wages failed to keep up with rampant inflationIn Greece and the Netherlands for example renters spend more than 30 of the income on housing Across most European capitals renting a onebedroom flat in a central location can easily exceed the average workers salary The erosion of apartment affordability amid tight market conditions and strong rental increases recently has presented a quandary for many investors While apartment rental values remain attractive relative to home ownership they continue to stress household balance sheets on a practical basisPortfolio managers looking to increase their allocation to the living sector and apartments are increasingly cognizant of rising cost pressures particularly when it impacts new demand and tenant retentionWhile data on affordability are ample hard data on the affordable housing markets performance are more nuanced and elusive Many investors have multiple terms and definitions of what they deem to be affordable and there exists no hard benchmark for performanceUsing HUDs definition of no more than 30 of a households budget as a guideline for affordability we can calculate the threshold for an affordable unit At the median household income of 74580 for 2022 in the US the limit for an affordable unit would be 1854 per monthInvestors using a range around median household income of between 60 to 120 which is typical in the industry today would be able to target households with incomes between  45000 to  90000 This translates into a rental range of between of 1120 to 2240 per monthIn the US the national average for an institutionally managed twobedroom unit is near the top of the affordable range Fortunately within the US and Europe there is a wide disparity between regions and apartment formats that provide investors with diversityWe suggest that investors focus on matching households in the middle of the income distribution with appropriately priced rentals In the US the middle of the household income distribution as shown in Exhibit 9 ranges from 50000 to 150000 and represents 44 of all households and creates a very meaningful investment opportunity to serve By focusing on middleincome households and diversifying investment portfolios across regions where apartment rents are more affordable investors can ensure the ability to retain tenants and push moderate rent increases thereby ensuring solid NOI growth and ultimately capital appreciation While there is a decided lack of performance data for affordable or moderately priced housing the literature suggests that such a strategy can offer both higher returns and lower volatility over timeA recent research paper Moderate Income Rental Housing Its Viability as an Asset Class for Real Estate Investment with Environmental Social and Governance Criteria used NCREIF data to estimate the performance of moderately priced rental properties against other segments of the NPI Apartment index as well as comparing those results across other sectorsIt found that between 2011 and 2021 moderately priced apartment properties produced a 93 return outpacing all other major property sectors except for industrial Exhibit 104 The study can provide investors with some perspective and confidence as they look to increase exposure to the apartment sectorThe apartment sector in both the US and Europe continues to benefit from several structural tailwinds that are reshaping the way individuals live Shifting dynamics within housing affordability and the distribution of income and wealth should provide the sector with a steady pace of demand over the coming decadesAs the younger generations take over to become the dominant demographic groups in both size and spending power we believe that investors should focus on the needs and desires of this growing pool of potential rentersThe economic climate will dictate that investors focus on underserved segments of the income distribution which will provide a stable renter base amid lower levels of affordability in the forpurchase market in both the US and EuropeShortages of rental units are also driving rents to unsustainable levels in many US and European cities thereby forcing many younger people to live at home longerThis has created a pool of untapped demand for the apartment market particularly for affordable or moderately priced units We believe that investors should concentrate on these underserved

308,Looking Towards Rate Cuts In 2024,"The technology sector led a rebound in the major market averages yesterday but there was not a lot of participation from the remaining sectors and the Russell 2000 smallcap index closed modestly lower There were no economic reports to trade on which is whyWhen a soft landing for the US economy can be confirmed by Fed officials which I think occurs during the first half of 2024 we should start to see a normalization of shortterm rate policy That means moving from the currently restrictive stance to one that is neutral meaning rates are neither restrictive nor stimulative While this may be a highly subjective number Chairman Powell has suggested that it approximately 35 The soft landing will come into view onceBased on Fed funds futures the consensus of investors is expecting the first rate cut at next years May meeting That would lower the target rate from a range of 52555 to 500525 I think rate cuts will start sooner than that because I see the core rate of inflation falling faster than the consensusShelter costs have been putting more upward pressure on core inflation than any other category and accounted for 90 of the CPI increase in the month of July This is because it takes a full 12 months for new rental rates to work their way through the annualized number which stands at approximately 8 As the chart below clearly shows when the newest rental rates are factored into the annualized number we should see a precipitous fall in shelter inflation by May of next year The market will anticipate the rate cuts to come based on this disinflationary development and the bull market should continue to broaden and mature between now and then as a resultThe inflation hawks are saber rattling about rising energy prices today which they assert will force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer if not continue to tighten monetary policy First the Feds focus is on the core rate which excludes food and energy prices Both are subject to dramatic price swings which the Fed has little control over The movement in the price of oil over the short to intermediate term has more to do with the speculative activities of futures traders than real world supply and demand Therefore it is futile to try and manage it with monetary policy Second rising energy prices is a form of tighter monetary policy on consumption which self resolves over timeAs this bull market broadens and strengthens and sentiment gradually improves I will become more keenly focused on what can go wrong rather than what is already going right There is a big difference between a pause to refresh 35 a correction 10 or more and a bear market 20 or more The first is an opportunity The second is a more painful opportunity that requires more defensive action The last necessitates a shift to wealth preservation This still feels like a pause that has yet to complete itself If the facts change then so will my outlookLots of services offer investment ideas but few offer a comprehensive topdown investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense That is how compliments other services that focus on the bottomups security analysis of REITs CEFs ETFs dividendpaying stocks and other securities  Lawrence Fuller has been managing portfolios for individual investors for 30 years starting his career at Merrill Lynch in 1993 and working in the same capacity with several other Wall Street firms before realizing his longterm goal of complete independence when he founded Fuller Asset Management  Lawrence Fuller is the Principal of Fuller Asset Management FAM a state registered investment adviser Information presented is for educational purposes only intended for a broad audience The information does not intend to make an offer or solicitation for the sale of purchase of any specific securities investments or investment strategies Investments involve risk and are not guaranteed FAM has reasonable belief that this marketing does not include any false or material misleading statements or omissions of facts regarding services investment or client experience FAM has reasonable belief that the content as a whole will not cause an untrue or misleading implication regarding the advisers services investments or client experiences Past performance of specific investment advice should not be relied upon without knowledge of certain circumstances or market events nature and timing of investments and relevant constraints of the investment FAM has presented information in a fair and balanced manner FAM is not giving tax legal or accounting advice

309,Strong EV Sales Growth Forced Exxon Mobil To Enter The Lithium Business,After a strong year in 2022  and the United States is arguably the fastestgrowing market in the worldThat new market reality has apparently left an impression on some of theAt the end of July news broke that  to supply lithium to some of the worlds largest EV manufacturers such as     and  This news follows another report that  with the intent of potentially mining and processing lithium in that region While still in the early stages the facility could pump out as much as 100000 tons of processed lithium annuallyThis part of Arkansas is viewed as strategically important because it falls within the SmackoverIf Exxon successfully launches a new USbased lithium operation that would significantly boost domestic supplies of this key global resource Lithium has been critically undersupplied in recent years as EV manufacturing has expanded rapidly around the worldCurrently the worlds largest producers of lithium include Australia Chile China Argentina and BrazilAs part of the companys Q2 earnings call CEO of Exxon Darren Woods said that brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries and chemical plants and in fact in some of our upstream operationsExxon hasnt yet said if it would develop the Arkansas facility on its own or potentially partner with another company that has specific expertise in lithium miningprocessingExxons aspiration to be a major player in the global lithium market is clearly growing by the dayespecially if the longtime oil giant is already talking to EV manufacturers about future supply dealsAnd Exxon isnt hurting for cash The company booked roughly 7 billion in profits during Q2 2023 and has a long history of putting extra capital to workOn July 13 Exxon acquired   for 49 billion Denbury specializes in carbon capture utilization and storage CCS as well as enhanced oil recovery Last year Exxon also acquired a 50 stake in Biojet AS which is a Norwegian biofuel companyEarlier this year the  reported that   of   a large American fracker in the Permian Basin However based on the recent Denbury acquisition the PXD deal may have temporarily been moved to the back burnerBased on Exxons new foray into the lithium market its entirely possible the company may elect to acquire a lithium minerprocessor at some point in the future as wellWith a market capitalization of roughly 440 billion  and can certainly pay to play in the lithium sector if it so choosesExxon has likely been exploring strategic alternatives in the lithium sector for some time but may have gotten more serious in 2023 due to the recent correction in lithium pricesConsidering the companys long history of success the leadership at Exxon is keenly aware that its preferable to buy low and sell high as opposed to vice versaLithium pricesalong with the prices of many other global commoditiesspiked during the COVID19 pandemic but have dropped sharply since October of last yearFrom August 2021 to October 2022 lithium prices rallied from roughly 15000ton all the way to 85000ton However from October of last year through today lithium prices have corrected by about 55 and are currently trading around 35000tonThe recent drop has been attributed to several factors including the recent slowdown in the Chinese economy as well as increased global supplies of this key resourceChina is currently the largest market for global EV sales and boasts the worlds largest domestic fleet of EVs with over half of the worlds electric vehicles currently domiciled in the Middle KingdomChinas economy had been expanding after the country scrapped most of its COVID19 restrictions at the end of 2022 But the economy in China has sputtered in recent weeks as manufacturing activity in the country has steadily weakenedIn addition to a weakening Chinese economy lithium prices have also been fighting against rising global supplies of this key material Lithium production was extremely limited just a few years ago but global capacity has expanded significantly in the last two yearsNew supplies are coming online in China this year and in the next couple of years some big mines in North America and South America are expected to come onlineFor the time being declining lithium prices have certainly helped make EVs more affordable which may be a key reason sales of EVs continue to rise in 2023In June of this year  that new EVs were selling for about 20 less than they were 12 months ago on average And some of that decline was undoubtedly linked to falling lithium prices the supply and demand dynamics in the lithium market will continue to drive prices for the remainder of 2023 and beyond Moreover the prevailing price of lithium will continue to heavily influence how much it costs to build an EVTo track and trade the lithium sector readers can add the following tickers to their watchlistsEditors

310,The Next Big Short - Junk Bonds,Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates  as interest rates increase bond prices fall Thus a bet on higher interest rates can be executed by shorting bonds or bond ETFsBut whatThe basic formula for bond yields is as followsNominal yields  Real yields  Inflation Expectations  Credit Risk  Liquidity premium  Maturity premiumTreasury Bonds issued by the US Government are considered to be Riskfree meaning the Credit risk is essentially 0 Further Treasury Bonds have been the most liquid asset globally thus Liquidity premium is also 0Thus Treasury Bond yields are affected only by 1 Real rates and 2 Inflation expectations relative to other bonds with the same maturityThe nominal yield on a 10year Treasury Bond has increased over the last 6 months from around 33 to 449 as the chart below shows What caused the increase in the nominal yieldThe increase in the nominal yield on the 10Year Treasury Bond has been primarily driven by the increase in the real interest rate As the chart below shows the real rate as estimated by the yield on the 10year Treasury Inflation Protected Security TIPS has almost doubled over the last 6 months increasing from just above 1 to 207Inflation expectations estimated as the Breakeven Inflation have been relatively stable over the last 6 months in a 2324 rangeThus its the real yield that is pushing the nominal yield higher What is causing the increase in real yieldsThe real yields respond to the supply and demand for Treasury Bonds and can also be used as a monetary policy by the Fed Specifically the Fed can buy Treasury Bonds via QE to stimulate the economy by making real yields negative The Fed can also remove the monetary policy stimulus by selling Treasury Bonds via QT which can push the real yields higherRecently the Fed has been implementing the QT which can explain the rise in real yields from 1 to 2 over last yearHowever it was the Bank of Japan monetary policy tweak in July to allow long term rates to reach 1 that triggered the recent rise in the Treasury real rates given the expectations that Japanese investors would start selling US Treasury Bonds Note the Japanese investors are the largest holders of US TreasuriesFurther the US Government is running an unsustainable fiscal deficit which has been increasing the supply of Treasuries  at the time when the demand is weakening The July Treasury auctions were weak which added to the price pressure and lifted the real yieldsGiven the rising US Treasury nominal yields the iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond ETF  has dropped by 14 over the last 6 monthsIn fact during this period many investors revealed their short bets on US Treasury Bonds for example the But what about Corporate Bonds especially the Junk bonds Based on the valuation formula above the nominal Junk bonds yields are also pricing the Credit risk or the risk premium in addition to the real yields and inflation expectationsStinkingly as TLT dropped by 14 over the last 6 months the iShares iBoxx  High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  remained essentially flat falling by only 005How to explain the relative overperformance of HYG over TLT over the last 6 months as the chart below showsObviously the recent episode of rising real rates did not increase credit risk for junk bonds But more importantly the increase in real yields did not affect the junk bonds which actually means that the credit risk premium actually decreased over the last 6 monthsDid we witness a flight to safety to Junk Bonds over the last 6 monthsIn fact the interest rate spread between the BBB rated bond yields one notch above the junk and the 10Year Treasury Bond yields has been narrowing from 23 to current 166 which is the lowest level since 2007The recent overperformance of Junk bonds HYG over Treasury Bonds TLT is likely an inefficiency  and HYG is likely to fall sharply over the next 12 months in absolute terms and relative to TLTFirst the increase in real interest rates is increasing the probability of a recession given that a rise in real yields is a monetary policy tightening tool  designed to slow the demand by reducing investment  and thus cause a recession to tame inflation The Fed has not indicated a timetable to stop the QTSecond the increase in nominal yields increases the probability of a credit crunch as the higher yields meet the wave of the corporate bond refinancing needs in 2024 and beyond This is directly related to the unfolding Commercial Real Estate crisis which is likely to be the next shoe to dropThus Credit Risk is likely to sharply spike over the near term as the higher real yields trigger a recession and the likely wave of corporate defaults Thus HYG is a prime short at these levels and given the recent overperformanceNote according to Seeking Alpha HYG has 47 short interest which means that it is already a heavily shorted ETF  the big short on Junk bonds is already in place but it has not worked yetThe softlanding narrative is possibly continuing to support the Junk bond prices and keeping the credit spreads tight Thus the Junk Bond short might need a trigger that invalidates the softlanding narrative a data point that confirms a recessionary scenarioWhats in HYGHYG is well diversified ETF with 1207 junk bond holdings These are the top 10 junk bonds in HYG totaling just above 4   Past

311,Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,We are pleased to provide you with the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Funds  the Fund  report for the quarter ended September 30 2023 For the first nine months of the calendar year the Fund generated a return of 215 after fees versus 412 before fees for the Funds most relevant benchmark the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Developed IndexThe primary contributors to performance during the quarter included certain USbased real estaterelated businesses FNF Group and UHaul Holding Company and international real estate operating companies Wharf Holdings and Berkeley Group Notwithstanding these gains were more than offset by detractors during the quarter which primarily included the Funds investments in areas that are perceived to be more economically sensitive such as real estate services CBRE Group and JLL and homebuilding Lennar Corp and DR Hortondespite these businesses possessing superstrong balance sheets and prospects to gain significant market share over timeEven though the Fund has outperformed its most relevant benchmark more recently Fund Management maintains the view that the strategys longterm results are the most relevant scorecard To that end the Fund has generated an annualized return of 793 after fees since its inception more than twentyfive years ago As a result this performance indicates that an initial investment of 100000 in the Fund would have a market value in excess of 675000 assuming distributions had been reinvested or more than the same 100000 would be worth had it been placed into a passive mutual fund tracking the Funds aforementioned benchmark as well as the SP 500 over the same time period Further perspective on the key drivers of this performance are included herein along with more details on the Funds additions to Sun Communities Inc and Big Yellow plc and overall portfolio positioningAt the end of July the Office of Debt Management at the Department of the US Treasury provided its to the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee TBAC  Within the presentation TBAC was provided with an overview of various items including the Treasurys recent financial results certain forecasts and recommendations on financing Most notably though the Office of Debt Management revised certain figures from the previous quarter and projected that the Treasurys current annual deficit which is amongst the largest on record as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product would largely be maintained for the next decade In addition TBAC received the recommendation that the Treasury fund these shortfalls by increasing its issuance of longerdated US Treasury Notes Alongside these revelations the capital markets recalibrated their supplyanddemand expectations for Treasuries leading to longerdated US Notes ie 10Year and 30Year selling off by nearly 20 in price in the weeks after with longdated Treasury yields increasing by more than 100 and reaching their highest levels in more than 15 years Such moves are rare let alone when inflationary pressures were reported to have moderated during the same time period as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price CPI IndexIn actuality this shift represented a reset in real rates  which is the difference between the nominal yields for US Treasuries and overall inflationary expectations It is also a development that has reverberated throughout the broader capital markets as the 10Year US Treasury is considered to be the benchmark rate for debt markets globally and the most important asset in the world according to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh As a result yields for other fixedincome securities factored in the adjustment in real rates during the quarter impacting the prices for most interestrate sensitive investments globally including listed real estateIn terms of the impact on commercial real estate markets this adjustment in real rates will undoubtedly lead to more elevated costs of capital and reduced property values in the neartermwhich will be particularly troubling for real estate enterprises with significant amounts of debt or meaningful nearterm maturities On the other hand these developments seem to offer certain silver linings for distinct pockets of the commercial real estate industry including i wellcapitalized market participants with limited debt maturities as well as excess capital to deploy as investment opportunities arise ii investors in listed real estate as the impact of higher discount rates has seemingly been factored into security prices and now offers a historically attractive basis when measured on most fundamental valuation metrics and iii owners of strategic real estate assets as more restrictive lending terms will likely lead to a lack of new construction serving to further tension the supplyanddemand picture which could result in outsized rent growth in certain instances over the mediumtermThis final point is worth expanding on as the return potential of incomeproducing real estate with pricing power is often misperceived in a higher interest rate environment in our opinion For instance if one were to hypothetically purchasea portfolio of singlefamily rental properties at a 600 nominal cap rate ie the initial yield  and the income stream were to increase by 400 per year on average over a 5year holding period then one would realize a return of approximately 1000 provided the exit cap rate ie the yield at the end of the investment period remained at the same leveleven after taking out an additional 15 expense for management fees and maintenance costs along the way In fact the portfolio would provide a return in excess of 5Year US treasuries 475 provided the exit cap rate remained below 790 in the scenario outlined above thus allowing for nearly a 200 increase in cap rates over the holding periodPut otherwise incomeproducing real estate can provide an attractive real return even in a higher interest rate environmentprovided it has pricing power and modest levels of cap ex and corporate overhead  It is for these reasons among others that the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund has concentrated its incomeproducing real estate investments into very wellcapitalized enterprises with similar characteristics and distinct supplyanddemand drivers eg emerging selfstorage platforms industrial real estate portfolios with belowmarket rents premier mixeduse destinations and niche residential rental businesses It is also the framework for the Funds additions to Sun Communities Inc and Big Yellow plc during the quarterFounded in the mid 1970s Sun Communities Inc Sun Communities or Sun  is the largest single owner of Manufactured Housing MH  and Recreational Vehicle RV  communities in North America with more than 500 properties comprised of nearly 150000 leasable sites and a particular focus on the Sunbelt and Midwest regions of the US The company is also the largest owner of marinas in the US with 135 locations and nearly 50000 slips as well as investments in the MH and RV space internationally primarily through its whollyowned subsidiary Park Holidays in the UK and 10 stake in separatelylisted Ingenia Communities in Australia also held in the FundAs outlined in greater detail within the Funds   these niche property types principally lease land sites and power access to MH and RV owners and have historically enjoyed steady demand restricted supply and limited maintenance costs As a result Sun Communities has proven capable of keeping occupancy rates above 950 over the past 10 years on average and has increased revenues on a persite basis by more than 60 per year during that same time period also on averagemost of which has dropped to the bottom line given the limited reinvestment required Consequently Sun has been amongst the leaders in the REIT industry in terms of cash flowgrowth and hardly ever gets cheap per seThat said Suns common stock has underperformed more recently In our opinion this not only stems from a more recent increase in borrowing and insurance costs but is also due to the overhang of Suns rapid acquisition activity Historically a very focused company Sun has increased its exposure to international markets as well as more volatile revenue streams relative to its traditional MH and RV businesses through a series of investments in recent years Therefore the companys shares now trade at a sizable discount to its closest peer as well as a conservative estimate of NetAsset Value NAV  in our viewIt is therefore not inconceivable that Suns aligned control group gets back to basics and refocuses the company on the core MH and RV communities in the period ahead In the meantime the Fund owns Sun common stock at prices that imply a cap rate in excess of 600nearly the highest initial yield in more than a decadedespite management indicating at an industry conference that they expect rental rate growth of 48 across the companys key segments at the same time that manufacturing wages a key factor in MH rents seem to be accelerating at an even more rapid clipFounded in 1988 Big Yellow Big Yellow  is a UKbased REIT that owns and operates a portfolio of 108 selfstorage facilities spanning 63 million square feet of total space which is primarily concentrated in London and the Southeast region of the UK The company is also very wellcapitalized with a loantovalue ratio of approximately 15 a fixedcharge coverage of nearly 60 times and modest capital commitmentsFund Management remains fond of the selfstorage business as this property type tends to provide remarkably steady cash flows once leased up while at the same time requiring minimal ongoing capital expenditures Further should a tenant not pay rent the items in storage can be sold off and the space can be subsequently released Selfstorage is also one of the few property types that have legitimate scale advantages as companies that control platforms can operate much more efficiently than independent owners due to various operating synergies and also significantly lower customer acquisition costs when viewed on a per unit basis given the transition to online procurement in recent yearsNotwithstanding the primary drawback for selfstorage facilities is that it is considered to be amongst the easiest property types to build alongside industrial However Big Yellow has a unique position as the leading owner in a region with significantly less competition than its US peers as well as more restricted building codes in its core markets ie there is estimated to be less than two square feet of selfstorage space per capita in the UK relative to more than nine square feet in the US Moreover due to the vast majority of its portfolio having been acquired or developed within the past decade its occupancy rates have yet to reach stabilization providing a unique opportunity to match the utilization of its more established US peers ie Big Yellows portfoliowide vacancy rate was reported to be more than 19 in its most recent financials relative to approximately 6 for the established US selfstorage REITsWhen considering the fundamental backdrop eg expanding awareness demand from small business population growth et al it seems as if Big Yellow has the potential to increase its portfolio occupancy rates towards 900 over timewhich would likely allow the company to match the 70 increase in revenues it has posted on average over the last 10 years Industry followers would also likely point out that such a development would also have a disproportionate impact on the underlying cash flows given the fixedcost nature of selfstorage facilities ie operating margins for its recently integrated facilities are less than 60 relative to margins for its more stabilized facilities of 74Meanwhile Big Yellow common stock trades at prices which imply an approximate 730 cap rate on the existing portfolio with only a slight uplift to the book valueof its development pipeline In Fund Managements opinion this price seems very modest relative to a reasonable estimate of NetAsset Value as well as significantly in excess of the 500 estimated cap rate that Nuveen recently agreed to acquire Self Storage Group ASA a Nordic selfstorage platform for despite that entity having substantial ground leases relative to 99 of Big Yellows locations now being controlled under feesimple arrangementsOutside of these additions the Funds other activity was modest in nature and included a slight addition to Savills plc as well as reductions to certain holdings for portfolio management purposes Lennar Corp DR Horton Prologis Segro Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier The Fund also extended out its hedge relating to its Hong Kong Dollar exposure during the periodAfter factoring in this activity the Fund had approximately 43 of its capital invested in Residential Real Estate companies with strong ties to the US and UK residential markets wherethere remain supply deficits after years of underbuilding In conjunction with near recordlow inventory levels there also remains significant demand for new product at affordable price points both forsale and forrent Therefore these Fund holdings seem positioned to benefit from a multiyear recovery in residential construction and ancillary activities particularly as mortgage rate volatility subsides At the end of the quarter these holdings included a diversified set of businesses including homebuilding Lennar Group and DR Horton timberland ownership Aand management Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier planned development Berkeley Group and Five Point Holdings niche rental platforms AMH Grainger plc Ingenia Communities and Sun Communities as well as other ancillary businesses Lowes and Trinity Place HoldingsThe Fund also had 31 of its capital invested in Commercial Real Estate enterprises that are involved with veryselect segments of the property markets At the current time these holdings are primarily focused on companies seemingly capitalizing on secular trends including structural changes driving more demand for industrial properties selfstorage facilities and lastmile fulfillment Prologis UHaul Segro plc First Industrial InvenTrust Big Yellow and National Storage as well as the further densification and improvements taking place in select urban corridors CK Asset Holdings and Wharf Holdings In Fund Managements view each of these enterprises is very wellcapitalized their securities trade at discounts to privatemarket values and they seem capable of providing compelling real returns in the face of higher interest ratesprimarily by increasing rents undertaking development activities and by making opportunistic acquisitionsAn additional 23 of the Funds capital is invested in Real Estate Services These real estaterelated businesses are generally less capitalintensive than direct property ownership and consequently have offered much higher returns on capital over the course of a cycleprovided they have favorable positioning within their respective segments At the present time these holdings include franchises involved with brokerage and property management CBRE Group Savills plc and JLL investment management Brookfield Corp and Brookfield Asset Management as well as mortgage and title insurance FNF Group and the GSEsThe remaining 3 of the Funds capital is in Cash Debt  Options These holdings include USdollar based cash and equivalents shortterm Treasuries hedges relating to certain foreign currency exposures Hong Kong Dollar and an investment in the Senior Unsecured Notes of Five Point Holdings The Funds allocations across these various business types are outlined in the chart below along with the exposure by geography North America Europe and siaPacific In addition the discount to NetAsset Value NAV  for the Funds holdings when viewed in the aggregate expanded to approximately 261 at the end of the quarter by Fund Managements estimates and the holdings remain very wellcapitalized in Fund Managements view with an average loantovalue ratio of 16 at the present timeDuring the quarter the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund celebrated its 25th year of operations As a result the strategy now has one of the most established track records in real estate securities and has remained unique relative to other Real Estate Mutual Funds during that time span in our view byAlthough these core tenets of the Real Estate Value strategy have remained unchanged since its 1998 inception the process by which it is implemented has been enhanced over the years on three key fronts One the strategy expanded its opportunity set by pursuing value investments in select international markets which have been additive to returns for nearly two decades now Two the Fund has remained concentratedbut more prudently than early on with stricter portfolio construction guidelines relating to position size geographic exposure and property type allocations And three the daytoday management of the Fund has transitioned to a teambased effort which utilizes a welldefined and repeatable process making it more durable over the longterm our primary focusThe results of this evolution have been satisfactory To wit the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund had generated an 815 annualized return at its twentyfiveyear mark exceeding its primary index as well as the SP 500 Index over that extended period of time The results also support Third Avenues longheld view that an actively managed fund with a sound strategy robust process and aligned portfolio management team has strong prospects to outperform relevant benchmarks over the longterm on average and most of the timeNotwithstanding Fund Management believes in continuous improvement  including using its experience to draw upon lessons learned with the goal of further enhancing the process and potential results in the years ahead With that being the case Fund Management recently revisited some of the largest contributors and detractors to performance over the years and found three indistinguishable themes on each side of the ledger In terms of types of investments that have detracted from performance since the Funds inception the primary allocations have includedConversely the allocations that could be characterized as the key drivers of performance over the past 25 years primarily includeWhile such investments havent represented all of the contributors or detractors one should expect the Fund to eschew those that could be characterized by the former while concentrating more capital around the latterwhen the pricetovalue proposition is appropriate Coincidentally now seems to be one of those moments and frankly very similar to when the Fund was launched in 1998 in a number of respects with i the SP Index trading at aboveaverage earnings multiples ii Real Estate securities seemingly outoffavor and iii 10Year US Treasuries yielding around 500 Similar to then it also seems to be an opportune time to own real assets at modest valuations with prudent leverage and to the extent the next few years of performance mirror those first few years of the strategy it may prove to be a rewarding time to be invested in the Fund However Fund Management would be disappointed if the results were not even better given the lessons learned along the wayWe thank you for your continued support and look forward to writing to you again at yearend In the meantime please dont hesitate to contact

312,U.S. Oil & Gas Is A Good Bet - Jennifer Warren,Listen below or on the go via  or Energy expert  on why US oil and gas looks like a safe bet 130 recent industry MA sensible consolidation and correcting false narrative 1240  Hello Michael Hopkins with Seeking Alpha with Jennifer Warren from Concept ElementalYou just had a trip up to Montana and you presented a keynote about energy and geopolitics at the University of Montana and the World Affairs Council Maybe talk a little bit about that and what were some of the takeaways Yeah so this was a conference it was hosted by the Central and Southwest Asian Studies Center And that part of the world is connected to Russia China the Middle East Europe by definition So its in the middle of so many regions that are in the news so to speak of lateAnd so it was very timely to be there And there were absolutely foremost experts on the Middle East and the region And so that was really educational And I talked about energy and geopolitics largely from the point of view of having  all the shale booms and busts and what it means in terms of geopolitics And then it was also notable that at this time whats happening theres a lot of obviously geopolitical conflict right now which is really really ramping up marketsOne takeaway from my presentation was just that US oil and gas production is kind of looking like a bit of a safe harbor in some respects its a positive and I think that message came throughAnd also just the idea that physics is also driving this energy transition a lot a lot more than people would like to think but its kind of the truth And that was sort of also my other takeaway from the conferenceAnd just that energy production globally is really of net benefit to societies Its a source of economic development and its a positive story Its a good news story at a time when theres a lot of really tough challenges and hopefully these conflicts can end cause theres going to be economies to rebuild and energy is going to be at the core of this as well Thats kind of some of my high level takeaways from the conference So before that you attended an economics conference with leaders from around the globe and the Fed any highlights to share from that Yeah sure So yeah it was a pretty intense you know 7 days This conference it was the National Association of Business Economists And it was a gathering of economists from around the world and economists from all the major universities and Bloomberg was there and top economists Actually I sat next to one of the former top Chief Economists of the EIA which is our energy watchdog And there was somebody from the Embassy of AustraliaAnd yeah it was really pretty amazing And you know a few Fed presidents as well as one fed Board of Governors presentation that I found I was really struck by his presentation The message that he delivered was just that were doing all this were trying to smooth this economy out and theyre having to do it with interest rate increases that have had to happen for all kinds of reasons that we know and we wont go intoBut the whole idea is shared prosperity Again that same message that this is the endgame of it all you know and its a really complex task to get thereAnd you know its a tough job they have and I know theyre under constant criticism and scrutiny and analysis and I get it completely You know I used to do the same and I still watch quite a bit The other thing that was oh and kind of one of the takeaways was just that you know this continued restrictive policy stance but at the same time really trying to monitor current developmentsOf course theres backwards looking data and I know that there was kind of a criticism about their approach I read today by a leading thinker you know that theyre too backward looking they need to be more forward looking and all that But honestly you know from sitting there with them and listening to what theyre looking at too theyre about as forwardlooking as anyone could be you know I mean who has the crystal ball right So I mean so that was sort of my takeawayI would say I left that feeling confident you know confident in the leadership And then the other thing as I sat in on two panels one was on this you know supply chains and all this idea of reindustrialization things that you and I have been talking about we talked about it at the end of 2022 my after the Fed workAnd then we talked about it at the beginning the first quarter in videos and articles on supply chains and chips and all this change thats happening And its also of course driving a lot in tech as we know But with the supply chains one quick takeaway is just that there are these changing trading blocks happening that were starting to seeAnd we see this with investment even like Intel  investing in Germany and what is it Taiwan Manufacturing  you know the chip maker you know here in in Arizona you know just all of it is happening and its going to take timeAnd then the other thing is this is just one of my thoughts even though there are these sort of shifts in trading blocks were still trading with China not much less Its just happening through other proxiesSo its a still very interdependent globalized context And I think thats really apparent when you see even whats happening with the conflict going on in the Middle East No matter how you skin that cat were interconnected and our markets are interconnected and everyones invested in everyone else that sort of thing And there are all these legacy relationshipsAnd yeah theres some shifts and some new relationships And some of it were seeing in energy with our energy trade even with LNG and all that and so its just ts going to be something to continue to watch This is not going to move fast no matter what we hear announcements and things like thatIts just going to take  its all going to take time to see what shakes ultimately But I can say that the North American trading block is quite robust and its positive I even heard that from some economists comments and thats all its kind of obvious If you look at it through the energy lens its absolutely obviousAnd weve been talking about that You know Ive been talking about that since the last quarter of last year just this really national treasure that we haveBut now I want to talk about so this is just looking at oil futures And I was looking at this from a one month view October 5th to 7th you see oil prices go up like 4 They stay up they come down because were not sure whats happening they go back up And now as you can see theyre ratcheted theyve come up and everythings been kind of dragged down by whats happeningOil  have come down a little bit SP as well And some of thats driven by just the idea that you know all this conflict all this volatility all this uncertainty could start dinging global demand And that remains to be seen jurys outThis is just showing whats going on with oil supply which is also a big driver of and we cant see the tightness Hang on let me just try to do this a little bit smaller maybe in a different viewTightness is a big driver And now something I would say too is just that with this tightness between supply and demand that starts changing a little bit after the first because you know it takes a while for oil production to catch up right And prices are higher so there is some incentive to produce as well But its just sort of looking a bit tight for a little bit and then well see how that all shakes outAnd also geopolitics are going to have something to do with this One thing I would say is these other countries that are kind of involved in a lot of the geopolitical conflicts at the moment are also energy producers So I think theres that to also considerThis summer we have had the hottest most summer load demand ever And it was like 80 85 megawatts And remember Id been talking about the grid and the stress of the grid But I can also say with Texas you know its a grand experiment in energy trying to become energy efficientLike I said were well diversified with our energy mix We have a lot of renewables We have the transmission problems that everybody has And Ive discussed that in that kind of Texas million dollar mile story We have the connectivity issues that everybody hasSo what it all means is in spite of the IRA legislation its all still going to move slow But there are a lot of new ideas happening I actually listened to an energy conference on Friday and theres some really innovative things happening in Texas and thats a story for another dayAnd this is just speaking to the yield issue you know with the Fed and one thing I will say too I know theres been this focus about the term premium and what thats just really about is the addition to longterm yields that is not just attributed to interest rate risesAnd sort of what they were talking about at the economist conference was that  of the longterm yield one half of it right now is comprised of this term premium And that has to do with actors and behavior expectationsAnd something that is driving that it is thought is our national debt The idea that with interest rates being higher and then the national debt going up its going to get more expensive to fund that And thats a headwind that can crowd out investment it can do all sorts of things So if anything the idea of fiscal restraint is ever more importantAnd then this is something else from the Economist Conference  has a lot of debt that is not apparent and is not you know just discussed And that by 2025 this debt this hidden debt could be 5x as large as what is recognized by officially recognized counterparts So that is something and were in the same boatTheres been this movement towards oil and gas as an investment just because everything thats going on  which started last year is kind of a recipe for these hard assets Oil prices have been up its just kind of like a safe harbor in some respectsUS oil exports reached a high in the first half of 2023 And were just going to continue to export oil And thats a positive thing that were on the global stage with our oil and gas productionIn 2023 natural gas production per well theyve just become more efficient And that is partly why we see natural gas prices on the lower side just production is up because were producing roughly 13 million barrels a day of oil And with that as weve discussed comes a lot of associated gas in the Permian And theres a lot of oil production in the Theres gas production everywhere Haynesville and Appalachia and a lot of this is also going for LNG exports So its just showing though that the producers are getting more efficient with production compared to years past In the past youve written  about Pioneer  the Permian and now theres the Exxon   The general  what color do you have about thisWhat does this mean for the market for investors when theyre looking at these deals Yes so you know we talked about this consolidation happening you know potential happening in the industry at the end of last year You know in our  after the  we had  there are slides on this  we talked about you know the cash on the balance sheets of large oil and gas firms And that deals were getting bigger going to be and by default they are bigger So we kind of nailed that back thenAnd its playing out because also I think weve had to figure out where are oil prices going to be Whats the narrative You know is it this green transition or is it oil and gas what is happening in betweenReally right now with returns and with whats happening around the world this consolidation makes even more sense And then as oil prices are up again what are you going to do with that cash Are you just going to return it all to the shareholder or are you going to invest for tomorrowWell theyve decided to invest for tomorrow And the idea that you know okay some are saying oh this just means oil and gas is around a lot longer Well thats true And that was always true You know if you just look at the numbers the demand how much primary energy demand is met by fossil fuel usageAnd the affordability and all the things we have talked about in the past And of course absolutely you know this is also a way actually to produce these resources more cleanly when you have scale when you have efficiency you know so I dont think that speaks to it being done you know with less decarbonization in mind not at all Thats a false narrativeAnd so I would just say that the idea that Exxon and Chevron  are now making these major lets just call it 60 billion acquisitions respectively because thats what they are Pioneer was 60 and Hess is just a notch under 60 billionIt just speaks to the assets that make sense for those two players you know Exxon has a certain culture certain operations the Permian is a big deal for them This completes that part of their portfolio and their intentions their goal their stated goals that theyve had for a long time anyway So this kind of just fits right into thatAnd then with  because theyre a little bit different they have a little bit different strategic outlook And one thing thats been noted is the Guyana assets were a big deal for them And thats absolutely true And also theyre going to be in you know the basins there in the Rockies a little bit more with some of the assets they boughtSo I just think it speaks to these large  working with their competencies and so I think from an investment point of view is just a positive I have Exxon Pioneer I dont have much CVX I have it represented in other ways Id always wished I had CVX Dang it I was just doing other things but I do have some Hess  so thats goodSo I just think its the ideas what weve talked about even at the beginning of the year remember I was talking about scale efficiency consolidation all these things And it makes sense in this environment where inflation is higher Youve got to get those costs down And this is one way to do it So I think it makes a lot of senseAnd the other thing Ill note is just that you know weve talked about this US majors versus European majors point of view I think investors in the market are voting with their feet and with their pocketbooks And so that is my big big takeaway And geopolitics supports it Longterm economic growth and development supports it So do we see more deals coming down the pipeline then Probably I imagine its going to be happening all in the underbrushEverything that has happened in the last year on the geopolitical front which absolutely intersects with energy I think it really speaks to the environment that were in and the outlook ahead And that just the  its a good bet rightIts a positive development And it makes sense that theres consolidation because we are going to produce more efficiently in the future hydrocarbons we are going to produce them more cleanly And in fact in these tieups I think its going to actually bode well for innovation in the future as well So I think its a positive all around Exports I mean this is becoming like an important story it sounds like or its already an important story but does this become the story then for energy markets not only through the end of the year but maybe 2024 as well Yeah I think its a part of the story right Its not the whole story Its an important part of the story in looking at specific companiesYou know what are they able to export that has a decent growth trajectory ahead And we know energy is positive right Its needed but okay well will there be more shifts to energy trade routes I mean weve already had a huge shift once what happened with Russia invading Ukraine We know that Europe stopped using has been weaning off Russian pipeline gas theres still LNG floating around you know but we have been exporting a lot moreI think the projection is and I think we talked about this a couple of videos ago just that I think we were exporting like  in the summers like 13 BCF a day and its projected in the next number of years to go up to maybe 30 So thats growth thats consistent growth Its a projection Its a scenarioSame with natural gas liquids ethane propane you know all that Crude yes But theres a lot of different players in that space right And in different assets So theres a lot of nuance to the various firms as to who can do what you know not everybody can do it So thats one thingAnd so Id say be nuanced about it It is a theme you know but you better understand your numbers and how things are moving aroundLook at the production look at who different players like  and the Permian really great Permian player you know Whos solid whos got solid production thats got room to run in the future that kind of thing as wellI mean think about AI I mean oh you know when we had the  you know right before Memorial Day everyone was like huh AI every tech company involved is going to  from AI Woo lets watch the  go way up And it did but now its coming back down to earth like okay who can really leverage enterprise AI What aspect of AIEveryones hitched their wagon to the marketing idea of AI but certain firms can pull it off better than others You know its the same thinking same in energy same  Again I appreciate the time Very insightful Im looking forward to what happens next Thanks for having me MichaelEditors Note

313,SoFi Is Digging A Wider Moat,A common refrain I still hear from people who do not think SoFi  is a good investment is that there is significant competition and that SoFi does not have a moat If a business doesnt have a moat itWith the rare exception of heavy patent protection a moat takes time to dig and fill with water Moats arent just bestowed by the investing gods they are built through exceptional execution What determines whether SoFi will be just a bank or the winner take most in the fintech space is their executionThis leads to one of the core tenants of my examination of a companys moat While the size of the moat is very important sometimes what is more important is whether the moat is expanding or contracting Is the business executing in such a way that their competitive advantages are expanding relative to their peers Are they carving out a defensible niche and creating differentiated products that lead to better outcomes Is there an inherent network effect being created or a superior brand being built Those are hard questions to answer directly but the results invariably show up in the numbersSoFi CEO Anthony Noto is fond of saying that when he joined in 2018 that everyone was talking about being an allinone financial app but that SoFi is the only company who has actually done it However up to this point SoFis moat has been mostly theoretical They say a onestop shop should allow for a better experience and cross selling They argue that it will increase user engagement and drive greater lifetime value from their members Essentially it should make SoFis results differentiated from their competitors The data are showing that to be the case The moat is expandingSoFi has a focus on getting new members to move their direct deposit to SoFi That is because the bank where you send your direct deposit is almost always your primary bank and your primary bank is where you keep most of your money Here is what was said on the earnings call about deposit growthBig deal SoFi is getting a lot of deposits because its offering a high APY on their savings account 45 at the time of writing right Ally  currently gives 425 LendingClub  clocks in at 45 Discover  is at 43 SoFi and LendingClub are equal now but LendingClub actually had higher APY than SoFi for the entirety of 2Q23 If it all came down to APY LendingClub should have been the biggest winner and all the others should have also seen significant deposit growth Credit to Vadim Kotlarov for this graphicEvery neobank has seen deposit growth over the past year as theyve been taking customers away from incumbent banks by offering higher APYs than the likes of JPMorgan  Wells Fargo  and Citigroup  However peak deposit growth for most neobanks was 4Q22 and theyve all seen a steep drop in growth thereafter There is one exception SoFis deposit growth has continued to accelerate LendingClub even saw deposits shrink in the last quarter despite offering higher rates that SoFi the entire quarterWhen I see a definitive trend reversal like that across an entire industry with one outlier who bucks that trend I take note Especially when on the face of it there is no reason for it It isnt like SoFi gave higher APY or even higher signup bonuses during these last two quarters than before They didnt increase marketing spend as well see in a second they just outperformed the competition because of something innate about the product This is a testament to the fact that their product is differentiating itself in other less obvious ways This is what a moat looks likeSoFi is paying less in customer acquisition costs CAC than they have in well over a year while simultaneously adding more members than they ever have before As CEO Anthony Notos described it in the earnings callI love that he said that this trend is continuing into Q3 as well One quarter of lower CAC and high member adds is not definitive proof that they truly have turned a corner However the increase in brand awareness they highlighted in the earnings call also provides data that supports this trend If CAC can stay low as quarterly new members climb it would be another piece of evidence that the moat is growingLast November I wrote that   the two other fintech companies who operate primarily in the fintech lending space All three of them at the moment rely on personal loans as their main source of revenue and income They all compete for borrowers and selling loans to the same debt investors Ill provide a little more nuance into the different business models below but I think the performance of these three companies since that article proves my analysis at the time was prescient The differentiation of SoFi from its competitors is only getting more obvious over timeAll three of these fintech businesses have to deal with a supply and demand issues on two fronts On one front they are offering to lend money to those who want a personal loan These potential customers may be trying to refinance high variable rate credit card debt into lower fixed rate personal loans renovating their house financing solar panels or any other reason Ill refer to this as borrower demand and it is extremely strong right now People are looking at their credit card statements feeling the pain and seeking to refinance that variable rate debt into a lower fixed rateOn the other side of the equation are debt investors These are banks and asset managers such as hedge funds sovereign wealth funds pension funds etc These are the entities that buy loans from companies like SoFi LendingClub and Upstart All three of these companies sell loans to these debt investors and depend on them for liquidity and to an extent their revenue and profits Ill refer to this as investor demand and right now it is weak As a result of the banking crisis most banks are actively looking to offload assets like personal loans to decrease their risk profiles and increase liquidity Bank demand for personal loans is very low and in fact they are selling loans This results in excess supply of assets at the moment Asset managers are happy to step in but the increase in supply means that they can be very picky about the pricing and the quality of the loans they are purchasing The result is that investor demand is very weak right nowI like to give context for my analysis so lets briefly review the similarities and differences between SoFi LendingClub and UpstartUpstarts target market is near prime and subprime candidates whom Upstart believes are higher quality borrowers than their FICO score would indicate They do not disclose the average FICO score of the loans they fund or refer to their partners Upstart for the most part tries not to hold loans on the balance sheet They use their machine learning algorithm to determine credit worthiness and approve or deny the loan at a given APR The majority of their revenue comes from fees they charge up front for finding and approving the loan They let someone else hold the loan collect interest and take the default riskUpstart has two cohorts of buyers of their loans partner banks and the asset managers mentioned above Partner banks can use Upstart as the de facto credit check service for their own customers and also can house loans that Upstart approves through its platform They grew originations like crazy during the zero interest rate policy ZIRP days However Upstart immediately ran into issues as soon as rates started to increase Origination growth was only positive 1Q22 because Upstart stepped in and used their balance sheet to fund loans While they have continued to use their balance sheet it hasnt been enough and demand to buy their loans has completely collapsed Originations plummeted for 4 straight quarters before seeing a slight uptick in 2Q23LendingClub targets nearprime prime and prime plus customers who are serial users of credit For loans they hold on their own balance sheet as of 4Q22 the average FICO score was 729 and the average income was 116000 The entire servicing portfolio which includes loans theyve sold to others had an average FICO of 717 and average income of 113000 at that same time They stopped disclosing those numbers in 2023LendingClub also has two cohorts for the loans they originate The first is themselves LendingClub is a bank and takes a portion of their loans and puts them in their Loans Held for Investment HFI portfolio These are loans that LendingClub intends to hold on their books through maturity The remaining loans are sold on what they refer to as their marketplace which is comprised of the same type of debt investors referred to above So they have a pretty steady rate at which they add loans to their own HFI portfolio as the existing loans are paid off and then a variable amount of loans they sell on top of that The amount of variable loans they sell fluctuates but right now it is limited by investor demand from their marketplaceIn their  LendingClub warned that the marketplace demand might soften as rates rise CEO Scott Sanborn explained For certain investors their funding costs will move based on the forward curve meaning where the fed is expected to go These investors are seeking more yield to cover their increased costs Investor costs move with where people  rates to go so their costs went up faster than the actual funds rates LendingClubs loan pricing by their own admission lags the Fed Funds rate hikes by at least a few months Investors were getting squeezed with higher costs now but the loans they were buying did not yet have higher interest rates to offset those costsThis is exactly what happened During 3Q22 marketplace originations dropped 15 from 282B to 239B correspondingly dropping their revenue from those loans from 2138M to 1812M This drop in marketplace originations has continued every quarter for the past year Part of the reason for the marketplace drop is because they keep the highest quality prime and prime plus loans their HFI portfolio and sell the lower quality prime and near prime loans to investorsNow lets move on to SoFi SoFi employs a slightly different model to Upstart and LendingClub Rather than have two separate cohorts for their loans SoFi holds all originated loans on their own balance sheet for a period of time before selling them on to debt investors They previously guided for 67 months holding period but right now theyve been holding them much longer because of the weakness in investor demand In this way SoFis balance sheet acts more like a shock absorber giving them liquidity and optionality SoFi can absorb or release loans as needed As CEO Anthony Noto put it previouslyRight now the opportunity lies in gobbling up market share of their core target demographic  highearning highquality customers not well served by the current banking system As Upstart and LendingClub are slowing originations SoFi has continued to increase them In 1Q22 SoFi was only originating less than 23 the volume of personal loans as LendingClub and less than half the volume of Upstart Now they are originating a little under double LendingClub and more than triple UpstartSoFis borrowers are also the most affluent and highest quality of the three companies Their personal loan borrowers have an average FICO of 745 and an average income of 164000 Furthermore SoFi has actually been frontrunning the feds interest rate hikes They raised the APR they charge their borrowers faster than the Fed hiked rates and faster than their competitors They could do this because of the the strong demand caused by their network effects Raising rates faster than competitors and simultaneously increasing originations is a differentiated result Their key underwriting variable is cash flow because they want to make sure that borrowers have excess monthly cash flow to cover their loan paymentAll three of these companies have a ton of borrower demand at the moment so that does not explain the discrepancy in originations SoFi is proving their lending moat is expanding in three ways superior availability of funding choosing resilient customers and better underwritingLC underwent origination growth in 2021 and 2022 after receiving their bank charter in December 2020 However their marketplace originations have tanked in 2022 and 2023 because of rising rates and tightening credit as described above They do not leave room on the balance sheet to absorb any fluctuations in investor demand so marketplace originations boom and bust in real time with fluctuations in investor demandUpstart has virtually no control over their funding sources so they are almost completely dependent on the whims of the economic environment LC has been able to maintain some stability in originations because they hold a portion in the bank to maturity and can replace those as they hit their term When demand from banks and asset managers for new loans dries up Upstart gets hit the hardest They have had to give preferential pricing and take on extra risk to supplement volumes in hard times It is not a durable business through a full market cycle Upstart the most cyclical of the three businessesSoFi got their bank charter in 1Q22 They have had significantly more flexibility to add loans to their balance sheet throughout 2022 and 2023 because they are the funding source Its part of the plan to be vertically integrated across the entire business and own the whole processSoFis business model to hold loans on the balance sheet for a variable amount of time and then selling them when the economics make sense appears to have given them the most flexibility to combat the economic turmoil caused by the rapidly rising rate environment It even compares favorably to LCs business model even though both have bank charters The timing of the bank charter was also fortuitous no doubt about it and has allowed them to continue scaling because they had plenty of room on the balance sheet to hold their own loans However I would argue that the business model is still superior because of the extra flexibility it gives them Business model and execution are part of SoFis expanding moatSoFis decision to only loan to affluent and high quality borrowers is a part of the business model that makes them resilient SoFi could easily have loosened credit standards in the easy money ZIRP days They did not Instead they deliberately built a robust business model that can grow through an entire cycle LC and Upstart leaned into lending to lower quality borrowers during the ZIRP days to boost growth but as investor demand pulled back they have been forced to move up the value chain to higher quality borrowersSoFi was already focused on a higher quality pool of borrowers and has not seen their potential clientele shrink in the same way In fact SoFis allinone platform has attracted record members This has allowed them to grow originations more than 6x from 614M in 4Q20 to 37B in the most recent quarter without compromising on credit qualitySoFi chose an antifragile business model and it has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth through the significant headwinds that all three businesses have faced in the last year and a half That means they are now far and away the market share leader in the fintech personal lending space and even more so in their credit box This gives them an advantage to maintain that position moving forward When the credit cycle turns and demand returns they will be in position to ramp originations to maintain their place as the leader selling loans as required at a profit to facilitate the increasing volumesSoFis credit outcomes are demonstrably better The first reason for this dovetails with their resilient clientele Higher quality borrowers hold up better in adverse economic conditions Deliberately targeting that cohort of borrowers was a choice that is now paying dividends for the businessUpstart publishes what they refer to as their Upstart Macro Index or UMI It gives a value that predicts how many of their borrowers will default on their loans relative to historical norms If default rates are normal UMI is 1 If loans are overperforming because of the macro environment eg the government gave out a bunch of stimulus checks UMI is less than 1 If loans are underperforming eg stimulus stops and inflation is at 40 year highs the UMI is above 1 UMI has literally never been higher than it is today Upstarts borrowers are defaulting 70 more often than normalSoFi outperforming Upstart is to be expected as affluent customers are more resilient That does not explain how SoFi is seeing lower defaults than before the pandemic LCs borrowers are ostensibly in the same credit box at SoFi yet LC borrowers defaults crossed over prepandemic levels in 1Q23 SoFi just reiterated again in their 2Q23 earnings call that their credit outcomes are  better than they were before the pandemic Not only that but their default rates actually  between 1Q23 and 2Q23I do not know of a single lender of any type  bank fintech or otherwise  who can make that same claim SoFis underwriting is best in class and leads to better credit outcomes This is what a moat looks like When SoFis balance sheet does eventually fill it stands to reason that their superior credit outcomes and higher rates charged on their loans should allow them to find buyers for their loans easier than competitors This is a claim that cannot yet be proven with data but we can track in the coming quarters LC did mention in their earnings call that the one bright spot for investor demand is for their seasoned prime personal loans That just so happens to be exactly the type of loans SoFi has in abundanceExceptional companies differentiate themselves in the hard times The data supports the argument that SoFi really is building a business that is better than its peers SoFi has a robust business model built on a more resilient client base They utilize superior underwriting They are continuing to accelerate deposit growth Essentially they offer an allinone platform that is taking market share for banking and lending That has led to better outcomes in hard times I think the evidence makes those statements undeniably true When the headwinds slow differentiated results will continue to separate them from competitors The moat is getting deeper and wider every quarter  The information contained in this article is for informational purposes only You should not construe

314,Okeanis Eco Tankers: Riding The Upcoming Crude Tanker Bonanza,Editors note Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome ZY Capital as a new contributor Its easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium Okeanis Eco Tankers  OSLOOET is a young crude tanker owner among more established bellwether names such as Euronav  and Frontline  It owns the most attractive fleet and is appropriately leveraged to capture the multiyear upcycle in charter rates as suggested by the almost nonexistent orderbook With consistent outperformance against benchmark rates a fantastic dividend policy and significant management ownership I believe OET is poised to outperform in the upcoming crude tanker bonanzaCrude tanker owners and this should hold true for most of shipping are atAnd this is exactly the cyclicality of shipping  owners are flush with cash at the height of the boom ordering more ships which lead to oversupply and poor rates incentivising scrapping which tightens supply and causes rates to skyrocketCrude tankers are used to carry crude oil and dirty petroleum products and are classified by their sizes VLCCs 2 million barrels are the largest of them all followed by Suezmaxes 1 million barrels and Aframaxes 600000 barrels Larger vessels usually have better unit economics while smaller vessels have the flexibility to enter any port canal due to the small draftTankers are usually chartered out for some form of day rate of which there are two A simple analogy would be that a time charter is like renting a car whereas a spot charter is like taking a cab As you can probably guess time charters are more stable and more accurately reflect longterm outlook rather than shortterm sentimentIt is also important to note that different owners have different percentage of their fleet on time versus spot charters which can skew accounting revenue comparisons as spot charter rates include voyagerelated expenses Therefore it is common to see these companies publish their time charter equivalent TCE earnings which is essentially gross charter revenues net of any voyagerelated expenses incurredThe  governs the major routes and publishes the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index which can be used to gauge how average rates have moved daily Some major routes are also scrutinized traders such as the TD3C which is a VLCC route between the Middle East and China but that is a topic mostly for traders and charterersOkeanis Eco Tankers was listed back in 2018 with some vessels under construction that have all been delivered sinceToday the company owns 6 Suezmaxes and 8 VLCCs all of which are ecodesigned and scrubberequipped It has a market capitalization of about US750 million with an equivalent amount of longterm debtIn  the company reported 708k fleetwide TCE and 744 million in EBITDA EPS was 160 and the company announced its decision to pay out the 160 in its entirety as a dividend equivalent to an annualized yield of 28Ask anyone and they will probably tell you about the extreme cyclicality in shipping like Ive mentioned in the industry overview section above The shipping industry collectively is not known for making the best capital allocation decisions often overordering and directly contributing to the next crash in rates See the  immediately after the exceptional year they had in 2021 for a recent exampleTherefore the supply of vessels is something shipping investors scrutinize to identify any longterm opportunities in the industry One very important indicator is the orderbook as a  of the existing fleet which is the new supply entering the market As it stands the  a level we have not seen for decades and it is getting everyone riled upOf course owners with excess cash can still place orders for new ships  these are necessary capital expenditures to maintain and grow their fleets However ordering has slowed down significantly for the following reasons due to the sharp increase in raw material and labour costs A VLCC that cost 90 million in just 2018 now costs over 130 million in todays market for a 50 increase Even the most irresponsible owners would run the numbers and find that the assumptions required to justify such a purchase to be challengingShipping is usually a leveraged business to the tune of 6070 LTVs and the interest rate environment has made ordering unsavoury Financing costs comprise a significant cost of operating a ship  higher interest rates would further jack up the breakeven costs when combined with the high purchase price with some 23s of shipyards shuttered in the aftermath of the poor market in the early 2010s Whatever capacity is left has been taken up by the orders of large and complex ships like LNGLPG carriers as well as containerships There are  through to 2026 hence owners are less willing to build new ships but rather purchase existing ones to bolster fleet capacityEnvironmental regulations pose great uncertainty in shipping With talks of getting to  the shipping industry has been experimenting with alternative fuels like ammonia and LNG but  Ships are multidecade investments and owners are hesitant to place orders for newbuilds that become uncompetitive before their lifetimeAll these external conditions pose headwinds for new ordering and it is reflected in the orderbook I am personally more inclined to trust these reasons over selfimposed restrictions by shipowners who are a fickle bunchScrapping refers to the retirement of vessels for their steel value at scrapyards This is typically done when the vessel approaches the end of their useful life or when prevailing rates make it uneconomic to continue operating such vessels This is the other side of the tanker supply pictureVessels lose value rapidly as they age a function of the competitive market as well as regulations requiring expensive special surveys to verify their seaworthiness every few yearsIn a regular market scrapping occurs happens at the 20year mark Steel prices have also risen in recent years with  if they head to the breakers todayHowever scrapping activity has been muted recently due to the strong rate environment Older vessels have the unsavoury but profitable option of carrying sanctioned oil from countries like Iran and Russia also known as the  giving owners an alternative to continue operating their vesselsThis market has reduced scrapping and 32 of the current tanker fleet is aged 16 years or more With such an old fleet in operation it just takes a small nudge for owners to start selling their tankers for scrap should the shadow trade demand fadeWhile supply is the dominant force in the tanker trade I think that demand for oil transportation should also hold up in the nearterm This comes in the form of tonmiles which means that both volumes and distances can drive up demand for tankersThe concept of peak oil is unavoidable when deciding to invest in owners of tankers I do not profess to be a specialist in this area and choose to defer to official forecasts of oil demand The IEA has  by another 2 to 102mmbd and we are on track to reach those forecasts That said I dont believe the tanker market is reliant on any significant demand side tailwinds for us to enter another boomThis year OPEC has  which puts pressure on volumes transported With Brent oil trading safely in excess of 80bbl I think that this should push OPEC towards restoring production  otherwise theyd have sacrificed their oil revenues to the benefit of other producersAnother reason to be optimistic is the overall realization that exploration  production activity has to continue Shell BP and other oil majors have reversed their stances on fossil fuels and have allocated significant capex in this area Offshore exploration is making a comeback especially around the Atlantic where most incremental supply is expected to come from This is overall bullish for crude tankers because Atlantic barrels have to travel further to additional refinery capacity in the Far East So why OET compared to the other tanker owners I have repeated the fact that  are young ecodesigned and scrubberfitted ie the most environmentally friendly I dislike it when product attributes are rattled off without further explanation so let me show you why this fleet is desirableYoung vessels have an edge as they are typically more seaworthy and hence cost less to insure The benchmark age is around 15 years old after which it becomes significantly less competitive when competing for charters Every charter is a miniature market where charterers get to select the most appropriate vessel to carry their cargo and age is often an important criterion to minimize the risk of loss of cargo at seaOETs fleet profile is shown in the chart above Any vessels that fall on the right of the red line are less competitive and positioned for scrapping while vessels between the yellow and red lines will reach the 15 year old mark in the next 3 years As you can see OETs vessels are very young and should remain very attractive to charterers in the near to medium termEcodesigned refers to vessels that are built around the early 2010s specifically designed to be hydrodynamic Design variations can range from bow shape to the type of engine and can result in 10 tons of fuel savings daily This means thousands in fuel savings everyday  nothing to scoff at when we consider entire fleets operating all year round allow owners to burn cheaper  HSFO compared to the more expensive  VLSFO as mandated by IMO Owners had to make the decision to retrofit their vessels for 23 million with scrubbers to benefit from fuel cost savings While the VLSFOHSFO spread has come down to 100ton this was historically a very profitable decision with spreads exceeding 200ton OET opted to retrofit its whole fleet with scrubbers a few years ago and that has more than paid off the investment Therefore this acts as an additional layer of optionality for OET to capture the spread going forwardAs you can see having a young and decked out fleet like OET gives it an edge when competing for charters Fuel savings in both cost and volume should also translate to premiums above the benchmark ratesBesides OETs management has proven to be shrewd owners capable of repositioning their vessels opportunistically to capture better spot rates for their vessels Each route is a minimarket which can see overunderperformance versus the benchmark BDTI and you want owners who have the foresight to capture this premium OET has consistently reported TCEs higher than its peers in the crude tanker segmentOETs management is aligned with investors as the  in the company It has also stated that with minimal capex requirements unattractive newbuild economics its goal is to return as much cash to investors in the form of dividends I believe this as they recently paid out 100 EPS in Q1 2023 for an annualized yield of almost 28 This is actual cash returned to you as a shareholder rather than questionable choices like investing in new ships at cyclehigh pricesAs OET has positioned its fleet to be 100 on spot the biggest risk is a catastrophic event that reduces crude oil transportation demand which would see spot rates crater While the global economy continues to flirt with recessionary indicators I believe that short of another pandemic knock on wood risks are skewed to the upside The biggest recessions have seen just minor dips in oil demand while vessel supply is set to tighten even moreWhile the OPEC cuts act as a nearterm headwind I do not see this having an outsized impact Oil prices have been trending higher and they will soon have to turn on the taps again otherwise what was the point of all those cuts There is also the mediumterm view that incremental supply in the Atlantic will replace OPEC barrels and further drive tonmile demand for tankersAnother concern is the potential easing of Russian sanctions which was a major driver of 2022s outstanding charter rates I believe that OET is not fundamentally reliant on Russian sanctions because Russian ports cannot accommodate the larger vessel classes in OETs fleet Sanctions have lifted Aframax charter rates to near alltime highs and I would also steer clear of owners reliant on the sanction situationI value each of OETs tankers using a DCF of their earnings and add net interestbearing debt to find its valuation on a PNAV basis Key assumptions in my DCF valuation are in the table belowI arrived at a NAVshare of NOK 285 which means that OET is trading at roughly 085x NAV at todays share price of NOK 2535 I believe this is a good entry point for investors who want exposure to the upcoming crude tanker market with an attractive fleet as well as sensible management that is creating shareholder valueI have also estimated PNAVs for OETs peers in the crude tanker space  as you can see the stock trades in line with the industry average and below the more prominent names like Frontline Euronav and DHT Holdings  This valuation gap does not reflect the true quality of OETs business Management is arguably comparable to the bigger names while its fleet is unrivalled on any metric and this translates to outperformance in the charter rates it can commandI fully expect PNAVs to rise across the board and for the valuation gap between OET and the USlisted names to close as more investors pay attention to the crude tanker segment Therefore I think that OET deserves to trade at 10x PNAV or about NOK 285 per shareI believe that the supply and demand setup in the crude tanker space is the best weve seen in decades and we are at the cusp of another great cycle OET hands down owns the most attractive fleet for exposure to the crude tanker market With young vessels trading on spot minimal capital requirements and a friendly shareholder policy this means that you can count on significant dividends and capital appreciation in the next 23 yearsEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks

and Qatar the return of exploration and appraisal across Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transitionFor example Le Peuch also outlined expectations that between 2023 and 2025 Saudi Arabia would allocate nearly 100 billion to upstream oil and gas capital expenditure a 60 increase from the previous three

317,U.S. Real Estate Sector Fall 2023 Report: Four Quadrant Perspectives,The apartment sector is starting to feel the effects of both capital market and economic headwinds Demand has wavered but remains largely positive However it has not been strong enough to offset record levels of new apartment deliveries Capital and liquidity constraints are also negatively affecting both pricing and transaction activity within the sectorAlthough the apartment sector remains among the favored asset classes for commercial real estate investors it has not been immune to capital market disruptions and a deceleration in space market fundamentals Yearoveryear sales volumes have declined by 67 through August Although the sector continues to benefit from liquidity through government sponsored enterprises GSEs potential apartment buyers are still deterred by the rising cost of leverage particularly at a time when private valuations are challengedElevated levels of supply brought to the market over the past two years are beginning to put pressure on rent growth as demand struggles to keep up with the wave of construction deliveries Traditionally highgrowth markets that have seen oversupply most notably in the Sunbelt have seen a significant slowdown in rental rate growth with some markets turning negative yearoveryear More mature markets in the Midwest and Northeast are leading the country with growth down only slightly over 2022Upward pressure in cap rates IRRs and exit caps has continued to filter through apartment valuations in the back half of 2023 Data through the middle of 2023 shows that the sector has seen values written down by 89 relative to their peak in Q2 of 2022 according to the NCREIF National Property Index NPI Slower economic growth projections through the end of 2023 and into 2024 could challenge valuation further particularly in a higher interest rate environmentThe positive news for the sector is that higher required yields higher cost of debt capital and reduced availability of construction debt have begun to put downward pressure on supply pipelines Permits for multifamily unitsa good indicator of future supply have declined by 18 through August on a yearoveryear basis Once the current supply is absorbed over the coming years landlords should have a period with significantly reduced deliveries and increased pricing powerApartment loans remain mostly attractive to lenders today given overall still healthy property market fundamentals but pressure from increasing interest rates has strained valuations debt service coverage ratios and other underwriting metrics in recent months Reduced investment sales activity resulting from capital markets challenges a reduction in refinancing requests and tighter underwriting jointly led to a 51 reduction in multifamily lending volume during the first two quarters of 2023 compared to the prior year according to data from the Mortgage Bankers AssociationNonetheless broadbased lender interest in apartments paired with competitive pricing and enhanced liquidity GSEs continue to make multifamily lending rates the lowest of all property sectors Insurance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are routinely offering rates near 6 for 55 to 65 loantovalue LTV senior apartment loans secured by average to aboveaverage quality apartmentsApartment REITs have slightly outperformed the REIT index yeartodate in 2023 with coastal focused REITs leading the way Increasing numbers of new deliveries and slowing crossstate migration have pressured Sunbeltfocused companies with negative market rent growth reported in some recent updatesOn the other hand limited new supply continued return to office recovery and the lack of recession impacts following higher profile layoffs in the technology sector have supported the positive albeit decelerated fundamentals reported by the coastal REITs These trends are expected to continue into 2024 and potentially beyond until elevated supply in the Sunbelt is better absorbed Following modest yeartodate returns apartment REITs continue to trade near a 15 discount to NAV which is slightly larger than the average for other sectorsThe GSEs continue to be a dominant lender in the multifamily space with 150 billion of approved lending capacity Combined agency issuance has been constrained by low transaction volumes While much smaller in scale multifamily exposure in conduit and singleasset singleborrower SASB CMBS is significant at roughly 55 billion outstanding Loan performance has remained very strong in fixed rate as the conduit multifamily delinquency rate is at 10 its lowest level in 15 years Similarly the agency delinquency rate is only 02Some weakness is emerging in floating rate SASB loans underwritten at tight debt yields when interest rates were extremely low Rising rates have resulted in large increases in debt service burdens cooling prospects for net operating income NOI growth and valuation challenges that have resulted in the SASB multifamily delinquency rate rising to 30 Overall multifamily remains an infavor sector within CMBS given historical NOI growth slowing construction starts poor singlefamily affordability and consumeroriented credit exposureThe hotel sector remains in good shape following its recovery from the pandemic Occupancy rates are within equilibrium ranges and RevPAR growth on a 12month trailing basis has continued to show solid improvement There are emerging signs however that the sector is beginning to show signs of slowing The pace of demand and RevPAR improvements on a 3month trailing basis have both begun to slow Declines in both business travel and consumer sentiment will likely dim the outlook for income growth as economic uncertainty and a slowerthananticipated return to office will continue to provide headwinds for the sectorOn a positive note supplyside pressure remains in check and is expected to remain muted High borrowing costs and a lack of ample funding will conspire to keep development pipelines in check This should help the sector remain on an even keel despite the growing concern of a recession in the next 12monthsAlthough RevPAR has grown in 2023 its rate of growth has decelerated while hotels face increasing prices for labor insurance and other expenses Consequently lender appetite for hotel loans has also waned in 2023 with the volume of hotel loans originating during the first half of 2023 down by 20 compared to the first half of 2022 based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association Debt funds remain a primary source of capital for hotel financingsLodging REITs underperformed other property sectors yeartodate due to weaker demand from leisure travelers partially offset by an acceleration in business and urban hotel demand Throughout the summer luxury resorts and leisure destinations saw weaker demand as many travelers chose to vacation abroad particularly in Europe This led to lower nightly rates in markets that previously benefited from pentup demand throughout the pandemic The recovery in corporate travel accelerated with urban hotels narrowing their underperformance relative to leisure properties driven by increases in group demand Corporate transient travel remains weaker than expected at this time due to still sluggish returntooffice trendsThroughout earnings season lodging REITs delivered underwhelming results as revenue per available room RevPAR was negatively impacted by decelerating leisure demand while higher operating expenses particularly wagesresulted in weakerthanexpected profitability RevPAR in recent months has grown in the 1 to 3 range compared with 2022 which is a meaningful slowdown in growth since the start of the year reflecting tougher RevPAR comparisons Lodging REITs are trading at 15 to 20 discounts to NAV estimates a larger magnitude than what is seen across most other REIT sectors reflecting the uncertainty that a potential recession may have on both consumer and business travel demandDespite a slowdown in demand from postCOVID highs hotel operations have continued to show solid performance with loan performance following suit The conduit hotel delinquency rate peaked near 20 in July of 2020 and now stands at 48 just 1 higher than the overall conduit delinquency rate Leisure travel initially spurred a strong recovery in vacation destination markets with business travel recovering in turn Smith Travel Research reports that RevPAR for the 28 days ending September 15 2023 is up 10 relative to the same preCOVID period in 2019 Hotel operators have grown RevPAR by raising average daily rates while occupancies are lower than four years ago which is especially prevalent in higherend categories RevPAR growth appears to be leveling out yearoveryear as consumers have mostly burned through excess savingsCMBS issuances in 20202021 included very little hotel exposure due to underwriting challenges and investor skepticism As fundamentals have improved hotel loan contributions have grown and now stand at 10 of total conduit and over 26 of SASB collateral issued yeartodate showing that capital is available for betterpositioned properties While the recent macro trends have been supportive hotel performance is highly correlated to economic growth and would be negatively impacted by recession warranting a conservative approach to underwriting and a forwardlooking credit assessmentThe industrial sector remains in good condition but headwinds to both market fundamentals and investment performance continue to mount Demand has slowed in 2023 reverting to its prepandemic norms while high levels of new supply have already begun to push vacancy rates upward Longer term higher interest rates and more restrictive debt capital will slow the pace of new supply helping steady thesectorIndustrial market fundamentals are beginning to moderate with positive but slowing net absorption which is more in line with prepandemic norms Yearoveryear rent growth is still healthy at 77 as of midyear 2023 but has normalized from a peak of 115 a year ago The national vacancy rate has risen for the fourth consecutive quarter which will cause rent growth to moderate further into 2024Industrial occupiers are exercising caution as fears that the current highinterest rate environment will trigger a recession Weaker retail sales figures and reports of consumers trading down have also forced thirdparty logistics as well as ecommerce and brick and mortar retailers to rethink their nearterm strategies Consequently they have pulled back on growing inventories that they had accumulated during 2021 and into 2022Despite solid fundamentals and income growth the industrial sector has not been immune to capital market headwinds High interest rates and restrictive debt capital are putting further downward pressure on valuations largely due to the still low nominal cap rates discount rates and exit cap rates prevalent within the sector As a result transaction volume has continued to decline posting a total of 469 billion through the first eight months of 2023 down 53 from last years paceLenders continue to view industrialalong with multifamilyas a preferred property sector although the volume of available industrial loans has also suffered because of changing capital market conditions and lower investment sales activity The volume of industrial loans made during the first half of 2023 declined by 65 versus the same period in 2022 according to data from the Mortgage Bankers AssociationMany lenders relative underexposure to the property sector concerns regarding some other property types particularly office and reasonably robust industrial demand forecasts have fueled lender appetite for debt secured by core industrial properties Lenders today frequently offer industrial loan interest rates very near the levels offered for prime multifamily properties with LTVs commonly up to 60 Lenders also require less structure eg escrows and letters of credit for potential future retenanting costs at industrial properties than for loans secured by most other property typesIndustrial REITs have outperformed the broader REIT index yeartodate Fundamentals for the sector remain generally healthy but conditions have normalized relative to recent years Rent growth has moderated with REITs generally expecting 5 to 10 growth for the year in most markets Southern California has been the most topical market in recent months as conditions are decelerating faster than elsewhere causing several REITs to slightly dial back overall rent growth expectations for the year Key drivers include West Coast port issues and rent fatigue which have dampened demand especially for larger formatwarehousesDespite modestly lower rent growth REITs have beaten earnings expectations and raised guidance for the full year driven by stronger leasing spreads lower credit loss and acquisitions The outlook for next year is also positive as the supply and demand picture improves thanks to the sharp dropoff in development starts since late 2022 Supported by sizeable embedded marktomarket opportunities the industrial sector is wellpositioned to deliver aboveaverage earnings growth in the intermediate term The industrial sector is trading at a midtohigh singledigit discount to consensus NAV which is in line with other REITsIndustrial loans currently carry the lowest delinquency rate within the CMBS universe and continue to be viewed positively especially relative to office retail and hotel exposures This view is supported by the current economic outlook space market fundamentals and availability of capital The CMBS SASB market provided over 35 billion of floating rate debt to industrial owners from 20202022 offering an efficient source of financing for very large portfoliodealsMore recently the significant increase in floating rates has made these financings relatively unattractive to borrowers and the pace of SASB industrial issuance has fallen dramatically One dynamic to watch is the potential for borrowers to refinance existing floating rate loans into new fixed rate loans given the inverted yield curve and recent tightening in SASB creditspreadsIn the conduit space yeartodate industrial allocations within issuances have grown to three times the historical average a positive for diversification Conduit CMBS industrial loans are generally smaller than the large SASB deals and in some instances exhibit exposure to tertiary locations less functional layouts and noninvestment grade tenancy often via sale and lease backs Because of this underwriting metrics for conduit industrial loans have typically been more conservative than SASB industrial loans Overall historically strong NOI growth relatively durable cash flows and positive investor sentiment should benefit the spaceThe office sector remains vexed by subpar workplace attendance and still weakening market fundamentals Net absorption continues to decline and the national vacancy rate is as high as it has been since the early 1990s when the sector faced a supply overhang due to excess new development Capital markets have ground to a halt and lending is scant due to uncertainty in the sector and exposure risk on the part of banks and life companiesOffice remains the most challenged property sector today Headwinds are stemming from both capital and space markets Fundamentals have eroded further throughout 2023 with nearly every market across the country experiencing negative net absorption and rising vacancy rates The sector could face additional challenges from slower economic growth that would undermine officeusing job growth which up to this point has been unflaggingDespite stricter return to work policies office attendance has been stubbornly flat Physical office occupancy across the top 10 US cities remains well below preCOVID levels and has not increased materially since reaching a postpandemic peak in January of approximately 50 where it still stands as of midSeptember Inoffice attendance remains highest in sunbelt metros such as Austin and Houston which are seeing attendance in the 60 range while San Jose and San Francisco are in the low 40 rangeProgress within capital markets remains negligible Investors are continuing to require higher yields while debt capital remains difficult to find in the best of situations In many cases traditional bank and life company lenders are focused on addressing upcoming maturities within their current portfolios severely limiting the availability of new office financing and forcing some sellers to provide financing to clear office trades Consequently transaction volume is down 68 in 2023 on a yeartodate basis through AugustFew lenders are willing to finance office properties today even on the most conservative basis due to weak property market fundamentals and existing portfolio exposures Some CMBS conduits will finance office properties that feature a combination of favorable tenancy longer remaining weighted average lease terms strong physical utilization of space healthy rent collection experience and conformance with emerging design preferences However even then capital is quite limited Certain debt funds have expressed a willingness to provide loans for office properties although their required yields are typically greater than the properties existing economics willsupportMost office financing today involves existing lenders refinancing their own debt or sellers sometimes banks providing seller financing in connection with a disposition The volume of office loans made during the first half of 2023 was down 69 compared with the same period in the prior year based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association with very few truly new office loans madeOffice REITs have had a rollercoaster year but continue to underperform other REIT sectors The group started the year strong on hopes of peaking interest rates sold off sharply after the banking turmoil in March and then rallied following a highprofile office sale in New York City that featured attractive assumable financing combined with growing market optimism for a soft landing Stock market gyrations have been largely detached from fundamentals which have remained weak throughout the yearLeasing continues to be well below historical levels and REITs have seen occupancy deteriorate steadily While tenant demand remains muted the biggest issue for the sector continues to be the availability and cost of debt funding REITs have been able to refinance maturing debt but rates are materially higher which has put significant pressure on earnings and has resulted in several dividend cuts Office REITs trade at a 20 to 30 discount to consensus NAV reflecting the challenging outlookOffice exposure is facing intense scrutiny as the sector continues to face secular headwinds Conduit CMBS has historically averaged approximately 30 office exposure however issuers have responded by limiting office exposure to approximately 20 in recently issued securitizations Delinquency rates remained remarkably stable throughout the pandemic but have trended up this year from 19 to 34 for fixed rate conduit transactions Long term leases diversified rent rolls and high underwritten debt service coverage ratios DSCRs help to significantly mitigate term default risk However refinance risk is elevated given NOI pressure constrained capital markets and higher interest ratesFloating rate SASB loans are much more exposed to nearterm default risk given the significant increase in short rates and corresponding drop in DSCRs which has led to several highprofile defaults and pushed the SASB office delinquency rate to 58 Given the difficult refinance environment CMBS servicers are working with borrowers by providing loan extensions in exchange for fresh equity contributions cash flow sweeps and other lender friendly requirements This approach seeks to improve bondholder outcomes although it does create timing uncertainty which is adding to pricing concessions Recently constructed class A office is performing quite well exhibiting positive net absorption and significantly higher market rents Importantly nearly 50 of conduit CMBS office exposure is considered class A a fact that is not reflected in highly elevated market risk premiums Investors that can approach office exposure with a more discerning viewpoint are positioned to benefit from current pricing levels over the longer termThe retail sector by most accounts continues to outperform Consumers have been resolute and market fundamentals are improving unlike most other sectors at this stage in the real estate cycle A strong job market and continued income growth have provided momentum but there are signs that consumers may be starting to waver which is a concern for larger shopping centers Grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers will continue to outperform in the current environment but may come under some pressure with the specter of recession in the next 12 monthsRetail market fundamentals have remained resilient thus far in 2023 with steady demand limited store closures and minimal new supply The national vacancy rate has fallen to 42 and rent growth on a trailing 12month basis is 32 yeartodate according to CoStar Fundamentals to date have been supported by strong hiring and wage growth and a concomitant drawdown in pandemic stimulusfueledspendingWhile retail has not been immune to capital market headwinds over the past 12 months it has outperformed other property sectors on a relative basis according to the NFIODCE index The strong relative outperformance reflects not only solid fundamentals but also the higher nominal valuation metrics coming into this period of repricing Retail sales volume through August declined by 53 relative to the same period last year which reflects decreased investor appetite for commercial real estate driven by higher interest rates as well as a potential slowdown in consumer spendingInvestor demand continues to favor welllocated grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers reflecting strength of the operating fundamentals for that retail format and the perceived resilience of nondiscretionary consumer spending in a weakening macroeconomic environmentThe outlook for private equity retail remains murky Despite strong operating fundamentals today consumer resolve appears to be weakening High inflation and retailer reports of consumers trading down suggest that spending trends are starting to moderate This is a key area of concern particularly across discretionary retail formats such as malls power centers and high street propertiesSome traditional lenders have shown growing interest in neighborhood and community shopping centers with strong tenancy Major grocers creditworthy discounters and creditworthy home improvement stores with significant remaining lease terms may find receptive lenders although interest rates for even the highest quality retail properties remain perhaps 10 basis points greater than debt for similarly leveraged multifamily and industrial propertiesDebt for high street properties power centers and lifestyle centers remains difficult to procure even at more modest leverage levels and significant loan structure eg escrows and amortization is often required Debt for regional malls remains unavailable for all but the very best assets with top operators Lenders continue to focus heavily on tenant creditworthiness tenant sales history remaining weightedaverage lease terms and sponsor quality with widely disparate loan terms offeredShopping center REITs have underperformed the broader REIT sector yeartodate while the performance of mall REITs has been roughly in line Fundamentals for the retail sector remain healthy with openair shopping center REIT portfolios at record occupancy rates and improved pricing power A modest pickup in bankruptcy activity particularly in the shopping center sector has been worked through successfully REITs have already made good progress backfilling vacancies often at 10 to 30 higher rents which compensates for the downtime and capex associated with releasingThe nearterm outlook for the sector remains positive as retailer demand for space continues to be strong while there is limited supply on the horizon However the impact of a potential deterioration of retail sales due to a weaker economy softer job market depleted excess savings and the resumption of student loan payments remains to be seen This uncertainty is reflected in valuations with retail REITs trading at discounts of roughly 15 compared with consensus NAVs a modestly wider discount than is available in other property typesRetails image has recovered significantly from the pandemic era fueled by a resilient consumer base the spending drawdown in excess savings and a robust jobs market Store closures have slowed dramatically over the past two years and the entertainmentoriented transformation of malls has gotten back on track postCOVID In conjunction with conduit transaction office exposures falling in 2023 retail exposure has increased back towards historical averages at approximately 27 Interestingly once outoffavor malls have grown to 13 of conduit issuance yeartodate relative to 3 in 2022 supported by generally positive sales trends along with conservative underwriting metrics of 20x DSCR and sub50 LTV on averageMaturity stress from loans originated in 2012 and 2013 is still weighing on the conduit retail delinquency rate which stands at 66 CMBS servicers continue working with retail operators as loans approach maturity by providing loan extensions on performing properties typically in exchange for fresh equity contributions This approach seeks to maximize bondholder outcomes by keeping strong operators in place while avoiding nearterm foreclosure at a time when valuations are depressed That said note sales have recently been utilized by servicers as a more expeditious resolution strategy Similar to the hotel sector retail has benefited from the recent upside in economic activity However the health of the consumer and a potential pullback in spending need to be closely monitored for turning pointsHomeownership is out of reach for an increasing number of Americans as mortgage rates reached 23year highs in September and a lack of forsale inventory persists The combination of a strong labor market and tight forsale inventories have bolstered home prices and will likely continue to do so in the coming quarters Without significant relief in mortgage interest rates the forsale inventory is likely to stay low as lockedin owners are discouraged from listing These factors should support future rent growth for

though upward pressure on cap rates remains evident in the singlefamily rental sector aswellThe decline in bank lending activity has had a large impact on the singlefamily rental debt market Developers and institutional investors who own nonstabilized properties now often must seek debt fund capital for their financing needs which greatly increases their cost of funds For stabilized

continue to cloud the outlook The vacancy rate is now 334 and much of that space continues to be in small blocks under 5 MW leaving little space for larger deployments which tenants are looking for in the market today Pricing and rental growth continue to remain strong driven by the supply and demand fundamentals Capital markets continue to be challenged by interest rate volatilityPrivate debt

318,EOG Resources: One Of The Best Oil Stocks To Outperform The Market,This morning I was just working my way through some articles and charts I had savedOne of them is last weeks Wall Street Journal update with the title This article featured a chart that perfectly confirms what Ive communicated for roughly three years energy shareholders are in an increasingly good spotBelow were looking at the effect of oil companies deciding to focus on shareholder distributions instead of accelerating production growthRelated to this another  mentioned that the oil sectors decisions on cash utilization in the coming years have farreaching implications for US drivers and energy investorsAs the chart above shows in the past year oil executives prioritized boosting stock prices through shareholder rewards rather than investing in new drillingHowever as rising fuel costs contribute to significant inflation President Biden has called on oil companies to increase capacity leading some to redirect investments toward expansionWhile oil production is rising production is still below prepandemic levelsOn top of that US shale is losing momentum So far the Permian is the only basin expected to boost production until it might see peak production in 4Q24  as I discussed in this  among many othersAccording to  on August 14 emphasis addedThis brings me to  a stock Ive been bullish on for a while Almost three months ago I wrote an  titled  Since then EOG shares have increased 144 beating the market by roughly 13 pointsI believe that EOG is poised to reach new alltime highs soon boosted by the oil bull case The company also continues to confirm the bull case as it has deep reserves efficient production a healthy balance sheet and dedication to letting shareholders benefit from this through consistent dividend growth and special dividendsIn this article well discuss all of this and moreSo lets get to itIn light of oil price developments I believe in buying highquality oil companies with deep reserves and efficient operationsWhile buying distressed players is certainly an option I am looking for wellestablished companies that do not have major MA risks in an environment of high Tier 1 depletion risks Its why I own Canadian Natural Resources  which has more than 30 years worth of inventoryIts also why I like EOGEOG has more than 42 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves This year the company is expected to produce 986 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day Roughly half of this consists of oil This gives the company roughly 11 years of highquality reserves without any new discoveries Thats a solid number setting it apart from a lot of peersI also want companies with efficient operations not companies that will become efficient eventually Companies with efficient operations tend to be able to generate positive free cash flow even at subdued oil pricesAt elevated prices these companies turn into cash cowsCompanies that have healthy balance sheets on top of everything else tend to let shareholders benefit by distributing almost all of their free cash flow which is great for shareholdersWhile opinions differ I prefer companies that use special dividends to get rid of cash Special dividends keep companies flexible and allow investors to benefit from direct cash flows instead of indirect distributions through buybacksHeadquartered in Houston Texas EOG has major operations in the United States and Trinidad and TobagoIn the US EOG is actively investing in five premium basins a record number for the company The investments are focused on highreturn projects that contribute to lower breakeven costs and higher marginsIn the second quarter earnings call EOG explained that its assets in the Delaware Basin Eagle Ford Southern Powder River Basin Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado plays are all delivering positive resultsWell productivity and cost performance across the portfolio are meeting or exceeding expectationsFurthermore continuous investment development and innovation are driving consistent execution Technology and innovation efforts are also lowering well costs and exploration and development costs contributing to overall cost reduction and emissions reduction goalsFor example oil production saw a 3 yearonyear increase and total production grew by 5 Notably despite the industrys inflation per unit cash operating costs remained stable compared to the prioryear quarterOver the past 12 months the Return on Capital Employed was at an impressive 29 considering an average WTI oil price of 81 and a Henry Hub natural gas price of approximately 5Also using the data below we see that the companys ROCE is twice as high as it was back in 2014 using the same oil price slightly higher natural gas prices This shows that advanced operations have resulted in significant benefitsWith regard to my oil comments in the introduction EOG is as upbeat as I amDuring its earnings call the company made clear that it anticipates continued performance gains supported by strong market fundamentalsFor North American natural gas recent price increases are attributed to reduced drilling and increased demand from power generation and LNG exportsThis trend is expected to lead to a balanced supply and demand environment toward the end of the year and into 2024Hence the company maintains a positive outlook on the longterm natural gas story driven by LNG project approvals and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf CoastThe company used the 2Q23 earnings call to announce its intention to return 31 billion 4 of its market cap to shareholders in 2023 representing about 67 of the estimated 2023 cash flow based on a 75 oil priceThis commitment exceeded the target minimum return of 60EOGs regular dividend the cornerstone of its value proposition currently accounts for the majority of the 31 billion cash return to shareholders for the yearThe company emphasized its sustainable and growing regular dividend which has never been cut or suspended as its first priority for returning cash The current regular dividend yield is 25EOG also employed special dividends and share buybacks to provide additional returns to shareholders based on market conditions These special dividends are visible in the chart belowIn the first half of 2023 the company had already deployed over 600 million for opportunistic share repurchases during periods of increased market volatilityBear in mind that repurchases are opportunistic In other words if EOGs shares were to reach highly unfavorable levels management would likely use special dividends to distribute cashThe company has an A credit rating which is one of the best ratings in the industryIf oil prices remain elevated I do not rule out high singledigit percentage dividend paymentsFurthermore thanks to its efficient operations deep reserves healthy balance sheet and commitment to distributing more than 60 of its free cash flow EOG shares are doing very wellOver the past three years EOG shares have returned 251 outperforming their exploration  production peers the energy ETF  and the SP 500Given my view on oil and gas I expect EOG to keep outperforming its peers and the marketThe only reason why I do not own EOG is that I already own multiple oil stocks that account for roughly 20 of my portfolio If I were to diversify further EOG would make the cutIn this article I delved into the dynamic landscape of the energy sector highlighting the strategic shift of oil companies towards prioritizing shareholder distributions over rapid production growthEOG with its extensive reserves operational efficiency robust balance sheet and consistent dividends is one of the best ways to play the bullish oil caseThe companys commitment to prioritizing shareholder value has yielded impressive returns outperforming peers energy ETFs and the broader marketAs oil dynamics evolve EOGs prudent approach could likely sustain its outperformance making it one of my top

319,Microchip Technology: Business To Bite The Bullet For Weak H2 2024,I am recommending a hold rating for Microchip Technology  as I expect the nearterm 2H24 quarters to be very weak performing The weak performance will certainly impact share price sentiment especially if the downcycle impact isEmbedded control solutions such as microcontrollers and memory products are among MCHPs many specialties After merging with Microsemi in 2018 MCHP was able to significantly increase its product offerings and market share Because of this merger MCHPs revenue jumped from around 34 billion before the merger to 84 billion in FY23 aMCHP saw a 17 increase in revenue in  totaling 229 billion The company also reported a nonGAAP gross margin of 684 and nonGAAP EPS of 164 By division MCHPs sales increased by 24 in the MCU sector to 131 billion by 20 in the Analog sector to 695 million and by 13 in the Others sector to 281 millionBased on my outlook on the business I believe the business is at best fair valued in the near term I am modeling a very generous assumption for FY24 flattish growth giving MCHP the benefit that the bulk of normalization impact will come in 2H24 Suppose 2H24 negative decline nets off the positive 1H24 growth I believe the stock is worth 75 at 13x forward PE MCHP is currently trading at 13x forward PE which I expect to remain at this level as the market should already be expecting a decline in the near term management is effectively communicating to the investing community However I would note that the stock could see further downside if the normalization impact is a lot larger than what I expected this is hard to quantifyMCHP is returning to a more typical supply and demand environment after several quarters of a robust backlog for microcontrollers which served as a cushion during a period of slowing macroeconomic conditions This means that deliveries will closely mirror consumer needs Since shipments are currently adjusting to the lower demand in the market I am pessimistic about the near future In addition many of MCHPs clients across different application sectors are sitting on unusually high stockpiles refer to  As a result of all of these factors working together I see MCHP in a situation where cyclical demand is low customer inventory levels are high and is going to comp against an exceptionally successful period in the past few quarters Also with such strong and fast growth over the past few quarters there is reason to believe that the downturn will be more severe than normal If events play out as I expect it could have a negative impact on investor sentiment in the second half of 2024My belief above can be well inferred and seen in the 1Q24 results In early June management noticed a gradual decline in performance due to weakerthananticipated growth in China the automotive and industrial sectors and Europe In line with their comments management has provided forward guidance of a 1 sequential decline for 2Q24 and an even larger than seasonal sequential decline for 3Q24 Further confirmation of nearterm weakness can be seen from the  that management attended Note that the date of the conference is September 6 which means management already has 2 months worth of data for 2Q24 At the conference management restated their previous comments about the gloomy shortterm demand outlook pointing to the continuing slowdown in China and to a lesser extent in Europe They also mentioned how customers still wanted to be pushed back bookings were slow and lead times were becoming more typical Notably management also reaffirmed that the December quarter is predicted to see a larger drop in revenue than is typical for the period With this much information in the bag I believe it is wise to avoid this incoming freight train and wait for a better time before investingIf youre one of the many investors betting on MCHPs ability to raise prices to compensate for a drop in volume you might like to know that the company has been doing just that for the past few years Management indicated at the tech conference that future prices may remain relatively unchanged However there are many knobs that management can turn so I anticipate a smaller decline in earnings than revenue Employee bonuses which have been on an upward trend were cited as a potential source of savings if the economic climate were to worsenI think it is inevitable that revenue and earnings will fall from here The potential upside risk is that the entire economy goes into a massive bull run for whatever reason thereby driving up underlying demand This would certainly push out the downcycle leading to positive stock price momentum in the near termIn conclusion I recommend a hold rating for MCHP due to my pessimistic outlook for its nearterm performance in the second half of 2024 The company which specializes in embedded control solutions experienced a significant revenue increase after its merger with Microsemi in 2018 but is now facing challenges as it transitions to a more typical supply and demand environment With lower demand in the market and many of MCHPs clients holding high levels of inventory the company is likely to encounter a more severe downturn compared to typical cycles Managements guidance and comments confirm this outlookWhile there is a potential upside risk if the overall economy experiences a significant upturn driving increased demand I advise potential investors to stay on the sidelines for now and wait for more information on the depth of the downturn

320,Ciena: Path To Recovery But Undervalued By The Market,Ciena Corporation  is a prominent global provider of networking solutions and services Specializing in highcapacity network equipment software and services CIEN plays a pivotal role in enabling highspeed data and communications networks for telecommunications providers enterprises data centers and government agenciesCIENs exceptional performance can be attributed to several pivotal factors This includes the successful conversion of a substantial backlog stemming from supply constraints Furthermore CIENs diverse revenue streams spanning various sectors underscored its broad market appealDuring recent discussions CIEN emphasized the enduring demand for bandwidth fueled by transformative technologies positioning the company to seize expanding market opportunities Notably CIENs strong fundamentals stand out when compared to its peers making it undervalued in comparison Based on these considerations I recommend a buy rating for CIENSince 2020 CIENs revenue growth has been stagnant The company encountered challenges mainly because of the COVID19 pandemic which disrupted global supply chains and impacted customer demand Furthermore these supply chain disruptions affected the delivery of products The competitive dynamics of the networking and telecommunications industry also played a role with CIEN manoeuvring through this landscape The companys 6year revenue CAGR is approximately 4 Regarding gross margins CIEN has demonstrated stability maintaining an average of approximately 44 This consistency indicates that the company has been able to effectively manage its costs relative to its revenue over the period in question Maintaining a consistent gross margin is a testament to CIENs operational efficiency and effective cost management strategiesIn its recent quarterly results CIEN announced a robust revenue of  billion reflecting a 23 yearoveryear growth This surge can be attributed to Cienas substantial backlog from prior periods a result of supply constraints As the company converted this backlog into revenue it also led to notable market share gains The underlying demand drivers for their business continued to be strong and there was a progressive alignment between supply and demandFurthermore CIENs revenue streams diversified across cloud providers service providers and nontelco entities indicate a broad market appeal The significant growth in direct cloud provider revenue of 39 and the diversification strategy reduce the companys dependency on any single segment ensuring multiple avenues for growth This adaptability and ability to tap into various market segments are crucial for navigating future market shifts and uncertaintiesDuring the earnings call CIEN emphasized the consistent and growing demand for bandwidth driven by technological advancements such as 5G cloud computing and AI This trend is not a fleeting one its expected to continue positioning CIEN to further capitalize on this demand in the coming years The everincreasing need for bandwidth combined with the broader technological trends suggests a growing market for CIENs solutions As industries continue to digitize and rely more on cloud and AI solutions this demand is set to rise offering CIEN a vast landscape of opportunitiesStrategically CIENs expansion with a major US Tier 1 customer is poised to be a key driver of future revenue growth Tier 1 customers are pivotal for businesses as they contribute substantial revenue as evidenced by one that nearly reached the 10 thresholdThis partnership combined with the companys forwardthinking approach to sustainability enhances its brand image and appeal As the global emphasis on sustainability and environmental responsibility grows CIENs commitments in this area can serve as a significant advantage ensuring compliance with future environmental regulations and appealing to ecoconscious partners and customers Overall CIENs performance combined with the insights from the earnings call paints a promising picture of its outlook The company seems wellpositioned to capitalize on future market opportunities driven by consistent bandwidth demand strategic partnerships and a diversified customer baseBased on my DCF model I forecast CIENs fair value to be 4802 This valuation is underpinned by the companys impressive recent quarterly performance which has benefited from the alleviation of supply constraints Furthermore the escalating demand for bandwidth propelled by technological innovations bodes well for future revenue growth especially as industries increasingly transition to digital platforms and lean heavily on cloud and AI solutions Additionally CIENs strategic partnership with a prominent Tier 1 service provider further solidifies its outlook for revenue expansionAmong the peers considered in this comparison are F5  and Extreme Networks  These peers exhibit a median forward PE multiple of 134x along with a median expected revenue growth rate of approximately 10 for the next twelve months NTM and a DebttoEquity DE ratio of 119Now shifting our focus to CIEN its forward PE also stands at 134x Furthermore CIEN boasts an NTM revenue growth rate of  9 and maintains a DE ratio of 54 While CIENs NTM revenue growth rate aligns with the peers median it notably features a lower DE ratio This leads me to believe that its forward PE multiple appears undervalued and I expect its valuation to trend towards the peers higher end of 146x Using the 146x PE the implied upside is 14 Therefore I recommend a buy rating for CIENOne potential downside risk is that the current robust revenue growth fueled by increasing demand and the alleviation of supply chain constraints may prove to be shortlived and not indicative of a sustainable longterm competitive advantage as CIEN believes Another downside risk could be that the expansion with a major Tier 1 service provider may not yield as much market share or revenue as anticipatedIn conclusion CIENs recent quarterly results reflect its strength in various aspects The significant backlog resulting from supply constraints has contributed to its robust performance Additionally the consistent and growing demand for bandwidth driven by technological advancements positions CIEN well for the future As industries increasingly embrace digitalization and rely on cloud and AI solutions this demand is expected to continue risingCIENs diversified revenue streams reduce its reliance on any single segment ensuring multiple growth opportunities The strategic expansion with a major service provider not only strengthens its position for future revenue growth but further establishes its position to become a market leaderMoreover the undervaluation of CIENs valuation which suggests an expected trend toward the peers higher end supports a buy rating for CIEN These combined factors create a favourable outlook for the companys future prospects

321,Standard Lithium: A North American Lithium Play Still Far Out From First Revenues,Investing in lithium has been on many investors minds in the last few years as the necessity of it in the transition to renewables and EV vehicles is great Lithium batteries have long been aBut there is a lack of revenues from the company as it is still in its early stages of operations There has been solid progress on the back of the South West Arkansas lithium project commencing drilling programs What has investors interested in SLI is the fact that they seem to have some ofThere is a notable and widespread effort to secure rare earth minerals supplies of China particularly in Western countries As industries increasingly shift towards renewable energy sources and the production of electric vehicles EVs the demand for various critical materials including lithium has surged However China still holds a dominant position in the lithium market which poses a significant concern for Western countries due to the risk of overreliance on a single sourceThe transition towards renewable energy and EV has driven a substantial increase in the demand for lithium a crucial component for battery production With the EV growing at a rapid pace the demand for lithium is expected to continue its upward trajectory potentially leading to supply constraints and subsequent upswings in the commoditys priceIn recent years we have witnessed periodic fluctuations in the commodity price due to shifts in supply and demand dynamics As the demand for EVs and renewable energy technologies continues to outpace initial expectations the pressure on the lithium supply chain intensifies This upward pressure on the commodity price may create challenges for industries reliant on lithium as higher input costs could impact profitability and supply chain stabilityDiversifying the sources of rare earth minerals including lithium has emerged as a strategic imperative for Western countries Efforts to explore and develop sources of these critical materials are gaining momentum as a means to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers particularly China Furthermore investing in recycling technologies and sustainable mining practices could play a pivotal role in mitigating supply constraints and alleviating the potential impact of future commodity price fluctuationsSLI has not yet disclosed the specific capital expenditure required for the construction of the commercial lithium plant or the resources allocated to support the Direct Lithium Extraction DLE technology As such there remains uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of this ambitious initiative In light of this it is reasonable to consider that the company might opt to raise additional capital through stock dilution to fund this critical projectStock dilution while a viable funding option comes with its own set of considerations It involves issuing new shares to raise capital which in turn dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders As a result the increased number of outstanding shares could potentially impact earnings per share and lead to a temporary downward pressure on the stock priceWhere I think a lot of the priority for investors should be is the financial state of the business Maintaining a strict capital allocation program is key here to properly execute the business plan and not risk having to significantly dilute shares to raise capitalThe company has a broad set of projects that they manage and are developing The total operating income for 2022 was a negative 305 million and the TTM has been improved to a negative 24 million instead Looking at the cash position that SLI has right now its sitting at 67 million as of the  This is creating a pretty scary situation I think as the operating income indicates that SLI has around 2  3 years left of funds only So securing more capital from investors will be a key priority A failure in doing so will likely send the stock price downThe hopes for SLI seem quite great given the market cap of 800 million without actually having generated any revenues yet What I think is supporting the valuation is the fact that lithium prices are likely to grow substantially over the coming years and what SLI might be able to produce today will likely be far higher in 2030 for example That is also creating a difficult situation for analysts as assessing the true value of SLI is very difficult I tend to lean on a more riskcautious side and dont want to overextend myself and make this company out to be a strong buy Until we see profitability I wouldnt be an investor Its an approach I bring with me to all investment opportunities and SLI is no different But for the more risktolerant investor in 20 years SLI if they have successfully executed their plans will have likely produced a fantastic ROIInvesting into lithium has been a very hot topic and lithium battery makers have been getting a lot of hype as a result Sometimes going with the more established companies is better or the miners produce the raw materials Here investors are seeing SLI as such an opportunityThe market cap sits very high at 800 million without any revenue being generated yet This is creating a pretty situation where investing based on fundamentals is impossible SLI is a speculative investment I think and one that I would rather rate as a hold than buy for now   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular

322,TORM: The Company Has Strong Financials And Market Outlook For H2 2023,Figure 1  TRMDs leverage conditionTo support the companys capability of higher growth and shareholder returns it is worth noting that TORM has reached its highest free cash flow in recent years The companys cash from operations surged to circa 820 million in TTM versus 502 million at the end of 2022 which aligned with 393 million of capital spending resulting in approximately 427 million of free cash flow This improvement demonstrates the managements capability of generating stable distributions even in times of higher commodity prices see Figure 2 Moreover TORM is going to pay a dividend payment of 15 per share and based on their 82500000 outstanding shares it will lead to approximately 124 million of distribution payment which is easily selffunded by their free cash flowFigure 2  TRMDs free cash flow in millionsNotwithstanding a healthy financial position the company expects to generate lower earnings at the end of the third quarter versus the second quarter In other words by midAugust they covered 74 of the third quarter at 30534 per day which shows lower rates than the second quarter as a result of refinery maintenance product stock draws and slightly lower demand for products However we expect the markets to recover and we expect a stronger fourth quarter The Figure 3 After analyzing TORMs cash and leverage conditions we realize that the company is in a healthy position to perform well even in periods of volatile commodity prices Albeit the management declined their EBITDA generation  from 7501100 million for the end of 2023 due to the current fleet size including published acquisitions and divestments of vessels their stock valuation is still undervalued As Figure 4 demonstrates even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of 837 million which is the middle of their expected range their fair value would reach 28 per share It is worth mentioning that during the last five years the companys net debt level grew by 47 on average However as they have generated a good amount of free cash flow in the first half of 2023 their net debt level might decrease more if the management decided to direct the free cash flow to pay back its net debtFigure 4  TRMD stock valuationIt is crucial to note that a high portion of TORMs revenue is from its product tanker fleet As a result even small volatility in supply and demand in this market and their impact on freight rates may significantly affect the companys cash flows and operations Moreover TRMD employs the majority of its vessels on spot voyage charters on shortterm charters As a result it generates a significant portion of its revenues from the spot market Therefore the company needs to receive profitable spot charters while the spot market is too volatile Therefore a sudden decrease in spot charter rates may adversely affect the companys profitability and ability to meet its obligationsOPEC announcement regarding production cuts and its impact on higher commodity and refined products prices caused TORM stock price decline in the previous months However TORMs strong financial condition and stability protect the company from the volatility of commodity prices to a great extent In addition Europes lower stockpile from their average levels and higher seasonality demand will bring upside to the product tanker market in the second half of 2023 Ultimately even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of 837 million which is the middle of their expected range their fair value would reach 28 per share When all is said and done I believe that TORM stock is still a valuable investment decision   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,22,2023-09-12,0
323,"Federal Reserve likely has more work to do, Dallas Fed's Lorie Logan says",The significantly lower inflation in recent months is encouraging But lower inflation isnt necessarily lowenough inflation Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Thursday in a speechThat means that Federal Reserve officials have to ask whether its current policy rateWhile the headline monthly inflation rate has been at 25 in the past couple of months other measures that strip out volatile food and energy prices show a higher level The average core inflation rate over the past three months was 29 and the Dallas Fed trimmed mean inflation rate was 28 during that period These numbers indicate it is too soon to confidently say inflation will trend to 2 in a timely way Logan saidSimilar to the moderating inflation labor market conditions also show signs of a better balance in supply and demand Still the US economy is adding on average 150K jobs per month exceeding the number of workers entering the labor forceIf stronger economic activity continues it could lead to a resurgence in inflation Logan said At the same time she urged policymakers to proceed with cautionTighter financial conditions might slow the economy without much further action by the FOMC And there are risks to doing both too little and too much she said Strong July economic data could be a blipThe Federal Open Market Committee skipped a rate increase in July and another skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month But the Fed will be on watch to see if inflation resurges and use its tools as neededThe FOMC will need to keep the water bucket close at hand and we must not hesitate to use it as necessary But we must also gather the necessary information to use our tools well she said,57,2023-09-07,0
324,"Pioneer Natural Resources: Gushing Cash, Selling Put Options Optimal",Pioneer Natural Resources  has been on a tear latelyUp more than 34 since midMarch the midsized Oil  Gas production company has surged in price on the back of two impressive earnings reports in addition to a resurgent underlying oil marketWhile we like the company and believe that management has done a good job steering the ship the stock has gotten more expensive relative to itself historically as well as against market peersThats why at the present moment we think that selling put options on PXD stock is the most optimal way to trade this companySelling puts allows investors to generate immediate income and have lowervolatility exposure to the stock while retaining the opportunity to scoop up shares if they dip in price too precipitouslyToday well take a deeper look intoLets dive inAs always lets begin with the companys Financial ResultsAs we just mentioned PXD recently reported a few solid quarters of earningsRevenue fell earlier this year as 2022s hot oil market has cooled but the company has continued to crank out estimatebeating EPS for the last several quartersIn Q1 PXD produced 521 in EPS vs an estimate of 498In Q2 they beat again with reporting EPS of 449 25 cents above estimatesInterestingly this performance came at a time of broader market uncertaintyIn short PXD outperformed in what was ostensibly a poor market for oil and its derivatives heres what PXD management themselves about their end market opportunity for the first half of 2023While the company has outperformed expectations which is a sign of solid management cash conversion and drilling efficiency the company hasnt been immune to the slowdownZooming out nominally PXDs TTM revenue has fallen and Q2 YoY revenue was down more than 33 This dip has impacted cash flow causing a noticeable dip in TTM FCF profitabilityWhile the outperformance is nice theres only so many levers an oil company can pull when the market is fighting youTime for some good newsSince PXDs last report oil has picked back up in price on the back of increased demand and continued supply snarls from the UkraineRussia situationSince the end of June the liquid commodity has rallied more than 37Record demand and supply issues have led to  which bodes well for producersWednesday the Energy Information Administration had the following to sayThis ongoing supply demand and inventory situation has led to a surge in oil stocks across the board PXD included as the outlook of higher for longer should lead to continued opportunities especially for larger competent drillersHowever this has caused us some concern around the valuationNominally many would call PXD cheap The company trades at 26x Revenue 11x free cash flow and sports net margins in the mid 20sHowever as you can see from the graph above PXD has gotten more expensive as of late The companys sales multiple has expanded above the midpoint of the linear regression and FCF is beginning to look uncompetitive with other oil peers especially on the crucial FCF multipleTrading at 55x CF the company is no longer a value gem its in the middle of the packThis is something that Seeking Alphas Quant Rating system agrees with as PXD is currently rated a DThus when taken together its clear that PXD is a wellrun company with significant opportunities ahead of it as oil continues to rally and business conditions improve However the stock isnt a compelling value and the dividend at 206 is quite lowWhats the best way to trade itIn our view the best way to take advantage of PXD is by using the stock as a solid underlying platform for selling put optionsIn case youre unaware when you sell a put option youre agreeing to buy the stock at a given price the strike price if the stock price finishes under the strike priceIn return for the obligation of doing so you earn a cash premiumThink of it like selling insurance on a stock  the stock goes up you keep the cash The stock goes sideways you keep the cash The stock goes down precipitously you get to buy up shares at a significantly lower breakeven point vs todays marketThis solves our income dilemma and our valuation dilemma as a lower entry point would likely lead to a more attractive margin of safetyAs a result we like the December 15th 215 strike put optionsTheyre currently trading at 440 which represents a cashoncash return of 209 or 96 annualizedWith a 78 probability of worthlessness by option expiry they seem like a great winwin way to play the stockAs always there are some risks associated with a trade like this  chief among them the fact that the company is expected to report earnings on November 7thThis is before our option expires and even if the stock does end up beating expectations you never know how the market will  to those numbersThis risk profile is no different than simply owning the shares outright but its important to mention that put sellers in some cases may be forced to buy PXD stock above market depending on how the next 74 days goAll in all we like the outlook for PXD but were not in love with the companys capital return policies or the mixedexpensive valuationThus we think selling put options is the best winwin to play the stock  either a solid cash premium earned or a much better entry point into this medium term winnerIf you

325,Buy Teladoc: AI Will Likely Spur Healthcare Deflation,The first step in my investment process is to identify secular trends One of the biggest secular trends on the planet is aging demographicsAs populations get older national healthcare expenses increase The four largest economies the United States European Union China and Japan areAnother secular trend Artificial Intelligence is the likely cure for rising healthcare costs In testing AI diagnostic platforms we are seeing AI significantly outperform doctors in diagnosis and prescribing treatment plans Integrating AI with traditional medicine will be the key to getting AIs full benefits stands to be a leader in utilizing AI in bringing down healthcare costs Its expansive data and reach combined with AI will make it aTeladoc shares are my top pick for best AI investment of the next year in general and in healthcare specifically It is vital that Teladoc and others succeed in bringing deflation to the healthcare system I think they willThere are three core problems in healthcare that are driving up pricesHealthcare inflation has outpaced the general consumer price index in the past four decades since the healthcare system was shifted away from nonprofits in the 1980sAccording to a  review of CPI data Even if we had more nonprofits it still would not change the equation much We need a solution that supersedes the more egregious supply and demand imbalances that are only getting worse In addition organizations need room to lower prices while roughly maintaining profits ie higher marginsImplementation of AI could be a large part of the solutions generative AI has the potential and likelihood of unleashing the next wave of productivity I have described this to various professionals seeking input that the easiest way to think of AI is as a super assistantConsider what it will be like in virtually any industry having ready answers and much of the grunt work done for you Bankers can underwrite faster writers can edit faster doctors can diagnose faster and with greater accuracyAccording to McKinsey AI could reduce annual healthcare costs by a quarter trillion dollars per year imminently I think over time that number becomes dramatically bigger with implementation and improvements to the processConsider that the US Federal Deficit sits at about 14 trillion right now If AI can help reduce that it will be incorporated over timeHere I will note that the train has already left the station About two years ago my then 93 yearold grandmother was rehabbing a broken hip While still in the hospital her rehabilitative nurses a traveling nurse other core job was to incorporate AI into the processes at a large local hospital networkAI is coming to healthcareMaybe the biggest benefit of AI for healthcare will be taking various data such as symptoms health history genetics diet etc and making the diagnosis and treatment plan process less time consuming This will help with the labor shortage and potentially help hold the line on what is an out of control wage structure in nursing that has developed over the past decadeHeres an example There are more uses of course from scheduling to information management to treatment coordination across different disciplines for folks treating multiple issues This is exactly what medical systems and providers need to bring total spend down while maintaining margins high enough to support their profitsMcKinsey goes on to suggest that the quarter trillion in imminent savings with better adoption could unlock nearly a trillion in savings per annum eventually As Boomers retire and go on Medicare not only will savings spurred by AI be helpful it will be necessary to prevent the destruction of an already overburdened and too expensive systemTheres no shortage of articles detailing the many ways that AI can assist in healthcare and help bring costs down dramatically I invite you to search and read before being incredulous in the comments section that we can see healthcare deflation soonAnother angle that almost no one is considering for healthcare is the current litigation risk that doctors faceIn todays society litigation risk is so higher that doctors are pushed to make the most minimalistic diagnosis and least intrusive treatment plan possible So it is not always that doctors dont have a good idea of what to do but rather they take the path least risky for themselves and their hospitalsIf the use of AI becomes a standard in healthcare it can be used to mitigate litigation risks This is a massive upgrade to the efficiency of the healthcare system just on diagnosing and prescribing in fewer stepsUltimately the various ways that AI helps create deflation in healthcare will benefit both consumers and providersOver the past decade we have seen all of the major tech companies push into healthcare It was big news when Amazon  then led by Jeff Bezos formed a coalition to find solutions for healthcare Today it is all of the big tech playersTeladoc and Microsoft Corporation  have been partners since Covid They recently expanded their  even more So much so that I will make my first comment on the stock since the opening paragraphs I think Teladoc is a potential takeover target for Microsoft if the government allows it Either way the integrations in their systems are very supportive for TeladocWhat McKinsey talked about above is the next step in Teladocs use of Microsoft technology The new collaboration will see Microsofts Azure OpenAI Azure Cognitive Services and the Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience integrated into Teladocs systemsTeladoc expects a significant reduction in administrative work for doctors nurses and systems This is a margin expander for Teladoc It is also an attraction for more hospitals especially those not in large networks to incorporate TeladocAlready Teladoc does work for half of the Fortune 500 I can see their platform incorporating many more Russell 300 companies who look to manage their healthcare expensesConsider what happens when Teladoc has doctors start using AI across the board versus just at a handful of top hospitals and nurses have such clear treatment plans that their work becomes more efficient Thats another driver for margins and salesI think the most important financial numbers are the revenue and EBITDA jumps of the past yearThats a big jump Remember Teladoc serves about half of the Fortune 500 companies so they are no start upWhile the company has had impressive growth investors have been unhappy with profits Well thats been changing fast Much like Zuckerbergs year of efficiency at Meta Platforms Inc  Teladoc is improving margins a shade over 70 in Q2 AI is a part of that and its just getting startedI would also point to the international opportunity for Teladoc which I think will be bigger than US revenues at some pointThats 28 yearoveryear international growth versus about 8 in the US At that pace Teladoc would have a billion dollars in revenues internationally in a decade Presuming US growth slows somewhat US revenues will be about a billion in a decade as well Thats a spicey AI meatball at 70 or even 60 marginsThere will certainly be competition for Teladoc The one that got the most attention recently was Amazon At this point though Amazon is far behind and deploying a system that is more direct to consumerAmazon is not racing to get into hospitals right now I am sure that will change at some point but Teladoc has a significant head startI also see Amazon as a bigger player in attracting small companies initially In particular very small companies that use the Amazon platform for sales Thats where they have inroads already In addition Im sure theres some type of urgent care benefit for Prime Members coming that might be tied into Amazon Pharmacy Simply put different animal than TeladocThe cap on Teladocs growth seems to be pretty far into the future at this point We will see what the largest healthcare networks do I suspect many will contract Teladoc and Microsoft for tech support while deploying private labeled systems as building from scratch is no easy chore when cost is considered Well seeI have shown simple charts in recent articles to get folks more comfortable with technical analysis The easiest short cut is to use RSI over longer time frames to find oversold and overbought conditions to ramp up research and decision making investors RDHeres Teladoc on a monthly chartWhat you can see is that the stock has round tripped back to 5year lows You can also sort of see that monthly RSI is oversold Heres a close upYou can see that recently RSI has just started to turn up from absolute oversold if you believe in the fundamental story then it is clearly in buy the dips territoryLets switch over the weekly chart which measures at the end of each week instead of each monthThe first thing that should jump out at you is the long basing period for TDOC Thats a sign of an impending rise if the business continues to do wellNext is that weekly RSI is on a pullback which has to do with a generally weak market this month but also the Amazon news that I dont think really matters but that retail chasers didNext look left Way on the far left is the volume weighted interest There is a lot of interest in this stock down at these price levels Check your favorite 13F source and youll see bigger buyers drifting inTeladoc is set up for a big gain at some point Theres very little resistance for a price jump to climb well over 100 per share in the next few years Big resistance first appears around 130 per share again look leftWhile there will be competition for AI applications in healthcare Teladocs first mover advantage and scale give it an edge In addition having Microsoft at its back plus the ability to incorporate other technology as needed I believe gives Teladoc a margin of safety from these price levelsMembers are also selling cashsecured puts at different expiration dates and strike prices By selling puts I am essentially setting limit prices below todays price and collecting premium The premiums so far have been far above

326,Inflation Is Rapidly Receding - Except For Energy Prices,The two major inflation indicators released last week were a bit hotter than expected but that was mostly due to energy price increases On Wednesday the Labor Department announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rose 06 in August and 37 in the past 12 months butVolatile food prices doubled Augusts 03 overall gains at 06 but energy prices surged 56 and gasoline prices rose by double digits 105 The good news is that owners equivalent rent rose only 03 and 73 in the past 12 months so it appears that shelter costs are finally moderating somewhatSince higher energy prices are the major reason the CPI rose in August I do not expect the Fed to raise rates at its forthcoming Federal Open Market Committee FOMC next weekOn Thursday the Labor Department announced that the Producer Price Index PPI rose 07 in August substantially higher than the analysts consensus estimate of 04 but in the past 12 months the PPI has risen just 16 well below the Feds 2 target rateExcluding food and energy the core PPI rose 02 in August and 22 in the past 12 months Wholesale gasoline prices surged a whopping 20 in August and overall wholesale energy prices rose by 105 Meanwhile wholesale food prices declined 05The other good news was that wholesale service costs only rose 02 in August down from 05 in JulyOne other major report came out on Thursday when the Commerce Department announced that Retail Sales rose 06 in August which was much better than the economists consensus estimate of a 01 increaseExcluding gas station sales however retail sales rose only 02 so retail sales were also warped by rising energy prices Also Julys strong retail sales gain was revised down to a 05 gain from 07After the retail sales report and inflation indicators came out the Atlanta Fed lowered its thirdquarter GDP estimate to a 49 annual pace down from its previous estimate of a 56 annual paceThe other big news last week was that the UAW agreed to strike last Friday which could push the jobless rate above 4 for September The UAW lowered its demand for a 40 pay increase over the next few years to 36 but that remains too high for the Big 3UAW President Shawn Fain repeated his mantra that record profits mean record contracts The UAW has never gone on strike with all of the Big 3 so the real winner in this fight could be Mexico which will now likely generate more vehicle productionIn theory a short strike  say two weeks or so  could help the Big 3 tighten their inventories and stop the excessive discounting of their massive inventoriesAt the end of August Stellantis  Chrysler Dodge and Jeep had a 74day inventory of vehicles Ford  had a 64day supply and GM  had a 50day supply The industry average is 38 daysMeanwhile the UAW is prepared to expand its strike locations depending on how the bargaining progresses UAW President Fain said This strategy will keep the companies guessing It will give our national negotiators maximum leverage and flexibility in bargaining And if we need to go all out we will Everything is on the table But any long strike would mostly help MexicoOn Friday President Biden called on the Big 3 to share more of their profits with the UAW Specifically he said Auto companies have seen record profits including in the last few years because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of UAW workers Those record profits have not been shared fairly in my view with those workersIt will be interesting to see how the Big 3 respond since they are not making money on their EVs which the Biden Administration is mandating they make Something has to give so I suspect the Biden Administration just threw a big wrench into the UAW negotiationss Editorial Board issued a scathing weekend opinion piece titled A UAW Strike Made in Washington subtitled The underlying cause of the auto walkout is the Biden Administrations forced electricvehicle transitionIn addition to Mexico profiting from this strike since it is making the Ford Mache and Chevrolet Equinox EVs Tesla  is also a winner in the EV warsThe painful truth is that until the Big 3 can make money on EVs the UAW is losing leverage Since the Biden Administration is forcing the Big 3 to make unprofitable EVs the UAW strike may be long and painful for all partiesCompounding the problem of the mandated EV production  becoming a massive glut  the had an interesting article entitled The EV car crash is a warning for Europes industrial transitionEssentially this FT article discussed how the Munich Motor Show was dominated by Chinese brands which offered double the EV models they offered in 2021FT also discussed how China is selling quality EVs and is ahead of its European rivals so as the EV transition continues European manufacturers risk being left behindThere is no doubt that Chinese EVs have a big price advantage and will continue to capture market share especially for lowpriced EVs I should also add that Tesla is exporting many of its Model 3 EVs made in Shanghai with LFP batteries to China to continue to capture market shareIn the wake of the G20 meeting there is also talk that Saudi Arabia wants to push crude oil prices up to 100 per barrel Right now global supply and demand are very fragile and any disruption such as a Russian pipeline break or a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico could disrupt crude oil production and send crude oil prices up to 100 I should add that Arab light crude came close 100 per barrel last weekAfter Germanys August wind power auction only offered to develop 14 gigawatts of electricity down from 16 gigawatts at its July auction Britain failed to attract any bids on its latest offshore wind auctionNaturally this is a massive setback for countries like Britain and Germany which are striving to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 Britains Ed Miliband commonly referred to ad Labors shadow climate secretary said that failing to secure any new offshore wind generating capacity is an energy security disasterThe fact of the matter is that bidding on offshore wind projects remains weak since the economics of wind energy are erratic especially if there is a winter cold snap that damages wind turbinesIt appears that the green police were not happy with the recent G20 meeting in India since the  said that G20 leaders were missing in action on a timeline for ending fossil fuel useThe G20 nations account for about 80 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions They did agree on a goal to triple renewable energy sources by 2030 but as Britain and Germanys wind auctions demonstrated there is no reliable economic model to boost wind production so the G20 may might not be able to meet such goalsOther technologies will certainly be feasible in future decades such as satellites with massive solar sails that will be able to transmit solar energy from space but we might also have to still use fossil fuels by then Confused We all are since the planet climate and space are all complex systemsChinas industrial production rose 45 in August and was clearly boosted by higher vehicle production for export markets The other surprising news from China was that retail sales rose 46 in August and were apparently aided by the summer travel seasonAlthough some economic reports are not always reliable from China economists were not questioning the data on industrial production and retail salesThe big news from the G20 was that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni privately signaled that Italy is planning to exit the Belt  Road Initiative with China which is a global infrastructure pactDue to the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping missed the G20 there were plenty of rumblings that China is disengaging with the world President Joe Biden said that China will not be invading Taiwan any time soon since President Xi Jinping has to solve his domestic problems like high youth unemploymentInflation in the eurozone has dropped dramatically from a peak of 106 last year to 53 in August but last Thursday the European Central Bank ECB signaled that its continuing fight against inflation is more important than stimulating economic growth since it raised its key interest rate 025 to 4 the highest level in the 25year history of the common European currencyFood and energy inflation in the eurozone are much more acute than in the US but there is little their central banks can do to combat food and energy inflation so I think the ECB may have made a mistake with its latest rate increaseThe economies of Italy and Germany are based largely on exports and due to Chinas recent economic woes they are contracting this quarter and will likely drag the entire eurozone into a recessionThis euro rate increase will make that outcome more likely so Europe is sinking into a recession while China seems to be avoiding a recession although you can never know how far Beijing can kick that can down the roadAll content above represents the opinion of

327,EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc  is a closedend fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations master limited partnerships and other energy infrastructure companies This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most incomefocused investorsAs regular readers will likely recall we last discussed this fund in midSeptember although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17 2023 That was well before energy prices started to tick up in midJuly so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests We can actually see this by looking at the funds performance which has been substantially better than the broader SP 500 Index  since that article was publishedThe difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the SP 500 Index which provides a boost to its overall investment return When we consider this distribution investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 1226 over the past five months compared to 360 for investors in the SP 500 Index That is a pretty significant difference in results Fortunately there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward although perhaps not quite that strongThere have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article Most importantly the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss Therefore let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an incomefocused portfolio todayAccording to the funds  the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return This makes sense because this is a common equity fund which is immediately apparent in the fact that 9806 of the funds assets are invested in common equityAs I have pointed out in numerous previous articles common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle After all investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of timeIn the case of midstream companies and partnerships a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index  which primarily tracks midstream partnerships Here are the comparison figures for the past yearAs we can see the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 1193 but investors in the fund actually realized a 2131 gain on their investment This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments In many years the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this As such we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciationAs regular readers are no doubt well aware I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site As such most readers should be familiar with the largest positions in the fund Here they areI have discussed all of these companies except for Western Midstream Partners  and Plains GP Holdings  over the years However Plains GP Holdings is simply the general partner and manager of Plains All American Pipeline  which I have discussed quite often As such it should be quite familiar to most readers Indeed all of these companies should be reasonably familiar That is nice because I should not have to point out that many of these are among the best companies in the industryThere is almost certainly one major change to this list that has occurred within the past few weeks however That is Magellan Midstream Partners which recently completed a pending merger with ONEOK  and is no longer an independent company As such it is quite likely that ONEOK has probably replaced Magellan Midstream Partners since the end of August the date that the fund last publicly updated its holdings That is by no means certain however and it is possible that the fund sold off the ONEOK shares that it received in the merger in favor of something else At the moment we do not know exactly what the tenth company is among the funds largest positions This fund has an annual turnover of 6000 so it does a fair amount of trading and it is certainly possible that it sold off the ONEOK sharesIn a few recent articles I have pointed out that there are signs that the American economy may be starting to slow down For example we are starting to see consumers beginning to get tired of their postpandemic spending spree and cutting back Citibank  that consumer spending on credit cards fell 11 in September which represents the fifth consecutive monthly drop and the largest so far When we consider that this period included the back to school season typically a fairly large event for retail spending was weaker than normal this year and prices have certainly not declined this is a very clear sign that one of the last bastions of economic strength has crumbled Fortunately the companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are highly unlikely to be affected by economic weakness This is due to the business model that these companies employ which I discussed in a previous articleThis business model works so well to protect these companies against economic problems that even the COVID19 lockdowns in the Spring of 2020 had no impact on most of their cash flows While we did see several of these companies reduce their distributions in response to that event that was simply because the capital markets did not want to touch anything related to the oil and gas industry These companies simply cut their distributions in order to pay off their debt and become selffinancing As I have pointed out in many previous articles though their cash flow was almost completely unaffected It seems likely that the same would be the case in another economic downturn such as what might be coming As we will see in a moment energy prices could increase going forward which would put further pressure on consumersAs we already saw the cash flows of the midstream companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are not significantly impacted by energy prices If they were then these companies would not have handled the COVID19 lockdowns as well as they did However their equity prices do still correlate with oil prices to a certain degree It is not a perfect correlation but we can still see one in this chartThis chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against the Alerian MLP Index in orange and the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund in blue over the past twelve months We can see that crude oil prices are much more volatile but for the most part increases in crude oil prices caused the price of both the fund and the index to increase and vice versa Thus the fundamentals of energy prices are still relevant to our discussion of this fund as an investmentFortunately the fundamentals of crude oil right now are very positive primarily because energy companies in aggregate have been underinvesting in productive capacity since 2015 There are several reasons for that including various parties in the market refusing to provide energy prices investor aversion towards fossil fuels government incentives meant to promote renewable energy and various other things As a result of this underinvestment crude oil production is not likely to be as high as it would have been had suitable amounts of capital been invested This poses a problem because most sources right now expect that crude oil demand will not drop off nearly as rapidly as environmental activists and politicians believe The truth is that renewable technology is nowhere near where we need it to be in order for it to work as a suitable replacement for hydrocarbonsAs a result the production of crude oil is likely to be lower than demand over the coming years JPMorgan Chase recently predicted that the global demand for crude oil will be 11 million barrels above the production level by 2025 and 71 million barrels above the production level by 2030The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries recently made similar statements The organizations  stated that the energy industry needs to invest approximately 14 trillion into upstream midstream and downstream capacity by 2045 in order to avoid a catastrophic energy shortage That is to put it mildly highly unlikely to happen considering that many politicians and activists are trying to curtail investment into productive capacityThere may be some readers who point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is simply talking up its own book with its statements about a midterm shortage of oil That is certainly possible but private companies such as JPMorgan and Moodys are saying the exact same thing Thus it is something that we can probably take seriouslyThe laws of supply and demand imply that a shortage of crude oil would have the effect of raising crude oil prices As we have already seen there appears to be a correlation between the price performance of midstream companies the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund and crude oil Thus there is reason to believe that this situation will have a positive effect on the share price of this fund over the midtolong termAs mentioned earlier in this article the primary objective of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is to provide its investors with a high level of total return In order to accomplish this the fund invests primarily in midstream companies and partnerships These are companies that deliver a significant percentage of their total return in the form of direct payments to the shareholders As a result they tend to have high yields For example the Alerian MLP Index yields 813 at the current price The ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund collects these distributions and pays them out to its own shareholders along with any capital gains that it manages to realize As such we can assume that this fund would have a fairly high distribution yield itselfThat is certainly the case as the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund currently pays a quarterly distribution of 065 per share 260 per share annually which gives it an 860 yield at the current price This is a very reasonable yield for a fund like this and it is sufficiently high to appeal to any incomefocused investor Unfortunately the fund has not been especially consistent with respect to its distribution over the years As we can see here it has had to make a few large cuts over its lifetime although it has generally been boosting its distribution since 2020The fact that the fund has not obtained a perfect track record with its distribution could be something of a turnoff to investors who are seeking a safe and consistent source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles However as I explained earlier in this article several midstream companies cut their distributions in 2020 despite their cash flow remaining stable In addition companies in the industry saw their equity prices collapse These two factors reduced the amount of money coming into the fund and forced it to take substantial unrealized losses Thus it makes sense that the fund had to cut in response to these events Fortunately we can see that it has been increasing its distribution now that the sector has largely recoveredNaturally though anyone who purchases the fund today will receive the current distribution at the current yield and will not be adversely affected by the distribution cuts that the fund was forced to impose in the past As such the biggest concern for investors today is how well the fund can sustain its current distribution Let us investigate thisFortunately we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis As of the time of writing the funds most recent  corresponds to the sixmonth period that ended on May 31 2023 This is a newer report than the one that we had the last time that we discussed this fund which is quite nice to see After all during the first half of this year crude oil prices were generally much lower than they were in either 2022 or recently This weighed somewhat on midstream stocks and likely made it much more difficult for the fund to earn capital gains than it experienced in 2022 This report will thus show us how the fund performed in such an environment and seeing how a management team handles a challenging environment is a very important part of determining its overall skill After all anybody can make money in a raging bull marketDuring the sixmonth period the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund received 23247909 in dividends and distributions along with 178049 from the money market funds storing its cash The fund reported no interest during the period One characteristic of midstream partnerships is that their distributions are not considered to be income to the fund so the fund only had a total investment income of 4936584 during the period This was not enough to cover the funds expenses and it ended up reporting a net investment loss of 5316691 over the course of six months Obviously that was nowhere near enough to pay any distribution but the fund still handed out 13682401 to its shareholders At first glance this is almost certainly going to be very concerningHowever the fund does have other methods through which it can obtain the money that it needs to cover the distribution For example the fund received 18787159 in distributions from master limited partnerships during the period That money was not considered to be income for tax purposes but it still represents money coming into the fund The fund also might have been able to get some capital gains that can be paid out Unfortunately it was not successful at this task as it only reported net realized gains of 8290562 but this was more than offset by 42384338 net unrealized losses Overall the funds assets declined by 56823422 after accounting for all inflows and outflows during the period Thus it failed to cover its distributions overall which is worrying However the funds net assets were still up over the trailing eighteenmonth period In short the fund made enough money over the course of 2022 to cover all of its distributions for that year and make up the difference for the first half of 2023 Thus the distribution is probably reasonably safe right now especially considering that the past few months have given it the possibility of having more gainsAs of October 6 2023 the most recent date for which data is available as of the time of writing the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has a net asset value of 3497 per share but the shares only trade for 3117 each As such the funds shares are currently trading at a 1087 discount on net asset value This is a very large discount although it is nowhere near as attractive as the 1291 discount that the shares have had on average over the past month As such it might be possible to obtain a better price by waiting a bit However realistically a doubledigit discount is generally a reasonable price to pay for any fund so the current price is probably acceptable if you want to own some sharesIn conclusion the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is a reasonable way to play the midstream exposure without having to worry about the tax problems that can come along with owning master limited partnerships This fund is structured as a corporation so it handles all the tax issues on the fund level The fund has delivered a respectable performance over the past several months as it has beaten the SP 500 Index and it seems likely that it will continue to do so due to the strong midterm fundamentals for energy The valuation is also reasonable right now The biggest problem here is that the fund failed to cover its distribution during the first half of the year but due to the very strong performance that it delivered in 2022 it is not straining to maintain the distribution Overall this fund might be worth considering for a portfolio todayEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do

328,AGG And TLT: Real Yields Near ATH Reveal The Opportunity,I believe there are numerous reasons to own longterm US Treasury bonds such as  and  While I will concentrate primarily on these three Firstly historical evidence is fairly plain and provides a straightforward perspective on whatThere are several crucial reasons why I chose the AGG and TLT for further analysis As you can see in the table below these are predominantly longterm bonds whose real yields have settled near their highest levels in the past 10 to 15 years indicating my attraction to such a selection AGG has a weighted average maturity of 852 years an effective duration of 613 years and a positive convexity of 065 according to Due to the extremely long duration of TLT every rate increase would be especially vulnerable In spite of the fact that the weighted average yield to maturity is 2521 years the effective duration is 1689 years and the convexity is positive at 38 Due to the positive convexity a further increase in interest rates would be less painful than gains providing the advantage to the long position based on a riskreward approachWhile I was once  on TLT down 7 from the previous analysis based on total return I must confess that I was a little bit premature despite being correct about inflation However the narrative of being long TLT was too speculative because I did not believe the Fed could raise as much as it did at the time However that is precisely what transpired but we will investigate the most significant contributors to nominal yield to identify potential opportunitiesYou can see the contribution of nominal US30Y below as well as the 30Y TIPS yield real yield and 30Y breakeven rates market expectations for the annualized inflation rate for 30 years As can be seen real yields were the driving force in recent months while inflation expectations remained relatively stable Real yields are nearly at alltime highs reflecting the greatest investment opportunity in years Inflation expectations for 30 years are approximately 229 percent which is above the longterm inflation target of about 2 percentConsidering 20year and 10year real yields it appears that we are close to 2008 and 2009 levels Currently rates are pricing the higher for longer theme Nevertheless the Mr market is always subject to change as real yields have been extremely volatile Despite the risks involved I believe it presents a wonderful opportunity from this perspectiveTaking into account the upcoming round of inflationary pressures the Fed may decide to raise rates again Here are the possible driversAlso as a result of these narratives the  GDP model now predicts that the annualized GDP for the third quarter will increase by 58These factors are also responsible for the rapid growth of real yields The latest  SP from last weeks Wednesday may indicate that the service sector is beginning to be less resilient than anticipated along with the composite index as a whole After the release of the data real yields fell considerably across the curve with 20year real yields falling from a local high of 204 to 188 Very impressive change in just a few days However the overall result differs from the ISM PMI indicating a much more negative outlookThe charts below from JPMorgan illustrate the most evident behavior of US10Y before and after the Fed Pause However it is always an estimate as to when the last rate hike will occur so we must take into account current market expectations Although not always accurate and subject to drastic change it is the most objective indicator of what Mr Market believes If not we could perform our own projections In the following chapter we will also examine current market pricing and provide my insights on itThe graph below depicts the behavior of 10year US yields following a Fed pause during nonrecessionary tightening cycles The majority of dates indicate that longterm yields tend to decline The exception is cycle Dec 1966When delving deeper it can be somewhat different when examining the cycles that the recession followed After a few days of the Fed pause yields tended to decline in five of seven cases but in the majority of cases yields recovered On the other hand due to rising risks and instability market behavior was fundamental and conventional Currently or lets say since 2008 the monetary normal is nowhere to be found due to QE and balance sheet expansion Now central banks are attempting normalization but its success will be determined in the future Assuming a soft landing the riskreward profile of owning longterm bonds supports the optimistic narrativeThe average development of longduration bonds since 1981 from JPMorgan via  in the last seven cycles indicates that longduration bonds are clearly advantageous based on history and the event of the most recent fed hike In my opinion we may take one more hike and then be finished or we may not even see that According to JP Morgans calculations a bond with a duration of 15 years or more has an average move in the next 23 months following the last Fed rate increase accumulated a 36 gain And even shortterm bonds performed admirably TLT and AGG are excellent matches for thisPerhaps you are wondering why I am so confident in my opinion As FFR is higher than YoY Core Inflation I believe the Fed has tightened enough While FFR may be in place for some time I am confident that it will be sufficient to tame inflation Most of the time when FFR exceeded Core inflation it was sufficient to pacify it However it is crucial not to reduce interest rates as quickly as policymakers did in the 1970sThese assumptions simply lead me to believe that the Fed is likely finished with rate adjustments On the other hand there are risks associated with a robust economy and solid expenditure or there are leading indicators indicating that services are becoming less resilient and manufacturing is continuing to decline Inflation is below 02 mm for the second consecutive month which is below the 10year monthly average and annualized below 2 thus below the Feds inflation objective Yes as I mentioned there are dangers to the upside but a number of leading indicators point to a greater risk to the downside Nevertheless an indicator of economic activity and food suggest inflation could reboundWhile there are upside inflation risks which were extensively discussed at the most recent  meeting and Jackson Hole I prefer to concentrate on market rate measurement by Fed Funds Futures Simply stated market participants anticipate rates in December 2023 to be close to 543 and in December 2024 to be close to 448 implying a probability that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points under 40 The spread between specified futures reflects the markets expectation of a 100 basis point bps rate cuts from peak rates through the end of December 2024 Obviously these expectations alter over time and in response to events such as last weeks Jackson HoleNonetheless if this pattern of rate cuts materializes it could be a strong positive driver for bonds with maturities of 7 years or more and reduce real yields Assuming that the fight against inflation could be effective real yields and inflation expectations could be positive drivers for lowering nominal and real yields Fed Funds Futures rate expectations imply peak rates in December and November giving us a slightly less than 40 chance of a 25 basis point rate increase at one of the next two meetingsWhile I have provided clear evidence of how the market behaved in analogous situations there is no assurance of the markets future behavior I see limited upside risks in realyields rising by an additional 3050 basis points or more from local yield highs which could be close to alltime highs In my opinion the likelihood of recordbreaking real yields is extremely unlikely though not entirely impossible However real yields premiums could spike if enormous fiscal debt issuance and almost outofcontrol spending occurred which could increase inflation expectations and exacerbate the supplyanddemand imbalanceIf demand is insufficient continued fiscal emissions could lead to an increase in nominal yields if they continue As a result of the Feds quantitative easing QT it may be more difficult for the market to curb such massive emissions I believe mitigating factors exist However such yields are ideal for asset managers and also attractive for retail investors Imagine the following longterm yields 424 percent for 10 years 455 percent for 20 years and 433 percent for 30 years These are the levels that investors and many analysts believed would never be reached again Levels last seen in 2009 Nonetheless this threat persists From a timing perspective I believe there could be a little bit spark up by 1020 bps from current yields which could pull down the AGG and TLT down This could be solid opportunityPowell attempted to be as hawkish as possible but the market was not surprised Fed Chairman confessed that the Fed is  for additional tightening if necessary until it is evident that the inflation target is being metThere is also a significant  that must be addressedPowell has just disclosed that the stillexpanding and resilient economy as indicated by the robust labor market and robust economic expansion could threaten the efforts of central bankers Primarily due to the constrained labor market because in my opinion a tight labor market solely creates wage pressures which drives the price of services Powell is aware of this inflationary pressure which is why the FOMC always seeks to soften the labor market especially in times such as the presentHowever the most recent data from this week  JOLTs Job Openings in the US economy nonfarm  showed a significant decline totalling 8827 million compared to expectations totalling 9465 million Nonetheless the trend remains considerably above prepandemic levels confirming that the labor market remains tight Nonetheless it is softening rapidlyThe Feds decision to halt tightening could be precipitated by a labor market that is easing but remains tight a manufacturing sector that is continuing to weaken and a service sector that is starting to weaken Thus whether or not we see one more increase is less significant for this strategy than the emergence of global and downside risksRegarding the economys resilience in relation to higher bond yields I have one suggestion Despite the fact that the Atlanta Fed GDP model released a very strong piece of forwardlooking GDP for Q3 Im becoming more cautious as the most recent Flash PMI reveals weaker service numbers following many months of resilience The monetary policy delayed effect began to materializeHowever I believe that longterm bonds have an extremely favourable riskreward ratio which is influenced by duration and convexity From a risk perspective it is much more advantageous to initiate fairly severe DCA at this point This also correlated with historical evidence but even historical evidence is never a guarantee of future returns Before investing do your own due diligence Feel free to review my  of the technology sector from July which is ahead of September the most negative month from a seasonality perspective or my most recent ideas  that are

329,"Jackson Hole Symposium Takeaway: Further Rate Increases, If Appropriate",Ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium the SP 500  rallied from around 4333 last week Markets not only wanted to buy the dip for the month but also were willing to gamble on a dovish Federal Reserve A dovish FedSince the Bureau of Labor Statistics posted strong job data Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powells conclusion pointed to that of hawkishness Powell  We will need price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all We will keep at it until the job is doneInvestors who saw their stock holdings lose value in 2022 will have last years symposium fresh on their minds Interest rates increased by 300 basis points sinceAssets soared in March when the Fed stepped in to prevent a bank crisis contagion with Silicon Valley Bank Signature Bank and First Republic Bank Investors will notice a correlation between the asset increase and the stock markets continuing their uptrendMore recently however markets continued to trade higher through midJuly despite the Fed reducing its securities holding Powell recognized that the impact of the asset reduction and rate hikes takes time to show up in the economy The stock markets recent weakness which began in late July mirrors Powells comment Powell said the wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipelinePowell commented on the strong gross domestic product growth in Q22023 He said that the economy might not be cooling as expected citing the housing sector showing renewed strength Rising interest rates discourage mortgage holders on their existing properties from selling their homes The elevated rates will limit home supplies and reduce real estate transaction volumesOnce the Fed pivots it may encourage consumers to buy a home This would support the Feds case to raise rates again In  Powell cited that high inflation starting before 2022 was a collision between very strong demand and pandemicconstrained supply It continues to unwind demand and supply distortions and implement monetary policy tightening to slow the said aggregate demand Unfortunately this is a long process Despite the more favorable recent readings the Fed will continue a ratetightening biasRental costs remain high Powell recognized that lease turnover is slow so rent inflation measurements take time to show up The Fed will watch the market rent data closely It will look for signals of upside and downside risks to housing services inflationPowell welcomed the lower monthly core inflation readings for June and July Still he saw that as only the beginning of what the Fed needs to have confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its goalPowell is unsure that lower core PCE inflation will continue The central bank will need to work down the elevated 12month core inflation Until then the economy did not return to price stabilityTighter monetary policy and resolving supply and demand dislocations helped bring core goods inflation down The Feds actions worked especially well for durable goods such as motor vehicles During the pandemic fiscal transfers and low interest rates boosted the demand for vehicles After the pandemic ended output and inventory increased and demand fell Most importantly interest rates increased the cost of vehicle financing As a result the Fed successfully achieved a sharp decline in motor vehicle inflationIn time inflation should decline for other goods This is nowhere near prepandemic levels As a result it will call for a restrictive monetary policy Powell and the Fed will achieve sustained progress in lowering core goods inflation by keeping interest rates higher for longer than investors thinkNonhousing services which include health care food services transportation and accommodations accounted for more than half of the core PCE index Although the 12month inflation moved sideways Powell is encouraged that its inflation in three and sixmonth measures declined This category is less sensitive to interest rates In addition those services are labor intensive It will take time for the Feds restrictive monetary policy to resolve the inflationary pressure stemming from the imbalance between supply and demandTo achieve inflation rates at 2 Powell expects a period of belowtrend economic growth Readers may track the tighter financial conditions by watching the 2year treasury yield  which is up 250 basis points since last years symposium Tighter bank lending standards are also slowing loan growth He cited evidence of belowtrend growth from slower industry production Additionally spending on residential investments fell in each of the past five quartersPowell again emphasized the economy may not be cooling as the Fed expected GDP figures are above expectations as well as above its longerrun trend Consumer spending is robust Anyone invested in retail stocks like DICKS Sporting Goods  Macys  Foot Locker  or Nike  might disagree But when the consumer is shifting its spending profits fall for some firms and rise for othersPowell said that wage growth across several measures showed a slowdown Yet the Fed needs nominal wage growth slowing at a rate similar to that of its 2 inflation targetReaders should be cautioned that the slower wage growth may not last UPS  workers  Fulltime workers will get an average of 49 an hour Hollywood writers are still on strike while United Airlines  pilots received up to 402 in Powell reiterated the Federal Reserves ultimate 2 inflation target It will stay on its restrictive monetary policy until that time Even though rates are firmly above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate rates will not fall This should keep putting downward pressure on economic activity hiring and inflationThe Fed does not have a certainty in the neutral rate of interest It is a warning for investors that they should ignore

President of Investor Relations and Strategy Please go aheadGood morning and thank you for joining Kimcos quarterly earnings call The Kimco management team participating on the call today include Conor Flynn Kimcos CEO Ross Cooper President and Chief Investment Officer Glenn Cohen our CFO Dave Jamieson Kimcos Chief Operating Officer as well as other members of our executive team that are also available to answer questions during the callAs a reminder statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forwardlooking and it is important to note that the companys actual results could differ materiallyDuring this presentation management may make reference to certain nonGAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimcos operatingAlso in the event our call was to incur technical difficulties well try to resolve as quickly as possible and if the need arises well post additional information to our IR websiteAnd with that Ill turn the call over to ConorThanks Dave and thanks everyone for joining us this morning Im going to lead off today with an overview of the macro environment summarize our operating performance for the quarter and provide an update and some color on our strategy for navigating through these uncertain economic times Ross will cover the transaction markets and Glenn will close with our financial metrics and updated guidanceDespite the headwinds of high interest rates some high profile tenant bankruptcies shaky debt and equity markets and the onagain offagain predictions of an impending recession underlying shopping center sector fundamentals remain robust More importantly our portfolio continues to produce strong operating results as we have been able to nearly overcome from an FFO perspective over 006 of noncash accounting related headwinds relative to last yearIn an environment marked by virtually no new supply strong demand from new recurring traditional and nontraditional anchor and small shop tenants along with the resilient consumer we continue to produce strong operating results Indeed our third quarter results were stronger than anticipated enabling us to raise our outlook for same site NOI while raising the bottom end of our FFO guidance for the remainder of the yearA few more third quarter highlights We signed 457 leases totaling 21 million square feet during the third quarter Our small shop occupancy reached an alltime high of 911 as demand for our portfolio continues Our strong positive leasing spread was 349 for new leases and 88 for renewal and options reflects the pricing power of our high quality portfolio Of note our combined spread of 134 is the highest in six yearsAs anticipated our anchor occupancy dipped 50 basis points quarteroverquarter to 972 due to the recapture of the remaining Bed Bath  Beyond boxes We released seen Bed Bath boxes this quarter at a positive spread of 54 Our remaining 12 Bed Bath boxes are all in negotiation and continue to benefit from the favorable supply and demand dynamic for welllocated retail Our overall occupancy is off only 30 basis points to 955 notwithstanding the headwinds describedWe are encouraged by the continued push by tenants to secure the right real estate with the right landlord This continued strong demand is perhaps best evidenced by our signed but not open spread which actually widened out this quarter to 320 basis points representing about 522 million of rent that is not yet cash flowing It is these operating dynamics in our own portfolio that continue to build our teams enthusiasm for the pending RPT transaction While we remain excited about our portfolio the headwinds I noted earlier cannot be ignored As a result of the dramatic rise in the 10year treasury due to persistent inflation in all likelihood we will remain in a higherperlonger interest rate environment for the foreseeable futureTo mitigate balance sheet uncertainty and maintain a stance of derisking our exposure to market forces we do not Technical Difficulty continue to prioritize generating free cash flow We are laser focused on expediting store openings and rent commencing dates while reducing expenses that are not income producing Free cash flow growth will allow us to be selffunding and help produce strong organic internal NOI growth as we move aheadIn summary we continue to build a company team and portfolio that is resilient and able to drive growth in challenging times We believe we are well positioned to execute and take advantage of the additional opportunities that will inevitably arise as we continue to work to optimize shareholder value RossThank you Conor and good morning all It was a busy quarter for Kimco on all fronts including the transaction side of the business While the macro backdrop continues to be volatile the dislocation that has begun to emerge clearly benefits wellcapitalized owners and operators Those with the scale and liquidity to not only weather challenging times but take advantage of them With rates continuing to rise and financing more difficult to obtain creativity and utilizing unique advantages is how to win in this environmentTo that point in August we capitalized on an opportunity to acquire a dominant grocery anchored lifestyle center in one of our top markets Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center is a 500000 square foot trophy asset in Washington DC Metro with all the attributes we look for in a property starting with the bestinclass grocer in this case Wegmans with exceptional sales The market also has excellent demographics with over 115000 annual household incomes and over 110000 people in a three mile radius that also pulls from a trade area that stretches upwards of 40 miles due to the tenancy and regional locationThe property will allow us to layer in our platform to create additional value and cash flow growth both from upgrading specific tenants and rental levels over time Additionally the asset includes over 50 acres of land providing us with the optionality to densify with mixed use in the future Historically this is an asset that every institutional owner would be chasing and would likely have a premium cap rate attached to it due to all the positive attributesHowever with financing tight and for a large deal size Kimco stood out with its ability to close all cash on the 1725 million purchase price which allowed us to negotiate a cap rate north of 7 for our newest Signature Series assetDuring the quarter we also announced the merger with RPT Realty This is another clear example of utilizing our platform to negotiate a highly favorable cap rate for a wellregarded portfolio of primarily groceryanchored centers Similar to the timing on the Weingarten transaction we view this as another unique window during which the competition is limited and we can take advantage As it relates to structured investments there has been a noticeable uptick in discussions and potential opportunities in the past 30 days to 60 daysAdmittedly we expected these conversations to ramp up earlier in the year but it seems to be happening at a more significant pace as of late Conversations are taking place with operators facing debt maturities groups looking for capital to transact on unique oneoff opportunities as well as institutional investors facing redemptions that are looking at recaps Were being very selective in where we participate so we expect this part of our business to grow as we move forwardAll in all we are excited about the activity during the quarter and our ability to utilize our position and sectorleading liquidity to remain active when others are sidelined We will continue to be extremely judicious with our capital but be ready to move opportunisticallyAnd now off to Glenn for the financial highlights of the quarterThanks Ross and good morning Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our high quality operating portfolio highlighted by robust leasing spreads and positive samesite NOI growth Importantly our strong liquidity position and leverage metrics position us to effectively handle the macroeconomic headwinds resulting from stubborn inflation and the higher interest rate environmentNow for some details on our third quarter results FFO was 2486 million or 040 per diluted share as compared to last years third quarter results of 2545 million or 041 per diluted share Our third quarter results produced an increase in pro rata NOI of 33 million The key components of the increase were higher consolidated minimum rent of 126 million offset by lower LTA income and straightline rent of 47 millionIn addition bad debt expense was higher by 28 million as the current period had a more normalized credit loss level compared to last year which benefited from 600000 of credit loss income due to reversals of reserves Overall credit loss was at 71 basis points as a percent of revenues for the nine months at the favorable end of our 75 basis point to 125 basis point credit loss guidance assumptionPro rata interest expense was also higher by 10 million comprised of 8 million from the consolidated portfolio and 2 million from our joint ventures This was due to lower fair market value amortization resulting from the early repayment of Weingarten bonds in the third quarter of last year and higher interest rates on the floating rate debt in our joint ventures Also included in FFO for the third quarter 2023 are 38 million of costs incurred in connection with the announced RPT merger and a net benefit of 48 million associated with the final liquidation of the Weingarten pension planMoving to the operating portfolio leasing activity remained brisk throughout the quarter as Conor mentioned Samesite NOI growth was positive 26 for the third quarter And if we excluded the impact of prior period collections it would have increased to 31 The primary drivers of the samesite NOI growth are higher minimum rents contributing 290 basis points and other rental revenues adding 40 basis points These increases were offset by a more normalized level of credit loss impacting samesite NOI growth by 90 basis points Overall these results demonstrated the continued strength of our welllocated portfolio and brings our yeartodate samesite NOI growth to 2Turning to the balance sheet we ended the third quarter with consolidated net debt to EBITDA of 55 times On a look through basis including prorata JV debt and perpetual preferred stock outstanding net debt to EBITDA was 59 times the same as last quarter and 04 times better than a year ago Our liquidity position remains very strong at over 24 billion at quarter end This was comprised of more than 400 million in cash and full availability of our 2 billion revolving credit facilityIn addition we have our remaining Albertsons shares which have a value of over 320 million Subsequent to quarter end we issued a new 500 million long 10year unsecured bond which is scheduled to mature in 2034 at a fixed coupon of 64 As we are all aware interest rates have risen dramatically over the past year and further rate increases are not off the table As such we felt it was prudent to address our upcoming 2024 unsecured bond maturities which come due in the first quarter of next year Tending the maturity we have invested the proceeds in highquality instruments to mitigate a large portion of the dilutionNow for our outlook for the remainder of 2023 As Conor noted earlier we began the year facing a noncash headwind of 006 per share totaling 36 million compared to 2022 stemming from the anticipated lower fair market value amortization from the early repayment of the Weingarten bond and the normalization of credit loss In addition we reduced our 2023 lease termination income assumption by 10 million or 002 per diluted share in the first quarterAs a result of the strong performance from the operating portfolio we have clawed most of this back Our ability to overcome these headwinds speaks to the stability and strength of our operating portfolio Based on our yeartodate results and our expectations for the fourth quarter we are again tightening our 2023 FFO per share guidance range to 156 to 157 from the previous range of 155 to 157 This includes improving our fullyear credit loss assumption to a range of 75 basis points to 100 basis points from the previous range of 75 basis points to 125 basis points and increasing our samesite NOI assumption to 175 to 225 from the previous level of 1 to 2In addition based on our full year expectations our board has elected to increase the fourth quarter common dividend to 024 per share representing an increase of 43 As a reminder we received a 194 million special dividend from Albertsons earlier this year which is considered ordinary income for tax purposes but not included in FFO We continue to evaluate the amount of special dividend needed to satisfy our redistribution requirementsThe Board is expected to declare the amount of special dividend in November and we expect to pay it by yearend Looking ahead we plan to provide our 2024 outlook when we report our fourth quarter results We anticipate it will be inclusive of the RPT merger being completed early in the yearAnd with that we are ready to take your questionsBefore we begin QA one additional item of note todays call will be focused on Kimcos third quarter earnings results and outlook as a standalone company Todays discussion may also contain forwardlooking statements about the companys pending merger with RPT which remains subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of RPT shareholders As such our responses around this pending transaction are limited The information that is already publicly available including the transaction announcement the S4 and the merger agreement which can all be found in the investor relations section of our websiteWith that now we can begin the QAWe will now begin the questionandanswer session Operator Instructions The first question today comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS Please go aheadGood morning Thanks a lot for taking my question You purchased an asset in the quarter you sold assets in the quarter youre presumably in the market for selling some of the RPT assets for when you acquire the company Can you kind of provide an update of the transaction market with a particular emphasis on how things have changed since the 10year rate increased ThanksSure happy to address that So yes youre right we had a very active quarter as I mentioned We were very excited about the acquisition of Stonebridge Center Its going to be a longterm hold where we can create some significant value The dispositions on the Kimco side were fairly limited Theres one transaction which I would note that we sold out of one of our joint ventures a grocery anchored shopping center in Southern California at a very low cap rate and the low5s which I think showcases still the strength of the market and that there is significant capital particularly for core grocery centersThat being said were being I think very cautious in this market in terms of the fourth quarter and our expectations Theres essentially nothing in the pipeline on the acquisition side between now and yearend and on the disposition they continue to be limited to a couple of select land parcels and a few smaller joint venture assets that were exploringSo I would tell you that the market is still active although transaction volumes are down plus or minus 70 yeartodate There is still is capital that is being put to work Just recently there were transactions that very aggressive sub6 cap rates in Southern California aside from the one I mentioned that we sold as well as in Miami Weve seen grocery anchoredcenters as well as power centers in Chicago and other parts of the Midwest that are trading in the 6s and the 7s and in some cases low8s The financing is still available albeit at higher rates than what weve seen in the last 12months or so which is obvious given where the rate environment has gone but LTVs can still be obtained from private owners or investors in the 50 to 60 range So theres still activity out there Were encouraged by what we see in the fundamentals of the business as weve talked about And we believe that we can selectively execute it at the appropriate timeThe next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Please go aheadHi Thank you Good morning Just hoping to pack up on the back of Michaels question with regards to targeted RPT dispositions presumably that would be focused in the lower growth Midwest markets Just how committed are you to trying to prune that part of the portfolio if at all And how should we think about cap rate spreads or differences between kind of typical primary gateway markets versus more secondary maybe Midwest or rest Belt type marketsSure we are going to save the specifics of the RPT strategy for once we close the merger That being said I would tell you that there is still activity out there as I mentioned Weve seen transactions in the Midwest as well as in the Sun Belt and other parts of the country So investors are still looking at all parts of the country and all formats of retail Theres a significant amount of capital that is currently sidelined that is waiting for the appropriate opportunities and frankly for more supply to hit the market as its been a pretty stable and static amount of supply thats been introducedSo well be very selective Were going through the integration process the premerger integration process right now So were formulating our strategy but were very encouraged by the direction of the RPT portfolio and what were seeing And as we get to the merger and beyond it well be much more specific about the strategy and plan thereThe next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America Please go aheadGreat Good morning I guess just to push on that a little bit just given the yeartodate stock performance the market is clearly not appreciating the opportunities or the market is too concerned over the risks on these opportunities and it sounds exciting youre seeing more opportunities to come I guess is there anything else you can share today to alleviate maybe some of these concerns that you know Kimco is executing the right strategy to be opportunisticJeff Im happy to take that one so I think when you see in our results and that the numbers speak for themselves clearly we are very focused on executing our strategy and having that result in strong operating results strong FFO we raised our dividend we raised our guidance we raised our samesite NOI guidance the alltime high occupancy for small shops is reflected there sixyear high on leasing spreads So we believe were executing and were showcasing it and letting the numbers speak for themselvesClearly were in an opportune time you know with the dislocation in the financing market we try and be you know opportunistic And I think thats what Kimco is known for And so obviously its a show me story and we believe weve executed in the past and we know were only as good as our last deal and so were going to make sure that we continue to put up the numbers that speak for themselves And when you look  and I know weve been very vocal about the health of our industry but when you look at the supply and demand side of the shopping center sector with the demand the store openings of what we track over 6900 new store openings for this year the supply of 05 of existing stock of new construction which is the lowest amongst all commercial real estate categories and the vacancy levels for the whole entire open air sectorDepending if you look at Cushman and Wakefield or CBRE its the lowest sense of ever been tracking So between 16years at Cushman 18 years at CBRE this is the lowest vacancy rate the country has ever experienced And so were in a good spot We see that opportunity We think that the RPT transaction is exactly that Its a high quality portfolio with all the wind at its back So we can crystallize the GNA synergies very quickly And what gets us most excited obviously is the OpEx margin that we can believe we can execute on quickly and bring it up to a Kimco level and block and tackle and showcase what the platform can doGreat Thank youThe next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi Please go aheadHey guys Just maybe coming at things from another angle on RPT here Just the 10years up called 70 bps since you guys announced the transaction you guys just did the debt deal at 64 ph you have to refinance the under 80 million Could you just talk about given where rates are where they could go what the optimal mix of cash versus new debt could look like to take that debt out and maybe how the accretion math has moved since the deal was announced just given the higher financing costsYes hi Craig its Glenn Again rates obviously have moved a little bit but we do have a full mix and we have a fair amount of optionality We have cash obviously that is on our balance sheet We also have our Albertsons investment that we would expect to be able to monetize in the beginning part of the year So between that our access to capital the revolver we feel pretty comfortable with taking you know refinancing the debt at prices relatively close to where we targeted Rates are up a little bit but I think from a full standpoint we still expect the transaction to be FFOaccretive in the first yearWe have again the revolver is fully available Were sitting with the significant amount of cash on the balance sheet and Albertsons I think those give us the flexibility to take down what we need to doThe next question comes from Haendel St Juste with Mizuho Please go aheadHey there Good morning I will not ask a question on RPT I wanted to ask about leasing spreads My question for you is on leasing spreads the Bed Bath spread in particular which were stronger I think than many of us expected So maybe can you shed some more color here Are you perhaps offering a bit more TIs Are you cutting up boxes And maybe some color on how the conversations are going to backfill the remaining boxes and expectations for spreads on those ThanksYes appreciate the question I think it sort of dovetails part of what Conor mentioned about the supply demand and the demand factors that are very much in our favor right now with no new development supply Its really the existing inventory And so similar message to what weve communicated previously is a lot of these retailers are looking for opportunities to grow their store count They have to hit their growth projections over the next several years and so theyve always seen the Bed Bath inventory as one of those clear opportunitiesSo in terms of the commitment theyve made you have multiple players at the table looking for a similar space that actually helps you push rent northward which helps drive the spread When you look at the cost side the costs have been pretty much in line All of these have been single tenant backfills so we arent splitting boxes yet When you look at the balance of the 12 we still have a handful of those that are going to be occupied most likely by single tenant users There may be a couple in there that we anticipate splitting but that was to be expected from the very beginning and we still see very healthy spread margins as well for those remaining boxes So again all looks fairly comparable right nowThe next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI Please go aheadYes Hi good morning Maybe a followup to the Bed Bath sort of comment earlier I guess how much  how should we think about the downtime with those boxes I mean Im trying to figure out you know the downtime and how long itll take to get kind of the rent back online with new tenants as we think about growth for next year you know So you know on the one side you have the headwinds from higher interest rates net interest expense but on the other side Im just trying to understand how much of a sort of a pickup from rents youll get sort of as a tailwind for next year ThanksYes sure absolutely So we have 14 boxes that were executed three of which were assigned those 14 boxes are accounted for currently in our snow pipeline which you spend a 320 basis points 52 million in total For some perspective on timing we do actually have our first two Bed Bath boxes that were backfilled starting to flow this quarter and so that was under a 12month window Obviously timing will vary boxtobox on what needs to be done The balance of that is baked into our snow pipeline of which we anticipate seeing about 50 to 60 of that flow through the course of 2024The nice part too about the releasing of the Bed Bath boxes is again there have been individual tenants taking the whole boxes which usually compresses the buildout time and the rent commencement date So thats what were already starting to see some flow this yearThe next question comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo Please go aheadThanks Good morning With respect to your push for higher annual escalators are you finding theres any incremental pushback or would you expect to be able to continue to push upward to the neartermYes its market driven obviously you know wed say the Sun Belt markets have been you know areas of opportunity where we can push further north on the increases but its really a casebycase conversation with all the retailers Obviously everythings in negotiation so theres a lot of discussion on the table but we felt we have been confident in our abilities to push it northward and right now it seems to be holding pretty well With the small shop occupancy at 911 obviously matching our alltime high again that supplydemand balance is still working very much in our favorOkay thanksThe next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler Please go aheadHey good morning Thanks for taking my question So sticking with the lack of supply and strong tenant demand I guess thinking about how you guys are having conversations and discussions with your acre tenants So traditionally the acre tenants are able to drive leasing terms on deals But now that the availability is dwindling How is Kimco able to regain leverage in those discussions and maybe curtail some tenantfriendly termsSure Yes I mean outside of the economics youre looking at you know cotenancy provisions exclusive provisions all of which you can start to rebalance loosen up create more flexibility for us Obviously repositioning and redeveloping our centers has been a core principle of ours so having that flexibility to do so I also think we continue to grow into a datadriven market where you have a better sense of the impacts and you see tendencies or understandings change Former principles about the impact of fitness long ago was sort of dispelled by the reality that people go to the gym and then they actually go and shop elsewhere afterwards And so retailers have come to appreciate thatSo I think today more than ever its very much a partnership looking to build the best community for the shopper and the customer And our retailer partnerships are very very strong And theyre willing to explore new opportunities that work for both sidesThe only thing I would add is I think youre seeing retailers become more flexible with store footprint which again opens up a lot more opportunities The days of sort of having their prototype and thats it it seemed to be in the past And so that may not be a lease term specific item but it is an optionality that creates more demand for spaces that might be more tweener sized And thats what youre seeing with some of the Bed Bath opportunitiesThe next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point Please go aheadThanks good morning guys Thanks for taking my question You know Im a little bit surprised that you know in some ways on the reaction from the market on your increasing scale at a time when the fundamentals of the shopping center industry are probably the best weve ever seen But maybe if you could put into context some of the  your historical occupancy and leverage ratios And in particular maybe highlight also maybe if you can talk about what your shop occupancy is at record levels already but are there big regional differences and how much more can you push thatMaybe comparing for example your New York or Long Island shop occupancy versus your national obviously there are market differences here but highlight to the market a little bit on what the upside potential additional upside potential is here in terms of occupancy And also obviously as that snow pipeline comes online what that would do to your already I believe record low leverage ratiosSure Happy to start Floris and we can pass the mic around but youre spoton Were obviously encouraged by the supply and demand dynamic that were experiencing in our portfolio Were using a lot of data analytics to understand that theres virtually no new supply on the horizon and that we feel like our portfolio is well positioned for growth as the signed but not open pipeline continues to build as you saw expand further this quarter which indicates future NOI growthAnd were trying to maintain a portfolio and strategy that allows us to grow regardless of the environment that were facing And so keeping leverage levels at alltime lows for us is important You saw us be proactive and really sort of push out any nearterm maturities with our recent bond offering We continue to think that the small shop occupancy is going to be a bright spot for us as weve just reached alltime highs and were continuing to think theres more to push thereThe demand drivers are multiple and theyre more as I mentioned earlier theres traditional and theres nontraditional And you continue to see the use cases for shopping centers evolve because its all about value and convenience And almost everything you can think of benefits from value and convenience And so thats why the shopping center continues to evolve to be I think the place of choice for whether its a service use whether its a medical use whether its a pure retail use you name it it continues to evolve as the spot where people want to start businessesAnd thats why I think it gives us a lot of encouragement as well as the fact that we have all of this underutilized parking that we think has future outside in the longterm So we always want to think longterm We entitled over 800 units this quarter alone in the portfolio We continue to think that the shopping center will evolve to include multiple uses primarily multifamily for us But we position the portfolio for longterm growth Weve been on a roller coaster of retailAs you know theres been retail apocalypse Theres been the COVID pandemic Theres been all things weve faced in terms of challenges And , , ,0
334,NexGen Energy: Moderately Optimistic Scenario Already Playing Out,I like Uranium and the nuclear industry as an investment I believe its the only way the world can have its cake and eat it too Increase the standard of living while sticking to emissions targets In my first The price of the Uranium remains unchanged or even drops to US30  40lb for several years At a low production cost of less than US 20lb the company was still going to outperform other companies operational mines This would make the investment longterm as the stock price slowly ticks push the price of Uranium Since the price of Uranium stocks is closely correlated to the price of Uranium we start seeing NXE tick higher much before production There is also a possibility that bigger rivals find the valuation attractive enough to make an acquisition offer that would greatly benefit existing shareholdersAn extension of the moderately optimistic case Driven by supply and demand the price of the Uranium can get speculative which may provide a massive boost to underlying Uranium mining stocks Commodity stocks have undergone speculative frenzies before Since NexGen has the largest development stage deposit in the world it may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a speculative environmentPresently we are already seeing the  play out before our eyes and this writeup will serve as an update to our thesisThe stock is up 46 since the original thesis was published towards the end of last year The industry as a whole has been on quite a tear this year What could be remarkable though is the fact that the stock has outperformed both the ETF  that has Uranium miners as holdings and the financial entity dedicated to the acquisition of physical uranium Probably this would come as no surprise if you  that NexGen is in possession of the worlds highestgrade Uranium deposits The region of their deposits Saskatchewan is also recognized as Canadas toprated mining jurisdiction along with an international ranking as the third most attractive mining investment and policy jurisdictionsPresently the company estimates that its Rook I Project is the largest development stage uranium project with the lowest capital intensity compared to peers The large lowcost and lowcapex project mean that the market recognizes how far this company can go when its mines are fully operational and how well the Uranium prices can propel the companyIt is interesting to see how much prices have moved up since our first coverage The spot price was approximately 45lb and is close to 60lb now an increase of 30  35 This is still significantly less than the time we saw Uranium prices in the last bull cycle Spot price  a high of 136 in 2007 and prices have fallen far since then But the market recognizes that if this rally were to sustain as the company ramps into production we could be looking at a cash cow by the end of this decade Earlier still this company could become an attractive prospect for an acquisitionThe company estimates at 75lb average contracting price during last contracting cycle average annual EBITDA during the first five years of annual production would be 25B and at the highest point of 150lb average annual EBITDA would be at 518B This is when our scenario would move from a Moderately optimistic case to a Highly optimistic one It could seem that it is too farfetched to expect this move at this point in time But the setup looks to have a really good foundation Below is a short list of unexpected news that we have seen recently that makes the case for demand shooting up and supply coming up short1 Finland has  regular electricity output at Europes largest nuclear reactor Finlands commitment to nuclear energy alongside hydro and wind power is a crucial component of the countrys journey toward carbon neutrality This strategy has not only supported Finlands resilience to potential energy supply disruptions but also contributed to its environmental goals2 Despite  antinuclear sentiment following the Fukushima disaster Japan is gradually restarting its nuclear reactors Currently onethird of Japans operable reactors have resumed operations and approvals are in progress for an additional 16 reactors with one set to restart this month3 Demand is not only expected to grow through the bulk of new reactors coming mainly from China and India but also by  the operating lifetimes of existing plants Canada France Russia etc are allowing existing plants to operate for up to 60 years and in the USA for 80 years The latest report from WNA has said that demand for uranium in nuclear reactors is expected to climb by 28 by 20304 Utilities  on track to sign contracts for more uranium in 2023 than in any year since 20121 A  in Niger which generates about 4 of the worlds uranium has added to the upward pressure on Uranium prices2 Cameco the second largest Uranium miner announced lower fullyear forecasts for production due to challenges at its Cigar Lake mine and Key Lake mill in Canada The company has said it might buy uranium from the market if needed to help meet obligations to customers3 War in Russia has blocked off critical export routes for the supply mined in Kazakhstan which is the worlds largest supplier of Uranium One of Camecos main sources of outside supply is Kazakhstan and delays have hindered the alternative route for exportsIt has to be stressed that this company is development stage prerevenue and as such the play is on the movement in Uranium prices Any correction or drop in the prices of Uranium would accordingly be reflected or even be magnified in the price of the stockThe fallback or the base case scenario is even if the shortterm to mediumterm thesis fails on the Uranium prices the longterm case for the company becoming one of the biggest Uranium commodity players in the world should still hold But an investor would have to wait until the end of this decade for this to play out fullyFor faster realization of profits it would be prudent to trim the position as we go further into the Uranium price rally Most commodities undergo a period of boom and bust and this time would be no different It seems that we are on the cusp of the boom of another cycle the catalysts for both supply and demand seem to be supported for now This may continue to be supported till we see prices high enough to be able to aid the miners plans to source additional supplyFor now I am holding on to my full investment and may even add to my existing position till I reach my maximum threshold for a single position I will post another update to this thesis when I decide to cut down on my position and take profits   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is

335,Camtek: A Cyclical Play At A Great Price Point,Revenues and margins for Camtek Ltd  have improved immensely over the last few years and 2022 become a very busy year for the company as the top line landed at 321 million CAMT seems to remain on aThese cyclical investments are often associated with trying to timeAs we know CAMT in the semiconductor industry as a developer and manufacturer of inspection and metrology equipment for advanced interconnect packaging and memory and image sensors among other niche segments in the broader semiconductor industry The company has some systems called Eaglei system that primarily focus on delivering 2D inspection and metrology capability for companies in the sectorThe company has experienced strong demand following the surge of semiconductors and the introduction of more advanced AI programs Now almost any company you come across seems to be looking into how to introduce some of the capabilities of the semiconductor industry into their own or how AI could further enhance operational performanceWith a leading position in the market I think that CAMT offers one of the best opportunities to gain strong exposure to the industry without perhaps the same amount of cyclicality and volatility added Many companies in the industry are expected to post a significant YoY decline in 2023 whilst CAMT seems to be holding up rather well That speaks volumes about the type of business you are getting into right here in my opinionLooking at the last from CAMT it seems that they managed to come out ahead of their expectations as revenues landed at 73 million in total As for the coming quarter the projections are that revenues will post a slight quarterly growth and come in at 77  79 million A beat here I think would further solidify the higher valuation that CAMT is receiving right now The ps for example is at 67 right now but as demand rebounds I think that it will be more justified as we know the market is forwardlookingThe CEO Rafi Amit made some comments on the stronger demand the company is experiencing and this is especially reassuring to see as the stronger flow of orders is a good indicator of better times ahead Expectations are also that 2024 will be a record year for the company both in terms of revenues and earnings As for what the market is expecting of CAMT it seems that an EPS of 217 is expected My opinion on the projections heavily relies on demand continuing strongly for the second half of 2023 and CAMT being able to build a strong backlog of orders going into 2024 I think a failure in doing so could perhaps result in earnings coming in just in line with projections but a major beat would send the share price up even higher in my viewThe semiconductor market finds itself amidst a substantial correction cycle driven by a marked decline in demand across a spectrum of devices including PCs smartphones tablets and consumer electronics This pronounced downturn in demand has sent reverberations through the industry prompting a recalibration of strategies and expectations The market has shown itself to be a cyclical one driven by companies wanting to stock up inventory levels and capitalize on coming  That usually means that demand for semiconductors could be a good indicator for customers to companies like CAMT projecting they will have a surge in demandNotably the highend memory has borne the brunt of this correction with prices experiencing a pronounced descent of nearly 50 over the past year This swift and substantial price adjustment reflects the intricate balance between supply and demand dynamics that govern this intricate market These price adjustments are something that needs to be watched by companies like CAMT If the company can display a strong resilience in margins then potentially a higher valuation may be suitable which seems to be the case for CAMT right nowAn equally significant facet of this recalibration revolves around the supply chain intricacies associated with key components particularly for the production of phones personal computers and data center chips The ebbs and flows in demand have led to a renewed equilibrium in lead times within the supply chain marking a return to more conventional and manageable production timelines Since the COVID pandemic however the supply chain issues have eased up significantly and high shipping costs seem to be a thing of the past I dont think this will play out to be a challenge for CAMT in the medium termCAMT has proven itself very capable of growing quickly in the semiconductor industry and building out a broader customer base The company has maintained margins very well and even if 2023 doesnt offer a YoY growth that maybe a lot of investors would have wanted the fact that CAMT is barely posting a decrease when many other companies and peers are doing significantly lower revenues and earnings speaks a lot about what you get with an investment in CAMTI like the price point right now even after the runup it has had and paying a slight premium to the sector is often necessary when you want to get into a company In the long run I believe CAMT will be a winner and I want to be along for the ride Rating CAMT a buy   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or

336,UGL: A Strong Buy Signal In Gold Deserves Some Leverage,Our buy signal in gold last  is still in force The mild price correction over the last 30 days seems to be ending and we expect a strong uptrend to begin In fact it may have already startedWeThe best indicators to forecast gold are not economic or those that forecast physical supply and demand but those based on the buying and selling activity of certain investors plus surveys that measure investor expectations for goldTo begin lets first look at the two indicators that measure buying activity of gold and gold EFTs and the one indicator that measuresThen well look at buying activity in UGL itself which is the gold ETF were recommending to see if it confirms this bullish outlookThis indicator which goes back to 2006 is unique to the Sentiment King Its made by combining the investment activity of two trader types  gold asset managers and gold producers The information comes from the Commitment of Traders dataThe green arrow on the right points to the strong buy signal that occurred last year and its the main reason was remain bullish long term Well probably remain positive on the longterm upward trend of gold until this curve moves into the red zoneOne of the reasons we continue to recommend GLD and now with this article UGL for those aggressive investors who want to use leverage on an expected move in gold is the high puts to calls ratio in GLDOptions traders are notoriously wrong with their investment activity and a high puts to calls ratio is the classic indicator that reflects this The puts to calls ratio is not only useful in determining the direction of the stock market but other investments as wellThe chart above shows the puts to calls ratio for GLD and weve indicated high ratios of the past with dashed arrows You can see the correlationLast month had the highest ratio in the last four and a half years To us this is very bullish for gold and is one major reason we recommend UGL for those aggressive gold investors who want leverageThe third chart is the Sentiment King ranking of the Hulbert gold survey which calculates the ratio of bullish to bearish opinions of gold newsletter writersIts important to notice the black arrow on the right which points to last years green zone price low It occurred when our ranking of bearish sentiment by newsletter writers was also in the green zone which represents a buy signal This was strong additional confirmation of the buy signal from our commitment of trader data shown in the previous chartAs you can see our current ranking of the survey is just above the zero line at 23 Were not worried about a top in gold until both indicators move into their respective red zones and neither is close to that at this time This gives us confidence that higher gold prices lie ahead We recommend buying now and on any dips in price over the next few weeksThe chart below graphs the net asset value of the ProShares 2X gold ETF  UGL This is the leverage gold ETF we recommend It attempts to achieve a return equal to 2X the return of the Bloomberg Gold Subindex The NAV is charted using a semi log scale to show the relative size of the various price movesWe expect a significant move in gold that will push the price of UGL to a minimum price target of 83 or a high target of 98 This is a low end gain of 41 to a high gain of 66 Investor buying activity in UGL shown below supports this overall positive outlookThis chart plots average daily buying in UGL as a percentage of assets The scale is inverted which means low levels of buying at the top of the chart and high levels of buying at the lower endHistory shows that investors in UGL are not good at predicting the direction of gold They buy more UGL when gold is high and ready to decline and less UGL when gold is at a low ready to move higherWeve drawn five arrows that point to low buying levels in UGL Its easy to see that all five occurred at price lows right before higher prices in UGLThe last arrow on the right indicates the current low level of buying This is added confirmation to us that gold prices and the price of UGL are going to move higherAs with all leveraged investments there are added risks and expenses These risks and expenses both limit the returns and make it hard for managers to achieve their investment objectives This is true of UGLIn our opinion the largest expense factor at this time are high short term rates which raise margin costs and increase time premiums on futures and options Because of this we dont believe UGL is a good investment longer than six to nine months As a gold investment it should only be used when indicators favor a strong price increase like we think they do now   Past performance is no guarantee of

337,Taylor Wimpey: Analysis Of The U.K. Housing Market,Our current investment thesis isTaylor Wimpey  is a UKbased residential property developer and homebuilder With a rich history dating back to 1880 theTWs share price has lost value in the decade primarily due to the decline since 2021 with strong distributions offsetting this TWs dividend payments are a reflection of its cashearning potential and business modelPresented above is TWs financial performance in the last decadeTW has achieved healthy revenue growth in the last 10 years with a CAGR of 6 despite the recent decline During this period TW has consistently achieved good growth YoY reflecting the quality of its business modelTWs business model revolves around the acquisition of land planning and development of residential properties The company sells these properties to homebuyers both private and affordable housing TWs revenue is primarily generated through the sale of completed residential unitsFor this reason the identification and acquisition of land for residential development is critical This involves assessing potential sites obtaining planning permissions and managing the legal and regulatory aspects of land acquisition Within the UK there are strict planning rules in place to protect heritage sites areas of nature and other culturally important locations Overarchingly however the dynamics of the UK housing market which we will discuss later means the UK Government is highly encouraging of HomebuildingTW designs and constructs a wide range of homes including apartments townhouses and detached houses This allows the business to reach a broad range of consumers maximizing its selling potential and reducing exposure to any single segmentTW has a longstanding presence in the UK property market which gives it brand recognition and customer trust Based on its size it is only rivaled by a small number of other firms most of whom have a similar reputationTW emphasizes highquality construction and energyefficient features to meet modern living standards The company  although lags behind some of its similarly sized peers There has been an undertone of criticism for UK builders primarily because they have been unable to match the quality of those pre70s A quick google search will have you convinced a property built in 1900 is superior in quality today than a new build and they are likely correct This said new builds are improving following this criticism and offer consumers convenience a smooth buying process a long warranty and are ready to live inThe company operates across various regions in the UK strategically selecting locations with high demand and growth potential for residential properties This approach supports a reduction in exposure to any single region allowing reducing the risk of a decline in demand or inability to sell homes Unlike many of its peers however the business also builds in Spain Tourist hotspots for Brits marginally softening its reliance on the UKThe company aims to secure a significant portion of its sales before construction is completed which provides more predictable revenue streams and reduces financial risks For this reason the business is somewhat hedged against downturns as its costs are already covered by past earningsThe UK similar to most of the Western world has seen a rapid increase in inflation during 20212022 followed by a steady increase in interest rates to combat this While the US has brought inflation down to below 5 the UK and much of Europe have been less successful primarily due to a greater reliance on importing Energy and FoodOur expectation is for the current trend to continue with inflation slowly declining MoM but requiring further rate hikes to ensure this decline is sustainable We are now expecting rates to peak at 556 in 2024 before beginning a decline quicker decline from thereThe impact on the housing market is substantial and we are already seeing the effects UK house prices have declined at the Tighter lending conditions during periods of high interest rates will limit the availability of mortgages for potential buyers Further high inflation and interest rates are reducing consumers purchasing power making it more challenging for potential homebuyers to be in a position to afford an acquisitionThis is a major issue for TW with projects currently under construction facing a softening of demand This will encourage greater negotiation by those seeking to purchase forcing TW to accept a reduced amountAs the following illustrates UK housing affordability has declined over time increase in affordability ratio with a significant bump during the GFC and likely another which we are currently experiencing This will act to price more consumers out of the housing market and into the rental industryThis begs the question of what the wider impact will be in the coming years Consumers are facing an unprecedented deterioration of their finances with no clear route to reprieve Many individuals will see a permanent decline in financial standing essentially pricing them out of a new build purchase and setting them back years UK Consumer Confidence illustrates this currently at pandemic low levelsDuring times of high inflation the costs of raw materials labor and other inputs for construction can increase significantly TW faces challenges in managing rising construction costs in the medium term likely impacting profit margins unless the increased costs can be passed on to buyers through higher property prices This is usually what occurs during periods of inflation however the degree to which consumers are struggling means prices are unlikely to offset thisThe UK housing industry is unique in that it has performed modesty well for centuries Most recently the industry bounced back well from the GFC especially impressive given the rapid rise it experienced fueled by foreign money Countries like Italy and Spain are still struggling with house prices over a decade laterThis inherent strength in the housing market is a reflection of two key factors Firstly and most simply the UK is an incredibly attractive place to invest Foreigners have been buying up properties businesses and anything they can get their hands on with the promise of healthy returns and economiclegal safety With Brexit this has certainly softened but remains the caseSecondly the UK has a demand and supply imbalance The UK is smaller than New Zealand in size km2 while having a population of over 67 million NZ has 5m This naturally means the demand for housing is high exacerbated by an aspirational culture of home ownershipGiven these two factors we believe the housing industry is inherently safe The current conditions are highly concerning and will likely take an extended period to correct This said we are not bearish on the UK housing industry as the fundamentals are not going awayTW faces competition from other UKbased residential property developers which are listed later in this report This somewhat restricts the earnings potential of the cohort as they compete for land and development opportunitiesTWS margins have been incredibly consistent over the historical period and impressively so in the LTM owing to the factor mentioned previously TW will only invest in locations that are neutral or accretive for the wider business and competition means it is unlikely to materially outperform this and thus see margin appreciation over timeThere is scope for technological development making the build process significantly quicker and cheaper but it remains unclear when this will be possible at a mass market levelWe expect margins to contract in the near term as inflationary cost pressures and a lack of demand force the business to conceding in negotiationsThe key takeaways from the H1 results areThese results are in line with our expectations We forecast the business to end the year down 2027 owing to the likelihood of a larger decline in H2 following further rate hikes in the UKTWs balance sheet remains robust with a NDEBITDA ratio of 08x and a sufficiently large cash position to fund operations in the coming year assuming no salesPresented above is Wall Streets consensus view on the coming 5 yearsAnalysts are forecasting a 24 decline in FY23 followed by a 10 growth rate into FY27F Margins are expected to materially decline with a permanently lower level subsequentlyWe broadly agree with these forecasts although we believe MSD growth into FY27 is more reasonablePresented above is a comparison of TW to a cohort of its directly comparable peers namely Persimmon  Barratt Developments  Bellway  Vistry  Berkeley  and Redrow Margins are relatively standardized across the peer group with no material difference between the group The movement in FCF is volatile reflecting differing approaches to current conditions TW has continued to invest in inventoryForecast growth suggests a strong weakness with TW owing to its significant scale and core demographic Declining earnings is the biggest obstacle currently and TW is overly exposedTW is currently trading at 5x LTM EBITDA and 7x NTM EBITDAOn an LTM basis TW looks incredibly attractive The stock is trading at a discount while being positioned well relative to the group and has a good portfolio of landThis view changes on a NTM basis Given the decline the company is facing the risk is that it quickly becomes overvalued At a 4 discount to its peer group but more importantly facing a large decline in sales with an uncertain impact on margins it is difficult to suggest there is upside at the current share priceThe UK housing market is a modest investment choice in our view particularly over an extended period of time TW among a cohort of a few leading developers provides investors the ability to gain exposure to this industryWe expect a difficult period in the coming 1218 months and TW is highly exposed We see sales declining further and margins tighteningThe performance beyond this should be good however to invest today feels prematureEditors Note This article

338,Generac: 5 Key Takeaways From Analyst Day,held its  conference on September 27th and shares rose 5 on the affirmation of 2023 guidance and longterm targets that were higher than initially estimated and appear reasonable as inventories normalize and supplyManagement remains confident in longterm secular megatrends accelerating the value homeowners place on energy security GNRC continues growing its portfolio of backup power and home energy control productsGenerac presents a compelling investment proposition against the backdrop of a global shift towards energy resilience and selfsufficiency The escalating adoption of solar plus storage solutions and the heightened interest in backup power especially amidst a spate of weatherinduced disruptions and grid instabilities align well with the companys strategic direction Generacs robust distribution network and strong brand recognition further solidify its potential for sustained growth and value addition in the coming yearsDuring the conference management reiterated its FY 2023 guidance and expects revenue of 402B to 411B and adjusted EBITDA margins of 155 to 165 translating to an EBITDA of 623M to 678M The Commercial  Industrial CI segment is expected to grow in the midteens while the residential segment is expected to decline in the midtwentiesThis past year has posed significant challenges for GNRC as the imbalance between supply and demand drew investors apprehension The concerns largely stemmed from supplyside bottlenecks exacerbated by climateinduced severe weather inadequate infrastructure investments and regulatory penalties for carbon emissions Meanwhile the demand for Generacs solutions remains fueled by broader electrification trends nextgeneration infrastructure initiatives and the growing concept of home as a sanctuaryManagement reasserting 2023 guidance is a subtle positive alleviating investor fears over potential guidance downgrades Amidst a backdrop of supplyside obstacles this reiteration underscores Generacs strategic positioning to leverage the ongoing demand drivers shedding a promising light on its ability to navigate the current market adversities As Generac continues to adapt to the evolving market dynamics its investment narrative encompasses a blend of challenges and opportunities lying aheadGNRC expects to grow total revenues by 12 to 14 annually through 2026 and targets margins returning to its longterm average of 375 to 385 gross margin and 215 to 225 EBITDA margins in 2026 relative to 34 to 345 and 155 to 165 in 2023 guidance The implied FY26 EBITDA doubling over FY23 guidance is predominately attributed to improving product mix operating leverage positive price dynamics and less dilution from the energy technology segmentWhile GNRC looks for growth to tilt towards 20252026 expectations of a weaker consumer in 2024 are offset through 300mm of channel undershipment during 2023 which should benefit residential growth regardless of enddemand next yearHowever amidst the positive outlook across various segments a pivotal assumption underpinning the 2026 targets is the increase in the energy technology mix to 21 from 12 in FY23 This ambitious stride may cause investor skepticism once more clarity is achieved regarding the recent execution challenges within that business segmentThe current market penetration of 6 in residential Home Standby HSB underscores a significant growth opportunity GNRC estimates the penetration will reach 78 by 2026 with each additional percentage point of penetration equating to a 3bn endmarket revenue opportunity This represents a unique opportunity to drive growth in a category with secular tailwinds by harnessing the power of fullfunnel marketing and distribution developmentInhome consultations are up four times from 2019 levels close rates have rebounded off 1Q22 lows and awareness data pointing to record Generac brand recognition underpins managements confidence in mediumterm doubledigit HSB growthA notable demographic insight is that 65 of Generacs existing customer base comprises individuals over 60 This demographic implies a significant underrepresentation among new home buyers in millennials It also indicates a potential growth tailwind as a new energyconscious generation transitions into homeownershipGNRCs energy technology segment has yet to meet external and internal expectations The segment has refocused on a quality first product portfolio rebuild Over the past year management has focused on building a capable team adding engineers and increasing product testing standards to avoid product underperformance before being soldWhile 2024 targets include executing 2023s groundwork a return to strong growth and profitability is not expected until 2025 and 2026 Investor sentiment toward this business must be tampered and understand that 2023 is a reset year with a meaningful stepup in 2024The longterm outlook for this segment remains encouraging with Generac aiming for a revenue of 700 million next year and breakeven profitability by 2026 The enhanced product slate encompasses residential offerings like an EV charger solar inverter and a nextgen storage systemhome energy controller Meanwhile the CI segment focuses on stationary and mobile storage beyond standby generators connectivity and grid servicesThe CI segment continues to experience secular tailwinds prompting GNRC to build a 4th US facility in Beaver Dam WI with completion expected in early 2025 Within the US CI customers seek more complex fullservice solutions to support gridservices opportunities pushing demand for GNRCs beyond standby offeringsTelecommunications providers and data center operators emerge as pivotal customers underpinning growth plans given their extensive capacity buildouts through the end of the decade and high energy reliability standardsThe international outlook within the CI segment remains strong as accelerating Electric Vehicle EV penetration and a growing renewables mix forcing grid intermittency challenges and grid services incentives all buoy demand expectations Notably the CI segment constituted nearly 75 of GNRCs international product mix in 2022 attesting to its global significanceGNRC is currently trading at the lower end of its 52week range offering a potentially attractive valuation relative to its 20242025 earnings The upbeat sentiment following investor day adds an appeal of a return to normalcy However a hold is recommended until tangible improvements in operational and financial efficiencies manifest affirming the ambitious goal of doubling EBITDA by 2026 is more than just a lofty projection The trajectory of the Residential CI and Energy Technology segments both in the US and internationally will be instrumental in translating Generacs strategic blueprints into tangible financial milestones warranting close investor scrutiny   Past performance is no

340,PubMatic: Small Company In A Highly Competitive Market,PubMatic  is a company that went public in 2020 capitalizing on the strong appetite for risk in the market at the time However since its IPO the share price has declined by 50 primarily due to the overvaluation atDespite operating in a market poised for  in the coming years and achieving solid returns with Net Income margins of 12 I believe the company faces a challenging task in maintaining or gaining market share This is especially true given that some of its key competitors include industry giants like Google Amazon and MetaIn this article we will delve into the composition of the digital advertising ecosystem provide a valuation of PubMatic and outlinePubMatic is a company that operates in the digital advertising technology industry It provides a platform that enables publishers to automate and optimize the management of their digital advertising inventory This includes tools for programmatic advertising realtime bidding and other solutions to help publishers maximize their advertising revenueAt the heart of Digital Marketing are  which serve as the bridge between supply and demand acting as the meeting point for  and  For instance when brands like CocaCola or Nike the Advertisers want to conduct digital advertising  that is to occupy digital spaces with images and videos of their products  they must purchase ad space from Publishers In our example this Publisher would be a digital newspaper like The Wall Street Journal These ad spaces in the newspapers are obtained through the aforementioned Ad Exchanges However its important to note that Ad Exchanges dont directly sell ad spaces to Advertisers rather they auction them As a result if Advertisers want to secure ad placements in these newspapers they must compete with each other to place the highest bidThese  charge a commission for each closed exchange operation and some examples include Googles AdX OpenX and Xandr Essentially this is the technology where the auction and sale of impressions also known as inventory take place This inventory can come in various formats including display video ads in apps like Facebook and Instagram and other types of digital advertising that we are all familiar withThe ad spaces offered by the  contain valuable information for the  such as the type of device where they will appear the time of day the location of the ad the geographical location of the user website information and more Now while Advertisers could manually evaluate each auction one by one as you can imagine this would be very laborintensive and resourceintensive This is why there are tools called s DemandSide Platforms that automate the process of evaluating the conditions proposed by the Publishers They use algorithms to search and aggregate rates from different networks into a single platform and determine the optimal price to offer in the auction Some wellknown DSPs include The Trade Desk Meta DSP or Amazon DSPJust as Advertisers use DSPs to evaluate multiple rates offered in Ad Exchanges like Google Ads and OpenX Publishers like The Wall Street Journal have tools called s SupplySide Platforms to connect with multiple Ad Exchanges instead of offering their inventory on just one platform This strategy allows them to generate greater competition for their ad space potentially leading to higher selling prices SSPs help Publishers manage and optimize their ad inventory by providing tools to control and analyze the performance of their digital advertising And  However its worth noting that there are enormous competitors in this space such as Google Amazon and even Verizon as can be seen in this  of SSPs used by US publishersThis complicates the task of gaining market share given that Google and Amazon have almost complete vertical integration within the ecosystem They function as DSPs SSPs Ad Exchanges and even Publishers when digital ads are intended for platforms like Google Search or Amazon Consequently it may be more straightforward for clients to collaborate with these industry giants renowned for their excellent reputation rather than taking the risk of trying PubMatics servicesIn the last 5 years the companys revenues have experienced extraordinary annual growth of 28 while maintaining high profitability with the FCF margin averaging around 15 However in FY2022 it reached 20One positive aspect contributing to the companys cost control is its ownership of its own servers Several years ago the management team recognized that to become a serious player in the industry they should build their own servers rather than opting for the traditional approach taken by many technology companies which is to outsource to Amazon AWS This strategic decision has allowed them to maintain a relatively stable cost base and has been a key driver of operating leverageIn addition the company has consistently maintained returns on its capital employed at around 15 This suggests that a significant portion of profits can be reinvested into the company as each investment generates a more than satisfactory return The fact that the company is achieving substantial returns on its investments is particularly significant given that it is allocating a significant amount of CapEx to the continued construction of its own data centers as we will explore laterSince 2020 at least 10 of revenues has been allocated to CapEx as mentioned earlier This investment is primarily directed toward constructing their own data centers and gaining better control over their costs As the company continues to scale and establish more data centers it is likely that this CapEx spending will decrease potentially impacting the Free Cash Flow Margin as it expandsSomething I consider negative is that PubMatic faces the typical silent killer of technology companies StockBased Compensation SBC In recent years SBC has accounted for more than 20 of Free Cash Flow This is a substantial amount and I would prefer to deduct it from Free Cash Flow since it doesnt represent an actual cash inflow SBC primarily serves as a means to attract talent without the need for cash paymentsIf PubMatic were to cease issuing shares as part of employee compensation it could result in either the loss of employees or the necessity to pay them with cash Neither of these scenarios seems positive so its common for SBC levels to be maintained in the medium and long term By subtracting SBC from Free Cash Flow the margin would be around 12 which is quite a distance from the 20 seen in FY2022For the valuation I will perform a Reverse DCF analysis to determine the implied growth rate in the current share price based on FY2022 data Here are the relevant figuresUsing this data and the stated assumptions achieving a 15 compound annual growth rate on the current share price would require Free Cash Flow to grow by 15 annually This growth rate appears quite realistic and could be realized through a combination of revenue growth and an expansion in the FCF margin as discussed in the Key Ratios section  The digital advertising technology space is highly competitive featuring numerous established players and startups As weve observed Google Amazon and Meta are dominant figures across a significant portion of the ecosystem Consequently this intense competition can result in pricing pressures and diminished profit margins Furthermore the industry has been witnessing a trend toward consolidation with larger companies acquiring smaller ones PubMatic may face the risk of being acquired by a larger competitor or ceding market share to companies with greater resources Rapid advancements in technology including changes in ad formats tracking regulations such as GDPR and CCPA and shifts in consumer behavior like the use of adblockers can impact PubMatics ability to provide effective advertising solutions For instance the Apple IDFA and Cookies issue emerged unexpectedly and temporarily disrupted the digital advertising industry This is a highly dynamic industry that as history has shown with traditional advertising can render businesses obsolete in a matter of just a few years Economic downturns can result in reduced advertising budgets directly impacting PubMatics revenues as advertisers scale back their spending In fact we have already observed this trend over the last few quarters with YoY growth slowing to less than 1 since Q4 2022While PubMatics role within the digital advertising ecosystem appears attractive I find it challenging for PubMatic to emerge as the winning horse when competing against giants like Google and Amazon The fact that it ranked as the fourth most used SSP in 2021 is a positive sign Additionally the digital advertising market is expected to grow by around 13 in the coming years which should provide tailwinds for the company However I remain uncertain about how PubMatic will sustain relevance in an industry where differentiation relies on easily replicable technology especially when it is not even the largest competitorTherefore despite the current valuation not being unfavorable I have chosen to assign it a  rating I believe that there are better options available in the current market some of which may be equally or even more affordable particularly outside of the United States   Past

341,Nike: Leading The Athletic Market With A Resilient DTC Strategy,NIKE Inc  is the global leader in the athletic market boasting diversification across product categories geographical regions and distribution channels The company stands out with a compelling directtoconsumer DTC strategy in the branded industry A key aspect of this strategy is aNKEs  for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024To rebalance supply and demand NKE is carefully managing sales into the retail channel and restricting inventory access to ensure a healthy marketplace Notably endchannel sales remain above NKEs expectations for a slightly increased revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 Regarding the directtoconsumer market in North America the liquidation activity from the previous year especially in the apparel segment is now being compared resulting in a net positive impact on merchandise margins Sales growth however is under pressure as lowerquality transactions are avoided While debates around the bull and bear case may persist until there is greater clarity on wholesale recovery and macroeconomic conditions Nike continues to maintain a dominant position as a footwear brand both in North America and globally and its inventory has been adjusted to align with fastergrowing sales while the wholesale destocking is expected to conclude by the end of the yearIn the upcoming second quarter Nike foresees a slight increase in reported revenues The company projects a gross profit margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points due to strategic pricing better handling of markdowns and reduced ocean freight costs However this gain will be partially offset by higher product input costs and around 50 basis points of adverse foreign exchange effects The management also expects selling general and administrative expenses to rise in the midtohigh single digitsLooking at the full year Nike has reiterated its outlook anticipating revenues to increase in the midsingle digits The management projects a gross profit margin increase of 140160 basis points which includes roughly 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations SGA expenses are expected to slightly outpace revenues particularly at the upper end of the midsingledigit range Its worth noting that the company anticipates only a modest improvement in markdowns for the rest of the year suggesting there may be room for betterthanexpected performance in this areaWith 15 of its sales coming from China Nike is in a good position to benefit from a rollback in COVID19 restrictions in the region The reopening may help growth continue to accelerate into 2024 The sales in China appear poised to keep surging as the country benefits from consumers returning to normal activities going outside and playing sports again Currencyneutral revenue in China jumped 25 in fiscal 4Q ended May 31 but could accelerate significantly in the near term as demand ramps up and Nike launches hyperlocal products such as its Chinese New Year and Year of the Rabbit packs Faster revenue growth may also benefit overall margins in my view since China typically boasts the highest profitability while inventories are relatively manageable Nike has the  footwear market share in China and is No 2 in apparel In 4Q 15 of Nike Brand sales came from ChinaMoreover the contribution of Chinas sports industry to GDP could rise this year as more residents resume outdoor activities after the end of Beijings Covid Zero policy This would come after the contribution to GDP dipped to  in 2020 from 2019s 114 and remained at 107 in 2021 Covid disrupted many sportsrelated businesses and activities which resulted in an 8 fall in the manufacturing of athletic goods Widespread virus outbreaks across mainland China likely also limited the rise in purchases of sporting goods last year This might have offset sportsrelated sales gains driven by the Beijing Winter OlympicsI believe Nikes dominance in sports can continue to foster brand success given its sponsorship of some highestranked teams and players at key sporting events During NCAA basketballs March Madness this year Nike and its Jordan label sponsored 40 out of 68  The brand also outfitted 13 of the 32 teams in the 2022 Mens World Cup soccer tournament with two of them making it to the final four Nike also has 13 of the 32 teams in the 2023 Womens World Cup with seven of those ranked in the top 10 continuing to keep the brand in the spotlight Nike also sponsors tennis players Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus ranked No 2 in womens and No1 ranked mens player Carlos Alcaraz of Spain which helps the brands status for key tennis events like the justcompleted Wimbledon and the upcoming US OpenNike is actively working to reduce its inventories which may lead to continued margin pressure due to increased discounts Nike has already managed to bring down its previously high inventory levels with growth remaining flat at the end of fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year Nike has integrated personalized product recommendations into its ecommerce app to boost the sellthrough of available inventory Nike is trading at 26x forward PE which is in line with the companys historical threeyear average but represents a premium compared to global peers which typically have lower PE ratios ranging from low doubledigits to midteens The premium reflects the highquality nature of Nikes business its leading position in the appealing athletic category marginenhancing strategies despite recent margin challenges and a robust balance sheet I believe that Nike continues to be a toptier company with strong market positioning in both apparel and footwear further bolstered by its strong digital capabilities Moreover Nikes deep connection with customers sets it apart from competitors especially as consumers increasingly prefer brands that offer a unique experience in both physical stores and online Hence I remain bullish on the stock and assign a buy rating to the companyI see the biggest risk to a NKE recovery to be the weakening macro backdrop and potential for recession Even in such a backdrop I continue to see NKE as a relative brand and market share winner While NKE would not be immune to a weaker demand backdrop I believe a strong balance sheet highly sought after products driving brand equity and companyspecific operational initiatives could still drive margin expansion from current levels Moreover competition has risen due to the industrys shift toward performanceoriented products which has lowered barriers for new entrants which may threaten the companys market shareNike Inc is an established player in the global athletic market and is wellpositioned for growth The reopening in China is expected to drive continued sales growth as consumers return to normal activities engage in outdoor sports and drive demand for Nike products Additionally Nikes sponsorship of top teams and players in key sporting events further enhances its brands success and visibility in the sports world The companys directtoconsumer strategy in the branded industry is particularly impressive This strategy places a strong emphasis on the DTC channel primarily through Nike Direct and strategic partnerships with marketplaces The loyal customer base acquired during the pandemic is expected to make a positive impact on the companys profitability Hence I am bullish on the company and assign a buy rating to the stock   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is

342,BlackRock Is The Next Compounder You Should Own,In the vast universe of equity markets theres a unique type of stock that stands above all the others Compounders These rare entities are characterized by their ability to consistently compound returns at higherthanaverage rates providing investors with attractive longterm appreciationOne such opportunity presenting itself right now is BlackRock  This powerhouse has demonstrated the resilience and growth characteristics that all compounders share backed by impressive supply and demand dynamics for its sharesToday well take a look at what makes a compounder in our view why BlackRock fits squarely into this category of companies and why now is a great time to get involved in the stockSo what exactly defines a compounder As we just alluded to compounders are companies that have unique characteristics that make them potentially great longterm investmentsIn our view at its core a compounder is a company that consistently increases its revenue and free cash flow while simultaneously reducing its share count This potent combination creates a wealthbuilding engine for investorsRemember for capital appreciation to occur buyers and sellers in the market to agree that an assets value has increased vs the year before  this doesnt happen automaticallyInstead demand for shares needs to be stimulated and the supply of shares needs to be shrinkingWhat drives demand for shares More profits and an increasing scope of the businessWhat drives shrinking supply Companies buying back sharesTake UnitedHealth Group  for instance Over the past decade UnitedHealth has displayed the quintessential traits of a compounderIts TTM revenue has consistently grown from 147 billion in 2015 to an astounding 348 billion in 2023 a testament to its strong market position and business strategy In parallel its free cash flow has increased from 8 billion to nearly 38 billion during the same periodMeanwhile UNHs outstanding share count has steadily decreased due to its share buyback program from 991 million shares in 2015 to around 940 million in 2023 This isnt as aggressive as some other buyback programs but share count has still dropped by 5 in that time nonethelessAs a result the company has seen a dramatic increase in share price with a total return over that time of nearly 400Companies with the inverse characteristics no demand growth and an increasing supply struggle to hold onto gains Verizon  a company like this has seen essentially zero total returns over the same period of timeShifting our lens to BlackRock the compounder qualities are readily apparent Over the past seven years BlackRocks TTM revenue has steadily grown from 114 billion to an impressive 18 billion reflecting a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 7Simultaneously its TTM net income has soared from 31 billion to 51 billion reflecting a compound growth rate of more than 7Its true that net income is been a bit lumpier due to a transaction in 2018 but remove that and the overall trend is unmistakableThis is doubly as impressive given the ability for the company to keep its net margins stable around 29 again remove the transaction in 2018That said the magic of compounders lies not only in expanding financial results and an increasing demand for shares but also in a shrinking share countDuring the same period as discussed above BlackRock has diligently bought back shares reducing the outstanding count from 168 million to 150 millionWhile this reduction only adds up to a 10 decrease in outstanding shares this action coupled with strong financial growth enhances the value of remaining shares thus benefiting longterm investorsPlus the consistency of the reduction in supply is hearteningAll of this seems well and good but with a clear understanding of Company Xs compounder characteristics the question arises Why nowIn short because the current valuation presents an attractive looking entry point and management is forecasting continued growthAt the moment the stock currently trades at a 27x multiple of free cash flow a bit lower than its fiveyear average of 30x Similarly its pricetorevenue ratio sits at an attractive 57x compared to its historical range as pictured belowWhile some may view these multiples as elevated for a financial company as Seeking Alphas Quant Rating System does we believe that a better comparison would be a company like Visa  Visa has similarly stellar operations and trades within a similar rangeAdditionally buyers at this point are getting the stock below the 5year linear regression within the lower band of standard deviation Sure buying BlackRock at 20x FCF would be ideal but the opportunity may not present itselfIn addition to the decent price results have also begun to swing back around in favor of the bullsWhile the company has done well in almost all market environments late 2021 into 2022 was a rough spot for the company Revenue was reduced somewhat and net income dropped for the first time organically in a long timeThankfully results are beginning to turn around and management has begun to strike a more bullish tone On the most recent earnings call CFO Martin Small had the following to sayCEO Larry fink continuedThis growth in assets looks like its translating to a bottom in financial results and potentially a bottom in the stock priceIts hard to pick out many risks for BlackRock given the scale of its offerings and the ingrained nature of its business into the world economyThere are two potential ways we think the narrative around BlackRock could change meaningfullyFirst if burdensome financial regulations come out that constrain BlackRock in some way that could negatively impact the stock We see an incredibly powerful moat around BlackRocks business and thus one of the only entities capable of piercing it would be the US Federal GovernmentAdditionally the company is making a big bet on its Aladdin software Aladdin runs a considerable amount of the companys processes and a cyberattack could present a serious risk to BlackRock and its reputation going forward If clients begin to perceive weakness in security of info or funds we expect the stock will behave poorlyOverall though BlackRock is a company with an incredibly small number of risk vectorsIn conclusion the investment thesis for BlackRock is compelling and straightforwardAs a proven compounder it has consistently demonstrated robust financial growth and efficient capital allocation Its track record of increasing revenue and net income coupled with a consistently decreasing share count underscores its commitment to delivering shareholder valueDespite the recent bumps BlackRocks strong fundamentals remain intactNow more than ever represents an opportune moment for savvy investors to tap into this undervalued gem poised to continue along its trajectory   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any

343,"Klabin: Q3 Earnings, Resilience In The Face Of Industry Challenges",The Brazilian pulp and paper giant Klabin  recently published its thirdquarter results Although these results were not outstanding they indicate a positive sequential improvementAs I  in my initial article about the company Klabin has recentlyDespite reporting a weak net profit Klabins third quarter showed promising results in its paper unit with a recovery in packaging sales Moreover there are expectations of improved pulp prices in the future although this business division had a weak performance in the current quarterThe lack of more significant revenue growth for Klabin should not necessarilyTherefore I believe that despite not reporting an outstanding quarter Klabin has maintained stable numbers without a significant decline which is a positive outcome Furthermore the company remains wellpositioned to continue distributing substantial dividends over the coming yearsKlabin  its thirdquarter figures reporting an EBITDA of R1352 billion This represents a modest quarterly increase of 06 but a yearoveryear decline of 41 Adverse exchange rate variations impacted the financial results as the reduction in biological assets resulted in a net profit of R258 million marking a quarterly drop of 734 and an annual drop of 874On the other hand the companys revenues showed marginal growth reported at R44 billion a 25 increase quarteroverquarter although still 198 below the same period last yearThe positive surprise came from the pulp business where increased volumes up 274 compared to the previous quarter and lower costs down 36 compared to the last quarter were observedAn additional significant point to note is the increase in net debt which rose to R209 billion compared to R195 billion in the second quarter of 2023 This led to a higher leverage ratio of 32 times the net debtEBITDA compared to 26 times in the second quarter of 2023 This represents a reversal of the companys recent deleveraging efforts following the completion of the Puma II project However its worth noting that the Puma II project is expected to enhance the companys profitability over the next few yearsKlabins consolidated return measured by the return on invested capital ROIC metric was 138 in June 2023 marking a 55 percentage point decline compared to last year Klabin attributes this retraction to the reduced operating cash flow and the capital increase employedBreaking down the companys results by segment here are the following key highlightsPulp volumes saw a strong performance with a reported volume of 425k Sales of Short Fiber reached 315kt marking a 290 increase quarteronquarter and a 66 rise yearonyear Long Fiber  Fluff also reached 111kt recording a further 23 increase quarteronquarter but a slight 42 decline yearonyearAccording to the company the increase in volume was mainly attributed to improved demand in Asia and greater efficiency at the Puma I unit following scheduled maintenance stoppagesDespite the weak dynamics in Kraftliner the thirdquarter volume reached 102kt reflecting a 44 increase in the quarter but a substantial 277 yearonyear decline This suggests a shortterm sequential improvement primarily driven by the rampup of MP28 MP28 is commencing containerboard production with plans for a small conversion of cardboard boxes soonHowever in the face of a more challenging international environment the price situation for Kraftliner is expected to remain relatively weak The increase in US exports disrupts the international supply and demand balance resulting in realized product prices of R3400t This represents a quarteroverquarter decrease of 148 and a yearonyear decline of 352Paperboard experienced a lower volume primarily due to the 11day scheduled maintenance stoppage at Monte Alegre However this decline was partially offset by the commencement of the MP28 rampup resulting in a sales volume of 165kt This reflects a modest drop of 25 in the quarter and a decrease of 92 over the yearCorrugated boards on the other hand entered a more favorable seasonal period but still faced challenges in passing on price increases There was an uptick in volume in the years second half in preparation for the holiday season Corrugated sales reached 226kt marking a 46 quarterly increase Given the frequent corrections in prices due to inflation and Brazilian GDP growth corrugated paper prices retracted to R5850t This represents a 11 decrease quarteronquarter and a 18 increase yearoveryearI remain skeptical that the third quarter marked a turning point for Klabin indicating a return to significant operational growthWhile the overall results in 3Q23 were not as dire as they could have been I anticipate that Q4 could still present challenges particularly for the paper and packaging division However there are prospects for improvement in the pulp segment Additionally higher pulp prices in China offset ongoing cost inflation and the marginal recovery of pulp and kraftliner prices in Europe Hence the potential for a fullscale recovery seems limited due to the persistent oversupply resulting from recent capacity expansions in pulp kraftliner and paperboardAlthough pulp prices have  some recent recovery with two price increases implemented for the Chinese market the current price level is likely unsustainable I do not foresee a sustained upward trend in the commoditys price Its worth noting that if selling prices increase the company can maintain or even enhance its profit margins benefiting shareholdersKlabin has announced the approval of the distribution of interest on shareholders equity JCP in the total amount of R319 million to shareholders equivalent to 011 per shareThis practice specific to the Brazilian tax system and corporate finance involves companies paying interest to their shareholders on the equity invested in the company It has distinct tax implications in Brazil Unlike dividends JCP is accounted for as an expense for companies reducing taxable net incomeConsidering that one analyst estimates Klabins EPS for 2023 at 166 this represents a 56 increase To achieve this the company must report a net profit of 13164 million in 2023 which I believe is still feasible Therefore considering Klabins expected payout for 2023 of 541 this would result in a dividend per share of 013 Since the company pays quarterly dividends Klabins dividend yield would be approximately 58 with an annual payout of 052Assuming a more conservative return on investment ROI of 5 with Klabins current share price at 890 this would indicate a fair value of 1360 representing an upside of 528 in my assessment This is close to the levels seen in 2021 and early 2022 during a solid upside in the kraft pulp cycleWhile some investors may find Klabins quarter uneventful and lacking revenue and profit growth surprises I view it differently Given the persistently challenging sector conditions characterized by low pulp prices the results were not disappointing and can be considered positiveThe key highlights include the paper and packaging volume growth despite scheduled paperboard maintenance Additionally the substantial volume of pulp sales is noteworthy driven by operational improvements following the stoppage at Puma I in the previous quarterHowever there are less favorable aspects to consider Kraftliner continues to face pricing challenges due to international factors EBITDA did not exhibit significant quarterly growth with paper sales declining while pulp sales increased Furthermore the bottom line was weak partly due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations impacting the financial resultNevertheless the company is expected to continue distributing substantial dividends in the upcoming quarters and we will likely see a yield of between 5 and 6 Considering the current valuation is heavily discounted I reaffirm my bullish outlook on Klabin following the Q3

344,TC Energy: Growth Business Strategy And Attractive 7.5% Dividend Yield Make Stock Appealing,TC Energy  is a prominent energy infrastructure company operating in the United States Canada and Mexico TC Energys main financial drivers are related to its extensive infrastructure assets and commercial agreements The company has comprehensive operations in natural gas andAfter the downturn of 2020 and other supply constraints like the Russian invasion of Ukraine everyone realized that all forms of energy are required to make countries capable of meeting energy demand As I explained in my previous  TC Energys separated assets and infrastructures in a wide range of energy platforms make it prominent In minutiae the company has facilities for transporting natural gas fromIt is worth noting that an unforeseen incident in the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline caused the management to drop their operations at reduced pressure in late July The cause of the failure is currently unknown but based on initial observations of the failed pipe environmental cracking is the suspected cause Based on the  report Although the company returned to service the adjacent parts of the pipeline system that were not impacted by the incident directly we may see this impact on the companys thirdquarter operation results The reduced pressure at the Columbia Gas Transmission caused TRP stock price to drop by 13 however it is not a concern as the infrastructure and operations will be fixed soonAs you may all know after global events last year and the energy constraints the management  to separate into two businesses to keep the strength of each balance sheet and take advantage of tax incentives for higher growth opportunities Through this spinoff TC Energy moved toward a more regulated business model related to renewables For instance approximately 75 of TRPs comparable EBITDA will be from nuclear and firming resources by the end of 2030 which are highly regulatedThe spinoff brings the opportunity for the company to generate circa 96 of its adjusted EBITDA from regulated rates and longterm contracts which will diminish its risk of reliance on commodity prices to a great extent As a result the management expects to grow their 2022 comparable EBITDA at a 7 comparable annual growth rate by the end of 2026 On the other hand the management plans to sustain their capital spending at a minimum range and thus expects ample free cash flow in the coming years With the mentioned free cash flow their shareholder returns and leverage conditions are expected to improveAs Figure 1 demonstrates TRPs operating cash flow increased by 17 to approximately 55 billion in TTM versus 47 billion at the end of 2022 Although the high amount of capital expenditures of 55 billion in TTM led to 476 million of free cash outflow the company is expected to generate more cash flow from operations due to their spinoff thereby generating higher free cash flow in the future In the second quarter of 2023 TC Energy paid CAD096 dividend cash which based on their 1029000000 outstanding shares accounts for CAD9878 million or approximately 128 billion of dividend payment The companys cash from operation was enough to cover their dividend payment It is worth noting that capital spending usually is paid by debt and equity financing in the companies in this industryFigure 1  TRPs cash structure in millionsTC Energy provides a 745 dividend yield which is an attractive element of the company Also as Figure 2 illustrates their yield has been on a growing path during the last ten years In addition as the management asserted their liquids business expects to grow its dividend by 23 yearly by 2026 Furthermore TRPs PE ratio of 49x shows a considerable plunge yeartodate which is another sign that the stock is cheap now and is likely to recover As a result currently TC Energys financials offer both capital appreciation and increasing dividend yield while the stock is lower than its historical recordsFigure 2Analyzing the companys capital structure indicates that TC Energy could improve its cash balance to the same level as before the 2020 outbreak and reach more than 12 billion of cash generation in TTM In addition their net debt level increased to over 45 billion in TTM which shows the companys higherthanexpected costs from projects like the Coastal GasLink pipelineRegarding the companys deleveraging it is good to hear that the management has made deleveraging a priority and thus took their first step of selling 40 of interest in their Columbia Pipelines to GIP in the recent quarter With this transaction the management targets to improve their leverage condition considerably and reach a leverage ratio of 475x As they mentionedIt is worth mentioning that the management made more efforts for deleveraging including filing the sale of its stake in its Nova Gas Transmission System NGTL in Western Canada in  The NGTL system connects the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin which produces most of the natural gas in western Canada to domestic and export markets This selling would assist them in declining their debt levels and incline their capability of providing shareholder returnsFigure 3  TRPs capital structure in millionsDespite TC Energys solid financials and sustainable dividend yield the company is not secure from risks related to temperatures and the impact of climate change on both their services demand and their infrastructures Moreover as mentioned earlier the company is pursuing a highly regulated business model as a result Governments policies and regulations related to decarbonization and energy transition may affect energy supply and demand and TRPs operations and cash flows Moreover TC Energy is growing its investments and increasing its capital spending on several projects If the management cannot pursue their deleveraging process they may face hardship in generating revenue and shareholder distributionsTC Energy has a prominent position to meet energy demand in the future TRP is a leading midstream company that has the largest natural gas networks in the North America Furthermore the spinoff brings the opportunity for the company to generate circa 96 of its adjusted EBITDA from regulated rates and longterm contracts which will diminish their risk of reliance on commodity prices to a great extent Also the management expects to grow their 2022 comparable EBITDA at a 7 comparable annual growth rate by the end of 2026 which brings 35 annual growth for their dividend When all was said and done the companys yeartodate PE ratio is very low which shows that the stock price is very cheap now and will recover Looking ahead I believe that the managements growth business strategy coupled with attractive 75 dividend yield make the stock still appealing for investmentAs always thank you for reading and I appreciate your comments   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or

345,The 10-Year Treasury Rate May Be Heading Over 5%,The 10Year Treasury rate has exploded higher in recent weeks and may still have much further to climb The yield moved above its October highs on Aug 21 rising to 434 its highest in a decade and could reach 5 over the next severalSeveral factors are currently driving higher rates at the long end of the curve One is the massive debt that the US government plans to issue Another reason is that rates in Japan are rising after the Bank of Japan decided to increase the ceiling on its 10year note to 1 from 50 bps Japans accommodative monetary policy has acted as an anchor helping to keep rates globally planted lower Finally growth in the US has been much more robust than expected despite all of the rate hikes and that could be a sign that the economy is just running atIf you look at the 10year rate from a purely technical standpoint it could be heading to around 505 on a conservative basis or 565 when viewing it more aggressively The pattern formed over the last several months appears to be a bull flag a continuation pattern of the previous move higherBut also from a fundamental perspective since 1961 the US 10year typically trades above the core PCE yy inflation rate There have only been a few occasions the 10year rate fell below the core PCE rate in 1974 and 1975 The other time was a fractional move below in 2011 and 2012 and 2016 The current period since 2020 has not only seen the 10year rate trade below core PCE by the most significant amount but the most extended length of time How high the 10year rate needs to rise from here will primarily depend on the path of core inflation and how quickly it continues to come downAdditionally over 10year Treasury rates tend to trade with the velocity of money just a simple ratio of nominal GDP divided by the money supply In this case the broadest measure of the velocity of money or the velocity of MZM has tended to have the strongest relationship with the 10year Treasury rate Now MZM is no longer calculated as of the end of 2020 But since the year 2000 the velocity of M2 for the most part followed the path of the velocity of MZM and what the velocity of M2 shows us is the pace at which money passes through the economy is rising something it hasnt done in many yearsIn its simplest form the supply of M2 is shrinking while nominal GDP growth is rising which tells us that the velocity of M2 or money in general is increasing therefore rates are rising As long as we remain in a period where the velocity of M2 is pushing higher it seems likely that momentum in Treasury rates will continue to go higherOne reason the M2 money supply is falling is that Bank deposits are falling M2 money supply bank deposits track each other closely over time suggesting that the recent turn higher in the M2 money supply isnt likely to last and may flatten out or turn lower from here again As long as the economy remains solid and nominal growth continues to outpace growth in M2 then it seems probable that the velocity of M2 will increase again in the third quarter The bond market may be anticipating that velocity increase so rates are rising to accommodate thatWhile in this case the velocity of money doesnt tell us exactly where rates should be it tells us that the dollars are circulating through the economy quickly and theres great demand for goods and services But with the money supply shrinking at the moment its creating a scenario of rising prices which suggests that inflation will likely be sticking around until the money supply and economic growth come back into balanceThe Fed is trying to deal with the demand side of the equation by raising rates and slowing economic growth But given the size of nominal GDP growth the US economy may require the creation of more money supply at this point to bring supply and demand back into balanceThe recent 10year rise may have to do with more structural changes to the economy and may reflect a market accepting that rates may be permanently higher for longer due to higher economic growth rates and slower growth in the money supply This is likely to have broad impacts on valuations across many asset classes including lower valuation for stocks unless earnings growth rates can compensate for the higher riskfree rate of return helps readers cut through all the noise

346,URA ETF: A Gateway To The Uranium Industry,Global X Uranium  is an ETF that tracks uranium equities Here I describe the reasons to be bullish on uranium the key element in the generation of nuclear energyMy analysis focuses onOn this occasion I havent focused my discussion on the supplydemand balance question facing uranium but you can see this neatly described below in graphic formUranium is used as fuel in nuclear reactors and utilities require uranium to meet the  that is expected to build into the middle of this decade highlighted aboveWithout furtherI believe that nuclear energy has a crucial role to play in complementing green energy sources as we transition towards a more sustainable future While renewable energy sources like solar and wind are undoubtedly vital they do have limitations such as intermittency and energy storage challenges Nuclear power offers a compelling solution by providing a steady lowcarbon source of electricityIll repeat this for emphasis Nuclear power can replace our use of fossil fuels because it has four criteriaIf you notice in the above 4 criteria I could have said the same thing about fossil fuels But nuclear energy brings one more important characteristic to the table its a lowcarbon source This makes nuclear power an essential ally in our battle against climate change By integrating nuclear energy into the energy supply sources we can make substantial strides in reducing our carbon footprint while ensuring a consistent power supplyFurthermore nuclear power provides base load electricity generation contributing to grid stability While renewables rely on weather conditions nuclear reactors can operate continuously delivering a reliable source of electricity day and night This reliability is crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring a consistent power supply even when renewable sources face fluctuations in generationWhats more above we see Siemens Energys  share price one of the biggest manufacturers of wind turbinesWind turbines despite their potential for generating renewable energy often face economic challenges that hinder their viability for a complete energy transition Yes Ive singled out Siemens but you may read around that the impact is broad across both onshore and offshore wind turbines On top of that putting aside the high upfront costs maintaining wind turbines can be prohibitively highHowever I believe one of the biggest problems facing both solar and wind turbines is its struggle with electrical grid integration This is something that I believe is missing from the discussion at a high levelEveryone is focusing on renewable energys lack of reliability to consistently produce energy but too few are considering the substantial amount of energy storage solutions required to make the system viableAlso nuclear energy enhances energy security by  What Im describing here is incorporating nuclear power into our energy mix can bolster our energy resilience and reduce our reliance on fossil fuelsGlobal X Uranium is an ETF that provides investors with exposure to companies involved in the uranium mining industry By investing in this ETF investors can gain exposure to the uranium industry without directly owning the underlying stocks of individual companies The upside here is obvious its a case of diversification that helps spread the risk while offering the potential growth of the nuclear energy sectorAs you can see above nearly a quarter of this ETF is made up of Cameco  Consequently if Cameco continues to perform strongly this ETF will also perform stronglyIt depends on ones view of uranium Recall that many of the companies in the EFT outside Cameco and Kazatomprom the worlds biggest uranium producer are not in production at this point This means they have no revenues or profits Investors are buying into the future prospects of uraniumIve alluded to this above Now to make it more explicit Cameco is a great business But they hedge their production to uranium prices see belowThere are some ladders built into Camecos longterm contracts but for the most part Personally Ive sought to invest in Uranium Energy Corporation  as that business is fully unhedged But as you know that implies substantial volatility Something you will not get with URAIm bullish on Global X Uranium URA The rationale behind my optimism centers on nuclear energys pivotal role as a complementary source of green energy While renewables like solar and wind are crucial they face limitations like intermittency and storage challengesInvesting in Global X Uranium allows exposure to the uranium mining industry without directly owning individual company stocks This ETFs diversification spreads risk while capitalizing on the potential growth of the nuclear energy sector Its important to note that a significant portion of this ETF is tied to Cameco which can positively impact URAs performance if Cameco continues to perform well However one drawback of investing in Global X Uranium is that it may not benefit significantly from surging uranium prices due to its hedging For those seeking less hedged exposure businesses like Uranium Energy Corporation UEC might be worth considering although they will come with greater volatility than URA It very much depends on ones risk appetite and toleranceMy Marketplace highlights a portfolio of

347,Alpha Metallurgical Resources: Set To Double If Met Coal Prices Remain Stable,In my opinion Alpha Metallurgical Resources  presents a buy opportunity particularly for investors interested in a complex yet potentially lucrative play in the commodities arena The company is wellpositioned in the metallurgical coal sector which is poisedAlpha Metallurgical Resources is a mining company specializing in the production and sale of met and thermal coal primarily operating in Virginia and West Virginia What a lot of investors fail to realise is that over 95 of AMRs shipments consist of metallurgical coal meaning that the company is not subject to the secular downtrend which is seen in the demand for thermal coalIn my opinion the investment case for metallurgical coal is often misunderstood overshadowed by the broader narrative surrounding the decline of coal as an energy source While its true that thermal coal faces challenges from renewable energy and environmental regulations metallurgical coal operates in a different market with unique dynamics It commands a higher price due to its specialized role in steel production a sector that sees increased demand as countries develop and modernize their infrastructure This price premium can offer potentially higher returns for investors Additionally the global push for infrastructure growth further boosts the demand for metallurgical coal making it a potentially lucrative investment Unlike thermal coal which is increasingly being replaced by renewable energy sources there are fewer substitutes for metallurgical coal in steel production This lends it a level of market stability that thermal coal lacks I believe that when these factors are considered collectively metallurgical coal emerges as a more attractive and misunderstood investment opportunity compared to thermal coalIn my opinion the future outlook for metallurgical coal is promising particularly when considering global steel demand trends According to forecasts global steel demand is expected to grow at a rate of  through 2024 Even more compelling is the projection for India where steel demand is anticipated to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 44 up to 2050 These figures indicate not only a sustained but also a growing need for steel and by extension metallurgical coal Such growth trajectories in steel demand especially in emerging markets like India bolster the investment case for metallurgical coalWhile the future demand prospects on met coal are positive I believe investors must remember that the cyclical nature of metallurgical coal demand makes it particularly susceptible to economic downturns and sectorspecific crises such as Chinas housing troubles Given that China is one of the worlds largest consumers of steel a housing crisis there would likely result in a significant reduction in construction activities This in turn would diminish the demand for steel and consequently met coal Similarly a global recession would generally lead to a decrease in manufacturing and construction further affecting met coal demand If a macroeconomic downturn was to occur this would almost certainly lower the average met coal selling price therefore causing significant pressure on AMRs margins and free cash flowIn my opinion Alpha Metallurgical Resources is strategically positioned as the USAs largest and most diverse supplier of metallurgical coal a fact underscored by its commanding 21 share of the nations total metallurgical coal production as of 2022 This dominant stance is further amplified by AMRs wellthoughtout shipment mix which is balanced between 30 domestic and 70 international markets India a burgeoning market for steel has been a cornerstone in AMRs export strategy accounting for about 33 of its export sales over the past five years This aligns exceptionally well with Indias projected growth in steel demand Beyond India AMR has wisely diversified its customer base by supplying to other international markets thereby reducing its dependency on any single market I believe this diversified approach significantly bolsters AMRs resilience and growth prospects in the metallurgical coal sectorIn my view Alpha Metallurgical Resources is wellpositioned to capitalize on operational leverage especially given its leading role in the US metallurgical coal market The companys scale allows it to optimize operations and minimize perunit costs effectively This advantage is evident in AMRs 2023 guidance where the average selling price per ton for its met coal segment is projected to be 17842 In contrast the production cost per ton is expected to be around 10900 based on the midpoint of their 2023 guidance This significant margin between selling price and production cost exemplifies how operational leverage can amplify profitability As long as the average selling price for met coal remain close to current level the company is poised to produce significant free cash flowIn my opinion one of the most compelling aspects of Alpha Metallurgical Resources is its ability to manage operating expenses effectively while scaling revenues In 2018 the company reported revenues of  with operating expenses at 13934 million Fast forward to 2022 and AMRs revenue more than doubled to 409299 million Total operating expenses only saw a modest increase to 21898 million This demonstrates that as revenues have grown AMR has been able to keep its operating expenses relatively stable thereby leveraging operational efficiencies to boost profitability This is a strong indicator of effective cost management and operational excellenceAs with any commodity the price action is driven by the fundamental principles of supply and demand and metallurgical coal is no exception to this rule We have already discussed the demand side of met coal as it relates to steel demand However on the supply side in general met coal producers have decreased growth capital expenditure therefore constraining supply of met coal thus enabling and in my opinion sustaining higher than normal met coal prices I believe this supply side constraint to be driven by stricter environmental regulations and a tougher borrowing environment that have made it less favourable for met coal businesses to reinvest back into their own business for growth hence restricting supply of met coal We can see that despite AMRs significant free cash flow generation over the past year the management team has opted to keep capital expenditures relatively in line with prior years which should aid in keeping met coal selling prices well above the production costsAs of the most recent quarter the company reported cash and cash equivalents of  The companys total debt stands at 287 million a modest amount that reflects the managements conservative approach to leverage We can see that AMRs management team are proactive in paying down debt as seen below We can see that since 2020 AMRs debt was reduced from 55170 million down to effectively zero as of today This approach to handling debt significantly reduces risk and protects the business should it enter some sort of major economic downturnSince Q1 2022 Alpha Metallurgical Resources has been actively engaged in share buybacks reducing its shares outstanding from 1917 million to 1625 million as of Q2 2023 based on the average annual shares outstanding This represents a significant decrease of approximately 152 As of July 31 2023 the number of common stock shares outstanding was approximately 137 million Furthermore the company still has 350 million left on its current share repurchase program indicating a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders Interestingly AMR has announced that its dividend program will cease at the end of 2023 While this may initially seem counterintuitive it actually signals that the management team views the business as undervalued by the market By reallocating capital that would have been used for dividends towards additional share buybacks the company aims to capitalize on this perceived undervaluation The management team has expressed intentions to continue allocating capital to buybacks until the market recognizes the real value of AMR In my opinion this strategy reflects a proactive approach to capital allocation and demonstrates confidence in the companys intrinsic value Based on a 25 annual shipment growth over the next 3 years and an annual decrease in average selling price per ton of 5 per year the 2025 expected gross profit is 1125 million Once accounting for other expenses as seen below it is expected that in this scenario that free cash flow will be 594 million 569 million and 542 million for 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively If the free cash flow is then used to repurchase shares the 2025 share count should be around 85 million When implementing the current price to free cash flow of 5 on 2025 free cash flow this gives an end of 2025 share price of 34086 and a CAGR of 26It should be noted that valuing a business that relies on commodity pricing is inherently challenging and the above valuation assumes that the average price of met coal stays around current levels over the next few years Should we enter a recession in the next 12 months it is likely that met coal prices will fall dramatically hence likely so will AMRs share priceI believe that Alpha Metallurgical Resources offers a nuanced but compelling investment opportunity The company stands to benefit from promising longterm demand prospects in the metallurgical coal market which aligns well with global infrastructure growth However its crucial to consider that AMR is not immune to economic downturns given the cyclical nature of met coal Operationally I think AMRs effective use of leverage is a key strength generating significant free cash flow This is further supported by a constrained supply environment that could sustain high met coal prices The companys aggressive share buyback strategy also speaks volumes about managements confidence in its undervalued stock If met coal prices maintain their current levels I believe AMR stock has the potential to double by the end of 2025 offering a lucrative opportunity for investors   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as

348,"As Yields March Higher, JAVA's Value Proposition Remains Unconvincing",I started covering the JPMorgan Active Value ETF  in  with a Hold rating There are two main reasons why I am presenting an update today First the portfolio of this exchangetraded fund has seen a few changes small wonderJAVA was launched in October 2021 and has amassed an AUM of about 6065 million since thenThe JPMorgan  says the fund has an actively managed investment strategy that seeks to deliver a style pure US large cap value equity portfolio as it employs a fundamental bottomup approach to identify quality companies at attractive valuationsAs an actively managed vehicle JAVA has the luxury of boosting exposure to stocks it considers capable of contributing to better performance compared to the Russell 1000 Value index its  and by the same token to sell names that no longer have target characteristics without being constrained by an underlying indexs rebalancingreconstitution rules which is the case with its passively managed counterpartsAnalyzing the JAVA portfolio as of October 17 I have found out that 15 companies were removed in the August version their combined weight was about 36 The 3 most notable deletions were Qorvo  a semiconductor industry player US Foods Holding  a food distributor and KeyCorp  a Clevelandbased diversified bankAt the same time 9 companies were added with Royal Caribbean Cruises  Globe Life  and Silgan Holdings  having the largest weightsIn all in the current iteration there are 150 stocks and REITs in the basket compared to 156 previously As of the August article JAVAs  stood at 56 since then it has risen to 80Interestingly JAVAs sector mix has changed only slightly principally driven by capital appreciationdepreciation of the holdings with healthcare and energy gaining 19 and 15 and financials and IT losing 187 and 157 respectivelyDespite JAVA falling by almost 7 its factor mix has not changed much as the table below demonstratesSince my article was published on August 7 JAVA has declined by almost 7But what were the major culprits To answer that question I have analyzed the performance of 141 stocks that were present in both the August 4 and October 17 versions of the portfolio I have not taken into account newcomers and removed stocks since I was not tracking the portfolio between these dates and I have no data on when exactly these positions were added or deletedAs it can be seen on the chart above a few holdings did deliver a positive price return over that period including Eli Lilly and Company  LLYs stock price surged by 351 amid the GLP1 drug hype But those that were in the red dominated nonetheless More specifically while 39 companies delivered gains 102 saw their stock prices go down with negative returns ranging from just a few bps to almost 31 in the case of Dollar General  The top 5 detractors including DG are compiled in the following table the tables below are based on metrics calculated using data from Seeking Alpha and JAVA unless otherwise notedAll the energy holdings in the group that I analyzed which are predominantly represented by supermajors and EP companies delivered gains ranging from 46 in the case of EOG to 144 in the case of FANG The primary reason is obvious the supply and demand concerns in the oil market have pushed the price of the commodity higherAt the same time all the materials companies were in the redOverall for a better context below are the median returns for each sector The data show materials utilities and consumer staples were the essential detratorsAlso it is worth providing an update on annualized returns and other relevant performance parameters Compared to the previous article data for August and September were added The period in focus now is November 2021September 2023The good news is that while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF  which is a passively managed fund tracking JAVAs benchmark and the iShares Core SP 500 ETF  now have negative annualized returns over the period concerned compared to the lowsingledigit CAGRs they had as of endJuly JAVA is still in the green and its standard deviation is still the lowestHowever since the beginning of the year JAVA has outperformed IWD by just 18 bpsActively managed JAVA puts emphasis on value and quality factors in creating its largecapheavy portfolio However the issue is that though its quality exposure is significant I am not that optimistic regarding value That is to say I believe its value proposition remains unconvincing in the current environment with interest rates  the central concern I see no meaningful reason for an upgrade   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a

You may beginThanks John and good morning everyone Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call The supplemental document is available on our website at prologiscom under Investor

about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as managements beliefs and assumptionsForwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors For a list of those factors please refer toAdditionally our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are nonGAAP and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measuresId likeWith that I will hand the call over to TimThanks Jill Good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year namely growing supply translating to increased market vacancy continued moderation of demand and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability overtimeWe have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing as well as timing of new development Whats incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact its had on rates is delaying decisionmaking and willingness to take expansion space early The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demandIn the meantime and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease marktomarket will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter as well as strong earnings and samestore growthWe remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with longterm secular drivers that remain intact Further the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers ultimately driving occupancy rents and valuesIn terms of our results we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of 133 per share This result includes approximately 003 of onetime items related to interest and termination income as well as the timing of expenses which we can address in QAOccupancy ticked up over the quarter to 975 aided by retention of 77 Net effective rent change was a record 84 at our share with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200 Toronto at 187 and Southern California at 165 Samestore growth on a net effective and cash basis was 93 and 95 respectively driven predominantly by rent changeWe saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter the slower pace embedded in our forecast In combination with the strong build of inplace rents our lease marktomarket recalculates to 62 as of SeptemberWe raised approximately 14 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 32 comprised principally of 760 million within our ventures as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability In combination with our cash position we ended the quarter with a record 69 billion of liquidityFinally its noteworthy that our debttoEBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year hovering in the mid4 times range despite our increased financing activity a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDATurning to our markets while rising vacancy remains historically very low in the US Mexico and Europe Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the US driven by low absorption as well as recently delivered but unleased completions Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis pointsAt the macro level our expectations for the US are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters Then over the subsequent three quarters we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet That trend may extend further into 2025 as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain lowWhatever the precise path we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the longterm our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform In this regard our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quartersIn coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions its clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint increasing capacity and resiliency However whats also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environmentIn the US rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt MidAtlantic and Northern California regions Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarterRents across our Southern California submarkets declined approximately 2 as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy While the markets and outlook are mixed we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the US and globally over the coming year albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbedFrom our appraisals US values declined approximately 3 while European values remain stable in fact having a very modest writeup The difference isnt too surprising as the Feds language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the US capital markets driving the 10year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call compared to the burn ph at just 50 basis pointsWe believe that this is likely another instance as we saw one year ago where US appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisalbased activity in USLF for at least one quarter Elsewhere values in Mexico are up 85 while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 65 a writedown that we dont believe has fully run its courseOur funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately 180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of 115 million Given other activity in the quarter the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of 16 billion to approximately 700 million or roughly 2 of thirdparty AUMsIn terms of our own deployment development starts ramped up during the quarter crossing 1 billion over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bankAlso notable is the acquisition of 118 million of land including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total buildout of land globally to over 40 billionWe are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business our energy business and their adjacencies Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve we see the environment as rich with opportunityMoving to guidance We are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 9725 and 975 As a result we are increasing our samestore guidance to a range of 9 to 925 on a net effective basis and 975 to 10 on a cash basisWe are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance excluding promotes to a range of 520 million to 530 million and adjusting GA guidance to range between 390 million and 395 millionOur development starts guidance is increased to a new range of 3 billion to 35 billion at our share driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier We have 500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of 17 billion to 23 billionIn the end we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of 330 per share to 335 per share We are increasing our core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of 558 per share to 560 per share and are increasing core FFO excluding promotes to a range between 508 per share and 510 per share growth of nearly 105I know that many of you are focusing on 2024 so Id like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the samestore pool in 2024 which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash samestore growth This is of course because Duke rents were marktomarket at close one year ago so its contribution to net effective samestore growth and earnings will be minimal even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolioIn closing we are navigating the current environment assured that whatever the economy brings in the shortterm we are positioned to outperform over the longterm This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and thats been central to our strategy and management as a companyId like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York our first in four years We are looking forward to spending the day with you sharing more about our business outlook and opportunities ahead Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press releaseAnd with that I will hand it back to the Operator for your questionsThank you Operator Instructions And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS Please proceed with your questionGood morning Thanks a lot for taking my question I mean Tim can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks You talked about maybe softer demand but then theres  you are calling for accelerating the number of buildtosuit developments At the same time occupancy has been stronger than anticipated and thats before the lower development starts hit the market So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supplydemand dynamics as we exit 2023 and into 2024 ThanksSure Demand is definitely softer Its closer to normal maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about buildtosuits but they are reluctant to pull the Technical DifficultyAnd the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi Please proceed with your questionHey guys Let me know if you are having trouble hearing me because I am having trouble hearing you But I just wanted to touch on the data center buildtosuits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yields on the overall development starts And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one the plan on whether you are going to hold this or anticipate selling it upon completion of that and just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of the data center salesLadies and gentlemen please remain on the line We are just having a little technical difficulty here Thank you Please remain on the lineI am sorry We are having some technical difficulties here and I cant really explain itHelloCan you guys hear me You can hear me again Okay So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question To the extent I heard it which wasnt great On the first question what I wanted to say is that the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the buildtosuits and thats why they are higher But industrial logistics buildtosuits are kind of in par and in line with our expectationsThe reason occupancy is higher its unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases but market occupancy is slightly lower So we are outperforming the market by more than we did beforeI think that covers the first question The second question was how should we think about the buildtosuits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like and for that I am going to turn it over to Dan hereBut generally we  the buildtosuits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and bestuse strategy We own a lot of highquality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center marketsAnd while we may occasionally buy land for data centers our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward its going to be a pretty significant part of our activity although its lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business but you will hear more about thatNow strategically this is important to understand We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012 The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was nonstrategic to us logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositionsYou can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth Thats where the growth capital is going to come from We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of longterm ownership its more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward Dan you want to talk about the initial yields on the data centerWell what I would say is on this particular data center we are under a strict confidentiality So we cant be speaking about any particular yield points by any means But what I would say is we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forwardWhat I would say generally though without getting specific on this opportunity we think the margins that come out of our data center business by definition based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics buildout So multiples of a normal marginAnd the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI Please proceed with your questionYeah Thanks and good morning I just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand on the fourth quarter I think you have got something like 19 billion of planned starts given that you have done about 14 billion yeartodate So just curious does that include other data centers or is that all traditional industrial And if so kind of what is the mix between spec and buildtosuit on that fourth quarter starts volume ThanksSure Steve This is Dan So the lions share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts We have one maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted But overall its about 5050 buildtosuit and spec And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a backend loaded forecast for about four quarters nowAs we talk about market development starts now at 65  I guess down 65 from the peak this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volumeYeah The portion of buildtosuit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus buildtosuitCorrectAnd the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets Please proceed with your questionHi Thanks Question as you think about 2024 Tim you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter Thats down from 25 last quarter I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you are anticipating do you see potential for sequential or yearoveryear decreases in market rents in the US or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that timeframeHey Todd Its Chris Caton Thanks for the question Yes We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer but by and large markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflationAnd the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs Please proceed with your questionHi everyone Maybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little I know its not as large of an activity as developments but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes at an industry level are down significantly You did the 3 billion acquisition midyear So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today Could you talk a little bit about who you are buying from maybe why they are selling and how you get comfortable on what the right price should beSure Its a dynamic market and I think thats the essence of your question Its really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions But heres a model for thinking about itFirst of all we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio We are not  before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didnt want which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it but we dont expect that to be the case going forward So we are really being picky about what we buy The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100 whole portfoliosSecondly if you really think that look at where treasuries are 150 basis points have gone to call it 45 300 basis points increased Those kinds of properties core properties we are trading in the high 5s low 6 IRRs Lets stay away from cap rates because of a markettomarket complexity of talking about cap rates But call it 6So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields simplistically you would have to see a 9 on leveraged IRR and thats if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium We get a sense that theres going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capitalconstrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of thoseI dont think theres going to be distress in the terms of a postsavings and loan crisis or any of the downturns but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9 handle on them maybe as much as 95 depending on the circumstances And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market So expect to see more transactions in the next six months Dan do you have anything to addThe only thing I would add is our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily And this is land acquisitions this is core acquisitions its valueadd acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now So its really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction But overall I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returnsAnd the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets Please proceed with your questionThank you I just wanted to clarify so you are expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall And I am wondering if during that time period are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that And also if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023Yeah On the rental forecast I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarterbyquarter forecasting of rents Its hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis much less on a quartertoquarter forecast So what was the first part of the question Oh occupancy tradeoffOccupancyIt depends on the actual markets There are about 20 of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80 of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it which is how do you expect that to change And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that I mean just look at the starts They are down 65 and even with moderating demand we are going to get something like 60 or 70 of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters So theres no sense really going cheap its just But I would say 20 of our markets we are going to be more focused on occupancyAnd the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank Please proceed with your questionOh Thanks Just a twoporter on Southern California So I guess first I wanted to see if you are seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved the worker strikes impacting LA Basin or Inland Empire if you are seeing any benefit there and pick up any activity And then secondly just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you have cited there in rents in Southern California what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolioWell Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows 40 of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issuesIts too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything thats going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flowsAbout half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern CaliforniaI am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers Chris do you want to add anythingYeah I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softerAnd the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America Please proceed with your questionGood morning First a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis And then appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and theres little that could change your core outlook from here but want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into your end What could change your views more positively or negatively Thank youHey Camille Its Tim Yeah Just a clarification on the first part that was a quarteroverquarter number in SoCal the 2 decline And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter the answer is very little at this point Certainly on the rent change side of things most all of that leasing is already inked We could have some surprises very moderate I would say on the occupancy side but I actually dont expect that We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know So I dont think you will see anything take us outside of our guidanceAnd the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley Please proceed with your questionHey Just a quick twoparter followup Just one on the development starts and the data centers which is intriguing Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually Is it 200 million is it 500 million like how big can this get is the followup number one And then number two on sort of the rent growth appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers but as you are sort of thinking about next year what are sort of the key markets Southern California being one potentially being sort of a headwind Maybe can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year ThanksOkay Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because thats what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business our data center business and all those things So let me defer answering that question to that dateAnd by the way even on that date you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like I just tell you that in advance because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in Chris do you want to address the second partYeah Absolutely I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development So over a mediumterm horizon a couple years thats going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growthAs it relates to different markets which was your question I think its probably fair to point to Tims comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year MidAtlantic Sunbelt Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the US and there is a range of them globally whether its Toronto Mexico Germany and the Netherlands So thats what I would look toAnd the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays Please proceed with your questionHi Good morning I guess one more on market rent growth I think last quarter you gave a 2023 forecast of 7 to 9 I dont know if you updated that today and are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forwardSo hey the view is 7 in United  globally and in the US We are about mid6s so far this year so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier And then as it relates to forward guidance Id like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new informationAnd the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets Please proceed with your questionYeah Thanks How does the 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next three quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023 Now correct me if I am wrong I believe that you highlighted that theres going to be about 150 million square foot gap in 2023 I mean is that still a fair assumption or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of widened that out a little bitHi Thanks for the question Again its Chris So just to give you the total numbers we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption So that gap is widerAnd some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline If anything our view of where the pipelines going has come down not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really its really timing as it relates to that gapYeah But I would say our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid3s not mid4s maybe mid to high 3s and not mid4s or approaching 5 So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand outBut the thing that encourages me and we will have to see  wait to see this is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their longterm needs and are buildtosuit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles But they are not pulling the trigger just yet given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the Csuite pretty tightly these daysAnd the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho Please proceed with your questionThanks I just wanted to get a better sense of you talked about deferring growth I guess across SoCal  in rent growth across SoCal MidAtlantic I think you referenced Sunbelt Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion And I guess Chris do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next call it six months to monthsSo the magnitude of the dispersion so just to be clear in terms of strengths versus weaknesses because I want to be sure that wasnt conflated the strong markets include the MidAtlantic Sunbe, , ,0
350,"Heartland Express Looks Undervalued, But The Trucking Cycle Has Struggled To Find A Bottom In 2023",One of the challenges of investing in cyclical companies is that no two cycles are ever the same and that creates a lot of modeling challenges In the truckload or TL part of the trucking industry for instance capacity has been slower toThis makes sense  smaller carriers went into this downturn with more cash in the bank after the boom so could withstand lower rates for longer and inventories were inflated by companies needing to keep higher inventories on hand to offset supply chain risk  but it has nevertheless complicated modeling and led to a lot of disappointment this year In particular both shipping volumes and pricing have been weaker than I expected and what looked like a 2H 3 recovery is nowSince   shares have lost a little less than 10 of their value Thats not too bad relative to other TL carriers   is down 13   is down over 10 and   is down 15 while   is down about 2 but I wasnt recommending Heartland as an earlystage trucking recovery play on the basis of smaller losses though the stock did work modestly for about four months At this point I do think Heartland remains undervalued and I think the trucking cycle is bottoming out but thus far lights at the end of the tunnel have been additional oncoming trains so I understand investors wanting to stay away until theres real evidence of an upturnEvery trucking cycle is different and every trucking cycle is the sameWhat I mean by that is that boom times drive strong increases in rates and small capacity providers push into the market to get their piece of the pie Eventually the economyfreight demand cools that balance of capacity supply and demand shifts to excess and prices start falling Those falling prices pinch established carriers like Heartland and KnightSwift but theyre even more damaging to small carriers and eventually that capacity is forced out of the market Then the economyfreight demand recovers theres insufficient capacity to meet that new demand and we do it all over againThis cycle has followed that basic pattern but with some important twists The pandemic hammered capacity with reduced demand idling drivers and many older owneroperators deciding to leave the business At the same time the postpandemic period saw a surge in business activity and shipping demand leading to a big swing in rates and demand for capacity which in turn drove demand for truck brokerage services from companies like   KnightSwift   et alThe net effect of all of this is that shipping demand was far higher than normal capacity came in to meet it and rates were quite healthy That generated substantial cash for smaller operators and that cash is part of the reason why this downturn has been stretched out Dry van spot rates are down about 16 yearoveryear as of early October and while the rate declines seen in 2023 would normally be enough to push a lot of capacity out of the market rates have been below cash operating costs for small operators for some time those operators have been able to rely upon and draw down that cash built up during the boomThe bottom line for Heartland is pretty simple Freight demand has fallen off considerably in 2023 due in part to a significant inventory destocking cycle and with too much capacity in the market and larger carriers reluctant to let go of drivers prices and profitability have crumbledThere have been some signs of a bottom here of late The big inventory correction cycle seems to be petering out and there is some evidence that this years peak season may be stronger as demand still hasnt fallen off too bad Capacity has started to leave the market but is still too high and prices seem to be bumping along at low levelsA big part of the Heartland story for 20232025 was and still is the synergy opportunities from integrating the large Smith and CFI acquisitions both of which closed in 2022 Neither of these carriers operate as efficiently as Heartland and driving costs out of these businesses and bringing them in line with core Heartland efficiency management has targeted low80s for operating ratios was going to be a meaningful earnings driverThat story can still work but its very much on hold for now With revenue excluding fuel basically flat on an organic basis in the second quarter there just isnt enough volume and price leverage to drive those efficiencies Not only is Heartland not operating its fleet at maximum efficiency more deadhead miles fewer overall shipments et al operating costs are higher with inflation in wages parts and so on Thats driven the overall operating ratio back into the mid90s adjusted with Smith and CFI both in the high90s in the last quarterHeartland is also reaping less benefit from gains on sale Heartland maintains a very modern fleet typically selling tractors after around two years of use Keeping the fleet age low reduces operating and maintenance costs and keeps drivers happier but Heartland generally relies on smaller carriers to buy their used equipment With capacity exiting the market though that demand has dried up and gains on sale have shrunk this year in response management has also cut back on its net capex leading to modest creep in average tractor age 21 years versus 19 in the last quarterI dont see any reason to expect that third quarter earnings will be strong Around six months ago the Street was expecting 025 in EPS for the third quarter and even 90 days ago the estimate was still 019 Now the expectation is 008 and I wouldnt be shocked if the company misses due to a higher operating ratio Likewise I think the Street very much wants to hear that not only has the market bottomed but there are already signs of improving demand including a stronger peak season I do think that may be too much to hope for and I see a risk of a lackluster peak season and an extended bumping along the bottom  as I dont expect a big inventory rebuild cycle nor a strong retail seasonHeartland really doesnt do spotrate business but spot rates do inform contract rates and I see a risk that large carriers like Heartland will be in a poor bargaining position for the next round of rate negotiations There just isnt a lot of demand now and even though carriers like Heartland will argue that they need rate support to offset operating costs customers likely wont see a compelling need to pay up The risk then is that while the market does recover in 2024 from a volume standpoint price could still be a headwind and that the real recovery gets pushed into 2025Im still looking for longterm revenue growth in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 but a lot of that comes from the bump this year from the Smith and CFI deals Long term I expect core growth to be more on the order of 2 Further consolidation could offer some upside but time will tell On the margin side I do expect a significant decline in free cash flow margins in FY 3 and FY 4 as the company absorbs higher operating costs and resumes capex in FY 4 Longer term I still think lowtomidteens FCF margins are attainable driving midsingledigit normalized FCF growthWhile Heartland does look undervalued on a discounted cash flow approach the intense cyclicality of the business makes it very difficult to rely on longterm modeling Turning to multiplebased approaches like EVEBITDA and PE is not much easier given the challenges in selecting the right multiples and earnings numbers  2022 2023 and 2024 results arent really representative of normal operating conditionsI can use 1 in EPS for 2025 and a 17x longterm cycle average PE to generate a 17 target but its worth noting that that 2025 number has come down sharply in six months Likewise I can argue for a 65x multiple on 2023 EBITDA which gives me an 18 target but at some point you have to be wary of picking numbers that give you the result you want  to that point if I look at prior PEs on trough earnings it would seem that 30x my 2023 EPS estimate of 042 would be appropriate and that only gets me to 1260 for a fair valueI do think that Heartland shares are undervalued and that the trucking cycle has bottomed out but I also thought that six months ago and that was clearly the wrong call I think investors can do okay from here with these shares but I cant guarantee that there wont be another round of guidanceexpectation cuts as this correction drags on into 2024 If you can take the risk of being early this is a name to consider but its definitely not for those investors who struggle to cope

351,"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce: Better, But Still Bad",Canada can be a myopic place There I wrote it In some ways this is understandable If your next door neighbour was very loud very friendly blasted movies and music at you 247 and occasionally fired off a few hundred bazooka rounds in their big backyard with theWith all that out of the way its time to venture down the rabbit hole of writing about yet another beloved Canadian bank This time Im going to review the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  known from this time forward in my article as CIBC Im also going to try to address some of the responses to my Royal Bank article in this one Im going to start my discussion of this bank with a few more points about residential real estate in Canada Ill also include portions of an email exchange I had with a member of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions OSFI Canadas banking regulatorI know that my writing can be uh a bit much  and for that reason I post a thesis statement paragraph very near the beginning of each of my articles This gives investors the chance to review my thinking and then get out before theyre exposed to too many bad jokes and too much proper spelling I think it behooves investors to seek the best risk adjusted returns and I think the risk here is too great The financial snapshot is not particularly inspiring in my view and the exposure to Canadian residential real estate is troubling in my view The mortgage book has grown dramatically over the past few years so this problem has gotten worse not better Additionally those who think the regulators are going to cut the banks some slack in the parlance of our times are in for a rude shock Before getting into CIBC specific financials though I continue to dismantle the bullish case for Canadian residential real estate that I started when I wrote about Royal Bank of Canada yesterdayIn this first section I want to make a few more arguments for why I think residential real estate in Canada is a ridiculous investment For more please review my article on Royal Bank In my view the fortunes of Canadian banks are inexorably tied to residential real estate for two reasons First and most directly much of the growth the big five have enjoyed over the past several years has come from mortgages and I think this growth will inevitably slow Second Canadian banks particularly Royal and CIBC go as the Canadian economy goes The Canadian economy goes as Canadian residential real estate goes and thus a drop in residential real estate prices will have a knock on negative wealth effect for Canadians which will harm loan growth This will harm bank profits obviouslyThe people who are aware of the coming population crisis in the developed world will tell you that the problem will be solved with immigrationThis isnt just a Canadian phenomenon because Ive heard the same solutions offered by Europeans and Australians When the subject of the demographic timebomb comes up in conversation nearly every person Ive talked to says some variation of immigrants will solve the problem Well thats great in theory and Ill admit that Canada has been very welcoming to immigrants since about 1970 but immigrants are increasingly being wooed by a number of places that arent unbelievably coldEven with a welcoming immigration culture though population growth has been anemic for decades For instance in 1970 the population of the country was about 214 million people Today the population is about 39 million people so its grown at a CAGR of about 112 over the past 53 years This is because people also emigrate and they also die Further the United Nations is projecting that Canadian population growth rate will actually slow to a CAGR of about 058 over the next 30 Add to that the fact that prices are  dramatically and the immigrants to the rescue thesis seems even more absurd in my view To sum up so far in order to be bullish on residential real estate in Canada you need to believe that the country will buck a 53 year trend and will start to grow more rapidly in spite of what the United Nations is suggesting Additionally immigrants are going to want to flock to the place in spite of the fact that Canada has some of the most expensive housing stock on Earth What would be the marketing pitch to immigrants Come for the sometimes deadly cold stay for the unaffordability of our housingIts time to write about supply I would strongly agree with the notion that theres a housing supply  in Canada In my view people misinterpret this though They take from this shortage of supply that prices will remain elevated In my view this justification of current house prices ignores a key element of the supplydemand relationship demand Demand for housing may be very inelastic but the population is as the kids say tapped out  so they cannot afford continuously elevated prices and thus price has nowhere to go but down This is exactly what happened to Canadian residential real estate in the months after the above article from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation  was published Prices have fallen in spite of the housing supply shortage mentioned by CMHCI admit that I forget the class at which I learned this but I remember being tied to the oar of the MBA slave ship and hearing something about supply and demand are not constants Translated this means that sometimes supply is the preeminent determinant of price and sometimes demand I think falling prices in the teeth of a housing shortage convinces me that demand is key hereI think the stress test elevated interest rates sclerotic population growth the fact that Canadians especially younger households are some of the most  people on Earth Younger households are particularly important to real estate demand for pretty obvious reasons In my view all of this conspires to make residential real estate a risky bet in Canada shortage or no shortageBecause a larger proportion of my audience for this article is likely Canadian and Ive just uttered some blasphemies Ill make the point by analogy Lets pretend that the years 1636 and a smaller and smaller percentage of the Dutch population can afford those beautiful Semper Augustus tulips that everyones always going on about At some point the price will have to fall no matter how beautiful the resulting flowersThat quick little analogy to tulipmania reminds me of a chart I included in yesterdays article about Royal Bank Its relevant here too so once again feast your eyes on the relationship between income and house prices Pay particular attention to that little spike of American house prices above affordability in 2008 Doesnt it look kind of quaint when compared to the Canadian leviathan bubbleSo if youre buying CIBC based on the assumption that the past growth in the mortgage book will be repeated I would suggest that you reconsider that notion In my view residential real estate is increasingly unaffordable in Canada and this will impact mortgage loan growth It may also impact the bank in unprecedented ways The ways are unprecedented because we have no historical record of anything like thisI think when talking about Canadian banks it would be a good idea to have an interaction with the one institution that they all seem to be terrified of The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions OSFI so I reached out to those good people via electronic mail or email as the young people call itA few real estate bulls Ive talked to over the past while have suggested that people who took on huge mortgages to buy overpriced real estate will be fine because the banks are just going to extend their amortization schedules to keep things nice and affordable I reached out to OSFI to clarify this point Below Ive reproduced my question and the response from the officialSo we can dispense with the idea that people will be fine because they can simply extendBefore we leave our discussion of OSFI it seems that theyre imposing new capital requirements on lenders To  them directlyTo beat the proverbial dead horse as is my wont if the Value in loantovalue declines as I think it will this will impose greater capital requirements on the banks which is not a wonderful development from their perspectiveReturning to the discussion on CIBC when reviewing the financial performance here over the past several years a few elements pop off the virtual page at me First the most recent six months has been less profitable than the previous year in spite of an uptick in revenue Rising sales and falling profits is never a great sign in my view Additionally we cant blame this on an unfortunate comparison period given that net income over the past two quarters was about 17 lower than it was during the same period in 2019 I think a fair point could be made to suggest that the company hasnt yet returned to prepandemic levels of profitabilityAt the same time the capital structure has deteriorated somewhat in my view with total liabilities up from the previous year by about 33 million or 39Most worrying of all from my point of view is the fact that the mortgage book is today about 30 greater than it was in 2019 and now sits around 2714 billion For reference shareholder equity currently sits at about 5151 billion Using the arithmetic skills not so lovingly beaten into me by the good sisters at Holy Spirit School many decades ago Ive managed to work out that equity represents about 19 of the current mortgage bookAll of this suggests to me that Id need to be compensated for taking on the risks associated with this business Id be compensated for that with a higher than usual dividend yield or a cheaper than usual stockAs my regulars know I look for stocks that are trading at a discount to both their own history and the overall market This is because I think cheap stocks represent that perfect combination of lower risk and higher return potential Theyre lower risk because much of the bad news has already been baked in to the price so new bad news wont drive things much lower They offer great potential returns because any moderately good news drives the shares higher Incidentally this keep expectations limited has been the primary strategy Ive used in my dating life and its worked out pretty well for me at leastAnyway I measure cheapness in a few ways ranging from the simple to the more complex On the simple side I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value like sales earnings free cash flow and the like Id note that CIBC shares are cheaper than the overall market at the moment but are hardly cheap when judged against their own history This is troubling in my view because the level of risk here has risen materially The one thing the stock has going for it though is the fact that the shares are sporting a positive risk premium at the momentSource YChartsSource YChartsThe question for most investors is whether this dividend yield is worth the risk here Specifically in the Great White  youre picking up an extra 124 basis points over the risk free rate while in the land

352,Buy MGIC: This Time Mortgage Credit Really Is Different,First I know I write incessantly about private mortgage insurers I cant help it I just think they are generally ignored and frequently misunderstood when not ignored Most importantly I am confident they remain quite cheap to their likely outcomesSecond a shoutout to me Yes pretty obnoxious But my last piece on MGIC  was a compareandcontrast piece versus Redfin  a related company in the housing space Seeking Alpha published my article  on July 12 barely four weeks ago Since then MGIC is up 10 and Redfin is down 34 Hopefully this fact will get you to read further down in this article43 years So the current state of mortgage credit  pretty different from what we have experienced during our investing lives  It is different this time for this combination of reasonsMortgage defaults rise when some combination of three events occurIll address the home price decline risk first The law of supply and demand says that prices of any product fall when there is an excess of supply In housing a supply excess is indicated by a high vacancy rate You judge from this chart whether singlefamily housing has excess supplyThe exact opposite of excess supply Housing vacancies havent been this low in our investing lifetime It would take many years of overbuilding to create excess housing So the risk of a sharp decline in home prices seems remote Even the dramatic rise in mortgage rates from 3 to 7 over the past 1½ years barely dented home pricesAgain I rely on the supplydemand law A sharp fall in demand for labor always creates the risk of rising unemployment But we also need to keep on eye on growth in the supply of labor So lets do that This chart shows changes in the US rate of change in the labor force measured as 5year rolling averages to smooth out temporary blips I then added the unemployment rate against using a 5year averageThe chart clearly shows that labor force growth has slowed a lot over the past four decades helping the unemployment rate trend lower In fact unfilled jobs currently total nearly 10 million about double the average over the last few decadesSo yes a rise in unemployment due to a sharp decline in demand will be a risk for mortgage insurers But that risk is lower than average now because of a material labor shortagePerhaps the most important risk of rising mortgage defaults is caused by weak mortgage lending standards And this is the best news yetThe mortgage industry and the MIs in particular have generated outstanding quality home loans for well over a decade For proof I turn first to more MBA data this time a historical index of mortgage lending standardsMore evidence of conservative lending standards is supplied by looking at the share of mortgage debt outstanding underwritten by the private sector not the government  Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and the FHAVA You might expect that government programs would be looser than private business loans but that was not the case during the early  0s housing bubble the risky subprime and other whacky loans were very largely private sector products Private sector credit was 33 of total home loans in  9 That percentage is now below 20MGICs shift to more conservative lending has been radical as shown by this history of paid claims on mortgage defaultsThis chart is stunning Claims payments this year will be the lowest since at least 1995 as far back as currently available data And compare the 45 million or so of claims payments this year to 2005 the peak of the early  0s housing bubble Default payments in  5 were 612 million times largerAnd if the economy takes a big hit 86 of MGICs risk is covered by reinsurance that pays in the event of a material recessionAgain home loan quality different this timeMGICs operating EPS was 060 after my adjustment for loss reserve accounting which added 008 to MGICs reported operating EPS That compares to 053 my estimate a year ago The results were good enough to cause Wall Street analysts to raise their average  3 EPS estimate to 231 from 215Claims paid were a mere 12 million on a 292 billion insurance book That is a tiny 16 bp loss rate But nearly 70 of the claims MGIC paid were from loans originated prior to 2009 That means the insurance MGIC wrote since 2009 had a Q2 loss rate of a miniscule 07 bp This time is differentTwo more pieces of good news from Q2MGIC will generate about 700 million of cash flow this year or about 250 per share That is a 14 return on the stock price And basically all of that cash flow can be paid to shareholders Thats because MGIC has 13 billion of excess capital above its regulatory capital requirement plus a 40 capital cushionIn fact during the first half of this year MGIC paid shareholders 59 million in dividends and 150 million in share repurchases for an 8 annualized return to shareholders I expect it to return more to shareholdersMGIC can very comfortably use 350 million of cash flow per year to buy back stock At the current price that means a 7 decline to shares outstanding and a therefore a 7 annual increase in cash flow per share without any increase in dollar earnings Not bad for a stock with a 14 current cash flow yieldI believe that 25 is a conservative valuation for MGIC Its cash return would then be 10 with a 57 growth rate for the foreseeable future Thats a 40 upside

353,Depression Alert: Why The Shrinking Money Supply Spells Trouble For SPY,The US economy is currently experiencing a rare event that hasnt been witnessed since 1949 a shrinking money supply M2 has declined by a whopping 700 billion since the hiking cycle began This phenomenon is In this article we will explore why the US money supply is shrinking and delve into its potentially negative implications for SPY and the broader financial landscapeThe recent contraction in the US money supply is not solely due to a single isolated cause Rather it is a result of a complex interplay of factors that have evolved over time including changes in Federal Reserve policy rising interest rates financial innovations and shifts in market dynamicsWe will discuss the three most prominent of these factors below One significant contributor to the shrinking money supply is the change in Federal Reserve policy away from quantitative easing and towards quantitative tightening The Fed has been reducing its massive 8 trillion balance sheet so far to the tune of 800 billion which in turn has had a direct impact on savings deposits because as the Fed rolls off assets like Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities as they reach maturity it reduces the money supply since these assets instead need to be financed by bank deposits or other forms of money Additionally rising interest rates  which have pushed yields higher in numerous financial products such as money markets  have discouraged individuals and institutions from keeping their funds in lowyield savings and checking accounts leading to a decline in deposits Moreover the continued growth in credit and debit card adoption by consumers has reduced the reliance on physical cash for everyday transactions while the years of ultralow interest rates the growing digitization of financial markets and the rise of userfriendly commissionfree trading apps like Robinhood  have made it easier and more attractive for households to allocate their savings to investments rather than traditional bank deposits Yes interest rates have risen recently but many individuals have already been activated as investors and have formed the habit of allocating excess savings to stocks rather than to a bank savings accountThese three major factors have led to a staggering 24 trillion decline in savings deposits since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in early 2022So what does the shrinking US money supply mean for SPY The reality is quite nuancedOne of the most accurate ways of measuring the relationship between the money supply and SPY performance is its impact on interest rates though the relationship between interest rates and stock market performance is complex Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixedincome assets more attractive relative to stocks As investors seek higher yields in bonds there might be a shift away from equities like those in SPY thereby hurting its performance We have seen this dynamic at play recently as surging bond yields have weighed on SPYs performanceConversely when interest rates are very low investors seeking returns are inclined to invest in riskier assets like stocks driving their prices higher due to increased demand This was one of the main reasons why SPY boomed over the decade between 2012 and 2021 especially in the aftermath of the COVID19 outbreakAnother reason why interest rates have an impact on SPY is that  when market interest rates rise  it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money for profitable projects leading to higher interest payments and lower profits In some cases projects may become unfeasible Lower profits translate to lower stock prices because stock prices are a reflection of a companys future earnings Conversely when interest rates fall companies can borrow more easily boosting profits and economic growth A classic recent example of this was seen at NextEra Energy Partners  where management just  its target growth rate in half due to a soaring cost of capitalMoreover Goldman Sachs  that interest rates are one of the more reliable indicators for estimating the impact of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions on the economy which in turn can assist us with predicting SPY performance In fact one of the more prominent SP 500 valuation models in use today is known as the That said while interest rates certainly do  in the behavior of stock markets they are also influenced by a myriad of other factors including investor sentiment economic conditions corporate earnings and geopolitical events While changes in the money supply can play a role in shaping economic conditions they are just one piece of the broader puzzle As a result historical data reveals that relying solely on monetary aggregates for predicting market performance can be unreliableFortunately for SPY its  are in cashrich technology megacap stocks like Apple  Microsoft  Amazon  Nvidia  Alphabet   Tesla  and Meta  as well as one of the strongest conglomerates in the world in Berkshire Hathaway  This should make it more resistant to higher for longer interest rates than some other financial instruments out there That said there are still reasons to be concerned First of all SPY is quite overvalued based on several leading valuation models such as the Buffett Indicator the PriceEarnings Model the SP 500 Mean Reversion Model and the Yield Curve ModelMoreover as a  pointed outWhen a contraction in the money supply is coupled with inflation such as we are seeing now there is an elevated threat of the market and broader economy experiencing a deflationary crash This would undoubtedly have a terrible impact on SPY Similar circumstances occurred in the postWorld War I era and the Spanish Flu pandemic resulting in 11 deflation and high unemployment A mere 2 contraction in the money supply in 1921 triggered this deflationary depression and currently in 2023 we are already at a 2 contraction This suggests that the economys resilience and the current inflation may not be as robust as believedWhile the money supply in 2023 is substantially higher than prepandemic levels history indicates that depressions and deflation do not require a linear decrease in the money supply but can result from even a slight contraction of 24 yearonyear Many expect the current inflation to persist indefinitely akin to the 1970s but the key difference is that the Federal Reserve is engaged in Quantitative Tightening right now causing the money supply to contract As a result economic history seems to indicate that a deflationary depression in the near future is a possibility unless the Federal Reserve changes course away from QTThe currently shrinking US money supply is a historically rare and complex phenomenon driven by multiple factors including changes in Federal Reserve policy rising interest rates and financial innovation While there are reasons to believe that it could bode poorly for SPY  particularly given that rising interest rates often follow and are mechanically bad for equity valuations SPY appears to be overvalued based on numerous models and a shrinking money supply dramatically increases the chances of depression  it is also important to keep in mind that the relationship between the money supply and stock market performance is not straightforwardAs a result while this analysis does lead us to be bearish on SPY and rate it a Sell we do not think that longterm investors should overreact sell everything and head for the hills in a panic However it does emphasize the importance of proper diversification and having a financial plan that does not depend on liquidating SPY shares for several years to come Samuel Smith is Vice

354,Mid-America Apartment Communities: 4% Yielder Positioned For A Solid Performance,MidAmerica Apartment Communities  is a pureplay US apartment REIT and is one of the few REITs included in the SP 500 As of June 30 2023 MAA had over 101000 apartment homes in its portfolio spread across 16 states and the DistrictMost of the apartment buildings are of a high quality where 92 of all buildings are classified as B or higherThe existing tenant base is also greatly diversified with no major exposures towards a particular segment of economyAll in all MAA can be considered a rather defensive REIT with an exposure towards specific REIT sector which enjoys secular tailwinds and if properly managed can deliver stable and predictable returns going forwardTypically apartment REITs have the optionality to grow organically via directing part of the total CapEx spend towards improving or redeveloping the existing asset stock Acquisitions which are based on higher cap rates than the cost of capital also play an important role but usually are more procyclical depending on the prevailing spread cap rates  WACC and companys ability to attract sound financingWe can see that in MAAs case the net acquisitions for 2023 are projected to land at 400 million which accounts for roughly 25 of the total market cap This is conservativeThe chart above reflecting MAAs dividend history is a clear testament of the Companys conservatism and stability which have supported 117 consecutive dividend payments with some growth component attach almost each yearAt the same time MAA has managed to register more solid dividend hikes in the past two years by capitalizing on the prevailing sectorspecific tailwinds ie favourable supply and demand dynamics which put an upward pressure on the rent levels and its fortress balance sheetIn my humble opinion MAA is positioned to deliver superior returns relative to the broader REIT market over the foreseeable future where there is an increased probability of distress and higherforlonger interest rate scenarioIt is a combination of two factors which differentiate MAA from its peers and equips the Company to benefit from the volatility in the real estate marketMAA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the entire REIT space and is only one of eight publicly traded REITs which carry an upper investment grade credit ratingCompared to 15 direct peers operating in the REIT Apartments segment MAA has the second strongest balance sheet in terms of debt to EBITDA and debt ratio On an absolute basis a net debt to EBTIDAre of 35x is considered very safe providing ample debt capacity to fund accretive transactions and  or redevelopment activitiesAn additional major aspect in the context of MAAs debt capacity and financing structure which has to be factored in is the relatively extended debt maturity profile in conjunction with 100 fixed rate financingThis means that MAA is protected from materially higher financing costs imposing a significant and concentrated effect on the FFO generation  provided that MAA does not assume incremental external financing in a major fashion only 9 of the total debt is set to reprice towards market level interest rates on an annual basis Given MAAs ability to deliver a positive likeforlike growth in NOI and fund new projects through internal cash generation these gradual effects from higher interest rates should be easily offset with improved cash flowsLastly MAA possesses a great degree of flexibility to cover notable investments or obtain an optimal financing source to refinance the maturing borrowing As of Q2 2023 MAA had over 125 billion available under the existing credit facility which is more than enough to refinance all of the incoming debt maturities until 2026As elaborated above the sector in which MAA operates is robust and with favourable growth prospects Historically MAA has managed to capitalize on these dynamics by registering relatively stronger FFO growth results compared to the peersIn fact MAA has avoided negative rate of change movement in its annual FFO during 2020 and 2021 while the sector on average suffered from higher vacancy rates and temporarily reduced rents due to the COVID19 shockA major driver of the resilient performance has been both internal and external growth opportunities funded by primarily internal cash generationOn average MAA retains 40 of the generated FFO This allows the Management to cover CapEx and  or accretive MA deals without a heavy reliance on external leverage In the context of prevailing financing costs this strategy clearly bears fruit allowing MAA to act opportunistically while there is an increasing pressure for more indebted competitors to optimize their balance sheets via among other divestituresIn my opinion MAA is great real estate investment for investors who seek stability and protection amid the looming recessionary risks and potential consequences from higherforlonger scenario in the real estate marketCurrently MAA yields 4 which is not that attractive but considering the growth potential and the resiliency of underlying business operations the investment case looks attractiveThe investment case of MAA should play out when the market becomes more depressed causing the property cap rates to go up materially Under such conditions MAA should be able to utilize its balance sheet capacity and internal cash generation to accommodate profitable deals in a sizeable fashion   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being

355,State Of The (Energy) Union,Over the last couple weeks I have had several discussions on investments energy and broader financial markets with friends I enjoy these discussions but I also have a tendency to ramble from one topic to the next Part of this is justI think it takes one look at the chart above to realize that we are never going to have an electricEven if you want to ignore the unusual number of whales washing up onshore on the East Coast or the  by wind turbines all it takes is a little bit of research into wind turbines and solar panels to realize just how ineffective it is for power generation If you want a couple headlines that show some of the flaws in renewables here are a couple worth reading The  covers the renewable projects that are already looking for rate increases despite subsidies The  is a headline on Britains offshore wind market going nobid for the first time Could the technology improve dramatically in the future Maybe Im skeptical but the current calculations could change For now solar and wind are not viable to produce reliable base load power in my viewOne of the other things people ignore is what it takes to create wind and solar panels Now we get to take a short detour into the coal industry which is responsible for more than two thirds of global steel production Not only do solar and wind have much less bang for the buck as far as energy produced but it takes a lot of steel and by extension coal to produceOver the last couple years of obsessively following financial markets I have learned a lot about the energy sector The whole energy sector is more cyclical than your average business but that means there is potential for outsized returns if you catch the wave right I think that we have a bull market in front of us for most commodities due to the lack of investment over the last decadeIn the past I have talked about the cyclical nature of the world and financial markets I talked about different assets near the peak financial market themes like ESG also being near the peak while commodities and other assets that are out of favor are closer to the trough of the cycle One of the books I read last year was Capital Returns by Edward Chancellor which talks about the capital cycle and investment returnsFor me the lack of investment is most obvious in several sectors primarily coal uranium and offshore oil rigs Its most commodities but I think the bull case for these three sectors in particular is relatively simple to understandIf you look at the capital cycle picture above like a clock I think we are still around 800 We still arent seeing new investment in the sector the valuations are still extremely cheap and companies are buying back stock like crazy at these low valuations My assumption is that we will also see coal prices head higher in the next couple years but that will just be gravy in my opinion Coal demand is still growing and some of the best coal assets have 20 to 30 year lives Im curious to see what happens to signal the end of this coal cycle but I dont think we are anywhere close to the top of the cycle for the sectorIm wishing I had bought some Alpha Metallurgical Resources  instead of just sticking with Peabody Energy  but its only a matter of time until we see something closer to fair value with stocks across the coal sector AMR has reduced shares outstanding by more than 25 since the start of their buyback program a year and a half ago and Peabody just bought back more than 8 of their stock in one quarter You can argue that most of the coal sector would still be cheap if share prices doubled from here as they would still have single digit PE ratios at current coal prices AMR and Peabody arent the only companies in the sector with huge capital return programs but are just two examples that I think will be trading much higher in the next couple yearsWhile I dont think we are near the peak of the coal cycle I think we are only in the third or fourth inning of the offshore cycle The offshore oil investment cycle is very long compared to conventional or shale oil and I think we will be smack dab in the middle of a huge bull market for offshore oil companies in a couple years The super bull case for offshore is 1000000 day rates for high spec rigs which I believe means we could potentially see at least a double on stocks like Transocean  Valaris  and Noble Corporation  Tidewater  will be along for the ride as OSV day rates follow alongThe capital cycle for offshore looks like we are running into a situation with a huge mismatch on supply and demand for rigs and I think we will go way past the last cycle peak with day rates above 600000 Im hoping that it runs to 1000000 per day or higher but we will have to wait and see on that I have written about the offshore sector in the past going into more detail about what will lead to new builds how long it will take but Im still very bullish on the sector even after a huge run to start the yearThe offshore cycle is long and slow compared to shale which can ramp production quickly Many projects are 510 year investments and require huge upfront spending While that was disastrous for offshore companies in the last downturn we are at the beginning of the bull cycle for the sector in my opinion and I think we see higher day rates than the last cycle peak I dont know if it takes three years or five years but I think companies like Transocean Valaris Noble and Tidewater will all provide attractive returns for investors despite the fact that they have been massive outperformers coming off the bottom a couple years ago On the producer side I am bullish on most of the oil sector but I chose to own the South American producers like Petrobras   and Ecopetrol  for their dirt cheap valuations and huge dividendsLike offshore oil the cycle for uranium is a very long cycle The last peak was in 2007 and like offshore day rates I think we will eventually exceed the last cycle peak which was over 130 per pound The price to produce uranium has been higher than the price of the commodity for years and I think we are going to overshoot on the other direction at some point in the next couple years I have seen predictions that we are on our way to 100 per pound I think we will probably go higher than that a couple years from now but we will just have to wait and seeMoving back to the energy density side shows that nuclear is the only real solution that makes sense for baseload power To generate one gigawatt of electricity shows the difference between nuclear which also has no carbon emissions and solar and wind You can fit a nuclear reactor on one square mile of land while you would need 431 wind turbines or 31 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power The technology for nuclear power has also been improving and I keep hearing about molten salt thorium reactors which sounds like the next logical stepYou might be asking well what about the  You would be better off asking about what happens to  and wind turbines and their waste that ends up in landfills The nuclear waste issue is actually not a problem when you look at it objectivelyOur push for wind solar and electric vehicles is going to have consequences Its only a matter of time I wasnt able to cover EVs today but that push is just as misguided as solar and wind in my mind Im fine with readers that disagree but just take some time to look at a lithium mine cobalt mine or nickel mine All of these are powered by diesel excavators and the commodity bottlenecks are going to cause problems if we continue to go down this path I think we are going to be driving internal combustion engines for decades to come and we simply dont have the commodity production to put enough batteries in carsAs a society we should be focused on building nuclear plants for base load power pipelines to transport natural gas to places like California and the Northeast and investing in oil production because all of these things will lead to cheaper energy and higher standards of living The energy density and energy return on energy invested should be the main considerations for future investments in energy One of the things that has become obvious to me over the last couple years is that there is no such thing as a low energy rich country We take our standard of living for granted but maybe we shouldnt If our leaders continue to make and incentivize poor investments in energy I believe it will eventually come back to bite usAs an investor Im focused on learning as much as I can about the way the world works I like to say that if you want to find out the way the world really works follow the money If you want to make money as investor you should try to figure out where big money is going over the next 13 years In the last couple years that approach has led me to the commodity sector I think we are in the early stages of a broad commodity bull market and Im even more bullish on the coal sector offshore oil and uranium I think the capital cycle shows that we still have a long way to go with all three and I think the moves for each sector could be explosive   Past performance

356,Centrus Energy: The Most Distinct Energy Company At Great Price,Centrus Energy  is one of the most distinct companies in the uranium industry They are the only producer of lowenriched uranium in the USA Their balance sheet is alarming at first glance because itUranium offers an exceptional asymmetric investment opportunity Its growing deficit caused by stagnating supply and increasing demand heralds the new bull market Unlike commodities such as copper and oil uranium is not dependent on the economic cycle Geopolitics drives its price more and applies with even greater force today The coup in Niger the country that supplies 7 of the worlds annual production affirms that fact Europe relies heavilyIll summarize in a few points why were at the beginning of an epic bull market in uranium Lack of investment in discoveries and new mines combined with politicaleconomic fragmentation significantly impacts supply Even without direct sanctions many countries have begun to supply uranium from other sources but RussiaOn the other hand we observe rising demand due to nuclear power revival The latter has become widely accepted as an alternative to fossil fuels making it an essential element of the transition to zero carbon emissions And it is not only that the population of India and much of Africa is growing exponentially Increasing capacity is the only way to meet the rising peoples energy needs In addition India is climbing up the S curve of GDP in which fewer people live in desperate poverty and more are entering the  It is projected that the Indian middle class will grow by 65  by 2030 The chart below illustrates the Indian income pyramidThat means they will demand more stuff and its production needs everincreasing energy The answer to the rising demand is nuclear power Another crucial point is energy independence World fragmentation is the driver behind it An increasing number of countries plan to  for all the reasons listed  the Green Deal demographics and energy independenceA potential accelerator  sanctions against Russian uranium The imbalance between supply and demand is a fact It will slowly and steadily impact uranium prices If sanctions are imposed on Russian uranium the process described above will accelerate multifold and the uranium shortage will reach epic proportionsThat is not healthy for any market The commodity CAPEX cycle creates imbalances between demand and supply which are cured by the market dynamics Epic deficits caused by exogenous shocks negatively impact the industry longterm even if we as investors can cash significant returns We can profit handsomely in a normal CAPEX cycle without systematic shocks and the uranium market is such an opportunityCentrus business is at least to say obscure To make my thesis more comprehensive I will briefly present the fuel nuclear cycleIn nature uranium occurs in the form of 6 isotopes The two primary ones are U235 and U238 In nuclear energy and for defense purposes U235 is of leading importance U238 produces plutonium for nuclear triad intercontinental ballistic missiles strategic bombers and nuclear submarinesUranium 238 U238 makes up over 99 of the uranium found in nature The remaining less than one percent includes all other isotopes Among these is Uranium 235 U235 which has the most comprehensive application in energy The path of uranium from the mine to nuclear reactors and warheads is long and complexI will give a glossary of terms that you will encounter later in the reportThis is what the  looks like from the mine through the nuclear reactor to the radioactive waste dumpWe as investors can get involved mainly in the first two steps of the chart At the following stages of production only a few public companies are involved and Centrus Energy is one of those companiesCentrus Energy is wellpositioned to benefit from the new uranium bull market The companys business has two segments The image below from Centrus  financial report illustrates revenues by segment88  of the revenue comes from SWU and uranium sales That segment supplies various components for producing nuclear fuel 12  of the revenue comes from the technical solutions segment responsible for designing constructing and manufacturing uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel fabrication systemsGeographically the companys customers are utility companies in the US The chart below illustrates the revenue by countryThe primary market is the USA with 91  revenuesCarbonneutral energy requires a transition to a new generation of energy sources Nuclear power is among them In recent years new reactors have been developed to cement nuclear powers place as the best solution These reactors will operate with HALEU instead of those working with LEUThe higher concentration of U235 will enhance the reactors performance The goal is to achieve all three simplified design easier servicing and increased safety However the limitation to their widespread adoption is the availability of a HALEU production facility Centrus has a unique position recognized by the Department of Energy and the Gates Foundation On 17 July the company a memorandum of understanding with Terra Power company for developing small modular reactors backed by the Gates Foundation On 22 November 2022 DoE awarded Centrus a 150milliondollar contract to complete the construction and production of HALEU in the Piketon Ohio facility More detail about the grant from DoD is shown in the image belowThe projected demand for HALEU will increase due to the introduction and adoption of SMRs The chart below from  illustrates thatBeing among the few producers of HALEU gives Centrus an exceptional moat On top of that it could not be duplicated due to business peculiarities and its importance for national security Running Centrus business requires highly skilled professionals in particular areas  from legal consultants and lobbyists to mathematicians and nuclear engineers Obtaining permits and following the regulations to operate nuclearrelated enterprises is another unbearable endeavorTo begin with Centrus Energy has negative equity due to accumulated losses of 214 million in past years At the same time their longterm debt is 182 million and cash is 212 million so the company has access to liquidity Centrus has uranium inventories valued at 288 million too Despite accumulated losses and negative equity the company is liquidData source Seeking Alpha Centrus company profileCentrus has proven its ability to generate free cash flow during difficult times The below chart from the companys profile illustrates thatThe company has a significantly higher 5Y average FCF margin than the energy sector median and the companys 5Y average Another positive sign is strong Gross and Net Income margins higher than the companys 5Y average Higher uranium prices will expand the margins and positively affect Centruss bottom lineCEO is Daniel Poneman He has been in this role since 2015 His appointment coincides with the brutal bear market that lasted until 2021 when it bottomed out Poneman has proven to be a strong leader by successfully surviving this crisis He has skin in the game too He owns 35 million worth of stock 062 of the company Chairman Mikel H Williams was newly appointed to the position this year It has 24 million in sharesThe CEO successfully navigated the tough postFukushima bear market In recent years he negotiated contracts with TENEX and Orano to buy SWU at prices well below todays Skin in the game is also presentUnlike Cameco where the usual suspects have invested  funds with exposure to energy and mining the situation is different at Centrus Global X and Vanguard are still in play However two names stand out One is a director on the companys boardNeil Subin has been an independent director since 2017 He is a partner and manager of Broadbill Investment Partners a boutique fund investing in deepvalue and distressed businesses The most significant exposure in their portfolio is Centrus  about 60 These stocks represent 332 of Centers The other name that owns 121 of the stock is Morris Bawabeh There is no information about him It is only indicated that he is related to Kulayba LLCI value companies in the resource extraction sector by net asset value but Centrus is a company in its own game Companies producing nuclear fuel exist but they are not public This makes comparing where Centrus its peers an impossible task In that case I chose the 2 Stage Discounted Free Cash Flow Model

USenriched uranium imports come from Russia and its allies Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Ban on Russian enriched uranium imports will cause an extreme deficit of LEU The chart below from Centrus last presentation shows the degree of dependency on Russian uranium importsFor Centrus the most significant risk is the contract with TENEX This Russian stateowned corporation produces components for

357,The Bullish Case For Oil Is Still Compelling,Not since November of last year have we seen oil prices where they are today We are close by far to the highest pricing that crude has traded at all year As of this writing WTI crude for instance is at 9118 per barrel Not surprisingly Brent crude isThe last article that I published that covered the oil market generally came out in early April of this year At that time I was talking about the new OPEC production cut and how that represented a massive gift to the oil sector Normally when I talk about investing I like to identify individual companies that should rise or fall materially But when it comes to the oil patch there are many different types of companies to choose from with each one having a significantly different risk vs reward payoff compared to the others For some investors it just makes it easier to buy into an ETF that appreciates if oil prices rise or drops if they fallBack then the ETF I chose as the primary emphasis for my article was   But there are plenty of others to choose from each one with its own positives and negatives Examples include           and   To be clear investors would be wise to evaluate each of these ETFs individually to see which one best fits their own investment preferences and risk appetite But in general one thing that these all should have in common is that as oil prices rise they should appreciate This should be true at least in the short termRegardless of the vehicle that each individual investor chooses to play in the oil market a case could be made by some that prices are too high and should drop from here Theres certainly data to support that view Take data provided by the EIA for instance In its most recent ShortTerm Energy Outlook which was published earlier this month the agency calculated that for 2023 global oil supply would come in at about 10118 million barrels per day This would be about 021 million barrels per day higher than the 10097 million in consumption that would be experienced This disparity might not seem like much to some investors But it could have a major impact on global oil markets if true The total excess supply spread over a single year would be 7665 million barrelsNow its important to point out that just because inventories are rising that this shouldnt necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on oil It all depends on how much crude already is out there Generally the range that should be considered healthy for the environment would be between 55 and 60 days worth of supply of crude in OECD nations Whenever this number starts ticking above 60 we start to drift into bearish territory Based on the STEO report issued by the end of this year we should be at roughly 6057 days worth of supply for OECD nations That would translate to excess crude amongst developed nations of 26 million barrels To make matters worse the 2024 calendar year should see global demand of 10288 million barrels per day Thats 055 million barrels per day higher than the 10233 million barrels per day of consumption that has been forecasted That would translate to 20075 million barrels of additional crude throughout the year with OECD inventories climbing to 284 billion barrels or 6214 daysLooking at the most recently available weekly  we see that domestic crude inventories for the US excluding whats in the SPR Strategic Petroleum Reserve are about 127 billion barrels Thats an increase over the 123 billion barrels of crude seen one year earlier However if we include the SPR into the picture domestic inventories would have declined from 165 billion barrels to 162 billion This is because in order to combat high oil prices the US has drained a lot of the oil in the SPR taking inventories from 4226 million barrels last year to 351 million this yearSo to summarize what we have on the bearish side of the equation is the EIA forecasting continued growth in production that exceeds consumption We have evidence in the form of existing inventories of the picture looking worse than it did last year if we ignore the SPR Although not mentioned previously oil production also is the highest that it has been in more than two years with output averaging 1290 million barrels per day here at home And you also have high pricing that in theory should attract more drillers that would in turn cause even more supply to come onto the marketAll of this is fine but there are some issues with the data from what I can see For starters while this is not necessarily an issue the timing for oil prices to climb looks right Even though the EIA has forecasted excess supply on a global scale for this year in its entirety the current quarter that we are in which is the third quarter should actually see demand outpace supply to the tune of 058 million barrels per day And in the fourth quarter we should see demand outpace supply by 023 million barrels per day All combined this should cause global inventories to drop by 745 million barrels between the start of the third quarter and the end of this yearBut when you dig into the actual data provided by the EIA you end up with issues as well For starters the agency has Russia producing 1057 million barrels of crude per day in the second quarter and 1048 million barrels per day in the third quarter For 2023 as a whole the estimate is 1064 million barrels per day However Russia has significantly reduced its own output SP for instance recently estimated that through 2024 the country should only be producing between 94 million and 95 million barrels of crude each day OPEC however sees Russia dropping production from 1085 million barrels per day in the second quarter of this year to only 1022 million barrels per day in the third quarter This year as a whole were looking at about 1045 million barrels per day which would be about 694 million barrels of crude in the aggregate lower than what the EIA data suggestsThere are some other minor differences on the supply side But the bigger differences involve demand As an example OPEC believes that global oil demand this year will average about 10206 million barrels per day Thats 109 million barrels per day higher than what the EIA forecasted For the third quarter of this year OPEC believes that its own production would need to be roughly 2923 million barrels per day in order to match demand But if we take data provided by the group for the first two months of the third quarter were looking at an average of 2739 million barrels per day That translates to a deficit of 204 million barrels per day That deficit is likely to grow to 332 million barrels per day in the final quarter of this year if OPEC production averages the same amount during that time And with Saudi Arabia having just reaffirmed its target of keeping production lower by 1 million barrels per day through the rest of this year that deficit is looking likelyIf these estimates turn out to be accurate and if the historical data reported by OPEC for the first and second quarters of this year are correct then we would be looking at an aggregate deficit of oil this year of 4761 million barrels While nobody knows what the future holds the organization does think that global demand in 2024 will average 10431 million barrels per day And even with nonOPEC output slated to rise by 145 million barrels per day from 2023 to 2024 the group would need to put out 3002 million barrels per day next year in order to avoid further shortfallsAs I mentioned earlier in this article US production is higher than it has been in years That trend also is looking set to continue However it could take quite a while before US output rises enough to bring prices down For starters as of August of this year which is the most recent month for which we have  available there were only 4749 DUC wells across the major basins This is actually down from the 5191 reported one year earlier To put this in perspective in August of 2019 which was right before the COVID19 pandemic DUC wells numbered 8156 The count of wells is often seen as the count of spots from which oil companies can realistically extract crude in a fairly short window of time Thats because a sizable portion of the cost of extracting oil comes from the drilling process So when drilling is already done but the entire well is not completed it can be viewed as a mechanism to quickly ramp up output But to see the DUC well count fall so low indicates that this potential is limited In fact the most recent Drilling Productivity Report issued by the EIA even indicated that production across the major basins should fall collectively by 40000 barrels per day from September to OctoberAt this point in time I would say that investors probably have more reasons to be bullish on crude than they have reasons to be bearish Yes there are certain economic uncertainties and those could play a big role in what happens to pricing from this point on But absent a major downturn in the economy the existing balance between supply and demand in crude will have a much larger role in determining what happens with prices Even though data provided by the EIA is showing a rather bearish situation the OPEC data indicates otherwise and the market from a pricing perspective clearly is on its side While some may argue that OPEC is not the most reliable source out there my experience and looking at its data is that it tends to be quite accurate And when you combine that with a lower DUC count lower production moving forward in major basins higher pricing in the market and lower domestic inventories if we include the SPR I would argue that the bullish case moving forward is definitely more compellingCrude Value Insights is a service geared toward

359,Exxon Mobil: Likely Higher For Longer,The only time I    was on December 22 2023 when the stock was trading at 1079 and many investment banks began to revise their forecasts for the stocks future growth potential AtThe balance of supply and demand in the oil market was predicted approximately correctly by most experts and XOM stock ultimately proved to be the beneficiary gaining 106 since the publication of my bullish articleAs XOMs share priceExxon Mobil  a significant drop in its 2Q23 earnings with adjusted net profit at 7874 billion 194 per share down from 17551 billion 414 per share in the prior year Lower crude oil and natural gas prices weaker refining margins and increased capital spending contributed to the decline The firms revenue decreased by 27 to 80795 billion the income from equity affiliates and other income are excluded so it also missed the markets expectationsIn April 2022 the company restructured forming Exxon Mobil Product Solutions and centralizing certain groups It now reports results in 4 segments Upstream Energy Products Chemical Products and Specialty ProductsThe Upstream segments profit fell to 4577 billion due to lower commodity prices and reduced oilequivalent production US Upstream profit dropped to 920 million while nonUS Upstream earnings declined to 3657 billion The Energy Products segments profit decreased to 2310 billion primarily due to lower refining margins Chemical Products reported a profit of 828 million reflecting weaker industry conditions In Specialty Products profit improved to 671 million driven by higher pricingCapital and exploration expenses rose to 6166 billion Exxon Mobil aims to invest in promising projects strengthen its balance sheet and maintain a sustainable dividend with an expected 2023 CAPEX between 2325 billionOil prices got a boost as Saudi Arabia and Russia  voluntary production cuts until yearend tightening the market Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in their recent note September 20 2023  proprietary source that Brent Crude exceeding 100 per barrel seems stretched despite strong signals of market tightness such as rising prices robust demand and falling inventories The market is currently undersupplied by about 1 million barrels per day mainly due to OPECs 1 mbd cut led by Saudi Arabia The analysts expect that Saudi Arabia will maintain its cuts well into FY2024 keeping the market tight until at least early 2024 However significant price increases are unlikely with Brent expected to range between 85 to 95 per barrel by the end of 2024So based on the tight market situation until early 2024 XOM has an excellent background for its operational activities which should become even more efficient in the foreseeable futureAs another group of Morgan Stanleys analysts wrote a few days ago proprietary source the company aims to triple its earnings by FY2027 compared to FY2019 mainly thanks to strategic projects XOM sets records for oil production in the Permian and achieved record production rates in Guyana They also completed a significant chemical expansion project in the Gulf Coast Exxon Mobil anticipates bringing on 2 new projects in the second half of the year Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana further enhancing earnings potentialAfter opportunistically rationalizing and divesting lowermargin refineries over the past few years Exxon Mobils Energy Products portfolio is now 85 integrated with its chemical facilities In the long term Exxon Mobil has positioned itself well to take advantage of opportunities in product reconfiguration particularly in the biofuels lubricants and chemicals sectors as the energy transition continues to evolveAt the same time we see that the valuation of the company currently looks quite modest The market sees EVEBITDA for next year at the 67x level although the EBITDA margin TTM by quarter is currently 215 which is 57 basis points higher than last year for the same period From a historical perspective in terms of EVEBITDA multiples XOM is valued at the low end of the norm but has a very strong FCF that is likely to be even higher due to higher oil prices and is currently over 10 of market cap indicating serious undervaluationIn recent weeks refining margins have improved due to low clean product inventories strong demand facility outages and geopolitical uncertainties such as reduced Russian exports Exxon Mobil with its global refining capacity of about 45 million barrels per day is expected to benefit significantly from these higher margins Based on current price expectations there is a 7 potential upside to Energy Products downstream consensus earnings in the second half of 2023 and a 15 upside to 2024 previous estimates Morgan Stanley analysts addedLets do the math together If the above forecasts come true or if actual earnings are close to these levels then at 75x of EVEBITDA we should get a market cap of 533 billion after adjusting for net debt Then the upside potential from the current price would be 1438 excluding  FWD The expected total return exceeds 15 so I reiterate my previous buy recommendationI should mention that Exxon faces several significant risk factors in its operations so everyone should be cautious when buying its stockFirst the company operates in a commoditydriven industry where it has limited control over the prices of its products This vulnerability to fluctuating commodity prices can impact its profitability and financial performance as was the case throughout its entire historySecond Exxon is engaged in major capital projects and cost overruns on these projects can pose financial challenges These overruns can strain the companys financial resources and potentially affect its ability to meet its investment goals and deliver expected returns to shareholdersAdditionally geopolitical risks are a concern for Exxon Operating in countries with a history of corruption and political instability can expose the company to uncertainties that may impact production volumes and returns However Exxons global presence helps mitigate some of these risks by diversifying its operations across different regionsDespite many obvious risks Exxon Mobil stock is a Buy today even at the high end of its multiweek price range becausea the oil market is still tightb refining margins are improvingc management is taking some strategically sound steps to improve the companys operational efficiency andd the stock is quite cheap given the strong FCF levelsAs a result I expect XOM to be higher for longer  at least until

361,Plains GP Holdings: Healthy Financials Coupled With Upside Growth Potentials,Plains GP Holdings  is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership since the end of  the companys cash flow has been completely derived from an indirect investment in Plain All American Pipeline Plains All American has a prominent position and infrastructure in the Permian Basin which is the most important basin in North America As theFigure 1As mentioned earlier a solid balance sheet and capital structure is one of the strong elements of Plains The company was successful in increasing its cash generation during the last year It reached a cash balance of 983 million in  versus only 327 million in 2Q 2022 Higher cash generation improved their balance sheet by declining their net debt to 72 billion in 2Q 2023 year over year compared with 86 million in the same time in 2022 Thankfully their equity level of 148 billion is far higher than the net debt which offsets the risks of future debt and equity financing see Figure 2Figure 2  PAGPs capital structure in millionsFurthermore the solid cash structure of Plains is another element that makes the company prominent After a deep drop in their operating cash flow from 941 million in 3Q 2022 to 334 million at the end of 2022 they increased their cash flow from operations and reached 887 million at the end of 2Q 2023 Thankfully their capital spending remained at a reasonable level of 159 million thereby leading to an ample amount of 728 million of free cash flow at the end of the recent quarter Except for 3Q 2022 their generated free cash flow hit the highest amount in the previous quarters In the recent quarter the management declared a 02675 dividend per share which accounts for approximately 525 million of dividend payments based on 196000000 outstanding shares According to their large amount of FCF there is room for both deleveraging and higher shareholder distributions in the future see Figure 3Figure 3  PAGPs cash structure in millionsThe management predicted to keep their leverage level at lower than 35x by the end of 2023 After analyzing their healthy cash and capital structures in the previous quarters it goes with no surprise to see that their guidance is easily reachable The wake of the COVID19 outbreak and the downturn of 2020 caused leverage ratios of Plains to surge over 7x however the company enhanced its leverage condition considerably through successful deleveraging in the last couple of years Ultimately Plains net debttoEBITDA ratio is 28x in TTM and its net debttoCFO ratio is 25x in TTM see Figure 4Improved financial flexibility paves the way for higher cash returns to investors and allows the management to consider a new capital allocation framework The management  to increase its cash distribution by 015 per share per year and this increase will continue until its unit distribution coverage ratio reaches approximately 160 Their guidance for their unit distribution coverage ratio by the end of 2023 is 215 which shows that the company has plenty of room to grow and its unit price therefore has an upside potential to riseFigure 4  PAGPs leverage conditionIt is worth noting that the companys healthy liquidity condition coupled with strong coverage conditions eliminates risks of probable economic recessions to a great extent During the recent quarters the company improved its liquidity condition across the board of current and cash ratios The companys current assets are well enough to pay back its shortterm obligations with a current ratio of 10x In addition their cash ratio became twofold to 02x in 2Q 2023 versus 01x at the end of the first quarter which indicates the company is capable of paying circa 20 of its obligations only with its generated cash which is attractive see Figure 5Figure 5  PAGPs liquidity conditionThe first and foremost risk associated with Plains operations and profitability is related to any major or minor changes in supply and demand for crude oil natural gas NLG and other services that PAA provides Shortages in supply and demand which can be caused by a variety of factors that are not under the managements control may adversely affect their operations and financial condition Also the managements prediction for 2023 WTI crude oil is 825bbl on average If oil prices drop more other projections and operations may adversely become affected It is important to mention that Plains distributes all of its available cash thus its growth process may be slower than businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand their operationsPlains is a stable and wellperforming business in the oil and gas industry it is one of the most prominent midstream companies in North America The companys operation and financial results have been on the same path as the managements guidance which shows their stability for more growth in the future The management plans to increase its cash distribution by 015 per share yearly until its unit distribution coverage ratio reaches approximately 160 Based on this years 215 we can say that the company has plenty of room to grow and its unit price thereby has a good potential to rise Furthermore the healthy cash and capital structures of Plains resulted in strong leverage and liquidity conditions that eliminate risks of further financial and economic constraints in the future

that many wouldbe homebuyers will have to remain renters until homeownership becomes more affordable This is great news for multifamily landlords like MAA because a renttoincome ratio of 22 is far more affordable than the alternative of buying a home right nowAnother competitive advantage for MAA is its robust development and redevelopment platform which was significantly bolstered by its  of

development projectsThis development arm in addition to MAAs redevelopment platform that constantly upgrades a portion of its apartments with the latest technologies and interior designs keeps the portfolio fresh and in tune with renter preferencesWhats more MAA is able to deliver internally developed properties at stabilized yields of 67 or higher For development projects currently in the leaseup phase MAA expects to generate a stabilized NOI yield of 72 This is a massive strength at a time when multifamily cap rates are in the 45 territoryThe above investment approach has worked extraordinarily well for MAA over the last few decades We see it in the numbers Compare for example MAAs Q2 core FFO per share and samestore NOI growth to that of its peersUses AFFO instead of core FFOUses NFFO instead of core FFOGranted this is only one quarter But if you zoom out further youll find more evidence of MAAs outperformance over its peersQuality isnt always easy to describe but it does tend to be quantifiable in performance numbers That is certainly the case for MAAThe market seems to think that Sunbelt multifamily REITs time in the sun has come to an end The period of very lowinterest rates from the second half of 2020 through early 2022 spurred a surge in new development starts in the multifamily space focused on the areas where people were moving during the pandemic This includes the suburban areas of coastal cities and pretty much everywhere across the SunbeltNotice in the chart below how multifamily construction starts averaged about 500000 in 2022 compared to an average of under 400000 during the 2010sA large share of these new apartments are going to be delivered in MAAs Sunbelt marketsThe market seems to think these new units will compete directly with MAAs existing portfolio which is not necessarily the case MAA enjoys at least two competitive advantages amid this wave of new supplyYou can see both competitive advantages displayed in the illustration belowFirst in many of MAAs markets the submarkets where the REITs properties are located are expected to receive only a fraction of the total supply coming to those cities MAAs communities often enjoy superior locations that offer greater convenience in terms of proximity to highways shopping centers and workplacesSecond MAAs existing portfolio is able to offer rent rates significantly below the asking rents of these newly delivered apartments Everyone knows that construction costs have gone up a lot in the last few years Plus developers typically have highinterest rate construction loans in place That in addition to the desire to sell the stabilized property for top dollar requires them to seek out the highest possible rent ratesThus the primary competitors of newly delivered apartments tend not to be existing apartments but rather  These new apartment communities will likely have to offer concessions such as one or a few months of free rent in order to get leases signed at these higher rent rates But in most cases it is unlikely that they will drop rents low enough to compete with MAAs existing apartment stockPlus notice in the chart above that both construction starts and building permits for multifamily properties have dropped significantly below their 2022 levels Highinterest rates have caused starts to plummet This means that the wave of new supply will be severely curtailed starting sometime in 2025The supply headwind is temporaryIn the long run I would worry more about the supply pressures urban apartment landlords in coastal cities will face from officetomultifamily conversions Cities like New York City San Francisco Los Angeles and Chicago with lots of old halfempty office buildings and local governments that are desperate to revitalize their downtown areas and therefore likely to subsidize conversion projects are more likely to face a secular trend of apartment supply growth than the SunbeltAccording to a recent  put out by researchers at New York University and Columbia Business School the top five metro areas with the most potential officetomultifamily conversions were you guessed itDue to greater office utilization and less public transportation the Sunbelt is at a much lower risk of apartment supply growth from office conversions in the long runMAA has among the strongest balance sheets if not  strongest in its multifamily REIT peer group It is not the only multifamily REIT with credit ratings of AA3but it is the only REIT with 100 fixedrate debt and net debt to EBITDA as low as 34xBut net debt to EBITDA is only one metric to measure balance sheet strength There are others and they all show MAA wellpositioned compared to peersMAA stacks up well against its peer group average in terms of debt to assets unencumbered assets debt service coverage and weighted average debt maturityNotice the small highlighted section showing that the peer group constituents include AVB CPT EQR Essex Property Trust  and UDR Inc  In other words MAA is only comparing itself to the largest and strongest multifamily REITs not any of the smaller ones with weaker balance sheetsThe REIT does have a steady slate of debt maturities to refinance in the coming years That is perhaps the weakest aspect of the balance sheet Even if the bond market is favorable to MAA the REIT will likely have to roll over these loans at new interest rates at least 200 basis points above the weighted average interest rate of 34 based on the current average effective bond yield for corporates with an A ratingThe good news is that MAA has plenty of liquidity as well as significant retained cash from its low payout ratio This should help it blunt the blow of refinancing at higher ratesCertainly up until now MAA has managed to avoid rising interest expenses Just the opposite has been the case MAAs interest expense has  since 2019 ie the trailing twelvemonth period ending at the beginning of 2020Perhaps the only reason why EQRs interest expense has fallen more than MAAs is that EQR has been a net seller of assets in order to deleverage Notice in the chart below that while MAAs total assets have crept up since the beginning of 2020 EQRs total assets have declined by about 5EQR sold properties in order to reduce its debt load while MAA has  needed to sell properties to reduce its debtAs more supply comes online and developers get desperate to offload properties amid highinterest rates MAAs management believes that they will soon be able to utilize their significant dry powder 125 billion capacity on the credit facility plus 150 million in cash to scoop up attractively valued acquisitionsMAA is bestinclass in the multifamily REIT space because of itsThis explains why it is my largest multifamily REIT holding and why I view it as a phenomenal buying opportunity right nowThere will be mild to moderate headwinds in the short term from supply deliveries and debt refinancing but MAA will be able to navigate these slight headwinds far easier than the market seems to thinkWhat the market seems to ignore is  the Sunbelt is growing and wouldbe homebuyers are largely stuck in the rental market for the

363,KNOT Offshore Partners: Main Concerns Regarding Leverage And Liquidity,KNOT Offshore Partners LP  is operating and acquiring vessels to pursue its business in the shuttle tanker segment In other words a shuttle tanker is a floating pipeline that operates under a period charter and is based onOne of my main concerns about the Partnership was related to their upcoming debt maturities during 2023 which totaled around 372 million because this amount was much higher than their operating cash flow Thankfully during the recent quarter the management  that they fixed credit approval for the 320 millionGoing forward through 2023 KNOPs debt refinancing will remain on my watch list For instance they will announce the result of a discussion with their lenders regarding the two 25 million unsecured revolving credit facilities with maturity dates of August and November 2023 Moreover their new contracts developments regarding new threeyear time charter contracts for the Fortaleza Knutsen and the Recife Knutsen with Transpetro lower their risk of losing their total assetsNotwithstanding the boom in oil prices during 2022 it seems that KNOP Partnership could not take appropriate advantage of high energy prices to improve its financial results In other words my main concern about the Partnership is associated with their debt levels which is of great importance to be cared for Albeit their net debt level declined slightly to circa 986 million by the end of  versus 1011 billion at the end of 2022 their net debt level is still higher than the equity amount During the last year the Partners equity levels were almost constant finally sitting at 648 million by the end of the first quarter of 2023 Additionally KNOP could increase its cash generation slightly to 52 million in 1Q 2023 versus 476 million and 41 million at the end of 4Q 2022 and 1Q 2022 respectively see Figure 1Analyzing their cash structure indicates that during the first quarter of 2023 the Partnerships cash from operations reached over 29 million versus 21 million and 18 million at the end of 4Q and 1Q 2022 respectively Meanwhile despite favorable energy prices during the last year and the end of the downturn of 2020 the Partnerships charter contracts ended in tandem with several vessels dry docking Being dry docked for vessels is the same as auto repairing for vehicles on the land Thus routinely maintaining and repairing their vessels increased their costs As a result the Partnerships capital expenditures surged to 14 million at the end of the recent quarter versus only 05 million at the end of 2022 and 02 million in the first quarter of 2022 When all was said and done approximately 28 million is left as a free cash flow for the Partnership to finance its distributions Moreover KNOP Partnership  a 0026 dividend payment per share for the second quarter of 2023 which was paid a few days ago on August 10th 2023 which was the same as the fourth quarter of 2022 after the management decided to cut their quarterly dividends by 95 Consequently their cash inflows should outpace their cash outflows because the number of their common number of outstanding shares was 34900000 Their dividend payment thereby was less than 1 million for the second quarter of 2023 see Figure 2Investigating the Partnerships leverage condition across the board of net debttoEBITDA and net debttoCFO indicates the importance of declining debt levels As it is indicated in Figure 3 Although KNOPs net debttoEBITDA ratio declined from over 26x at the end of 2022 to 22x in 1Q 2023 it is still very high Moreover their net debttooperating cash flow is even worse at 33x while it was at 49x year over year compared with 1Q 2022 Their leverage condition is particularly concerning and hopefully the management reduce net debt levels and thus their leverage should be at a decent paceBesides leverage ratios you can see that the Partnerships liquidity condition is at high risk After analyzing the Partnerships cash and capital structures it is not too surprising to receive warnings from their current and cash ratios of 022x and 013x respectively at the end of the first quarter of 2023 Notwithstanding not changing considerably from the fourth quarter of 2022 both liquidity ratios dropped considerably year over year as versus 1Q 2022 The partnerships current ratio was 056x and its cash ratio was 038x in the first quarter of 2022 see Figure 4Looking ahead as the supply constraints have mostly been solved it is  to see a strong period for crude tankers during the coming winter months and it is expected to be continued over the next few years In other words the supply and demand balance outlook is positive with oil consumption in 2023 expected to exceed its 2019 levels for the first time after the COVID19 outbreak and even grow more during 2024 In minutiae it is  that the supply in the crude tanker segment to grow by 11 and 05 by the end of 2023 and 2024 respectively Also on the demand side the demand for crude tanker volumes will improve by 12 in 2023 and 2024Additionally based on  report global oil inventories will decline and thus put upward pressure on crude oil prices in the second half of 2023 This upward trend is mainly due to the extended voluntary cuts of Saudi Arabias crude oil production and increasing global demand Meanwhile rising global crude oil production in 2024 will put moderate downward pressure on crude prices in the second quarter of 2024Analyzing KNOT Offshore Partners LPs financials and market outlook indicate that there is a particular concern associated with the Partnerships leverage and liquidity conditions They cut their dividend payments by 95 in the first and second quarter of 2023 thus this distribution cut may provide an opportunity for their free cash inflow exceeds free cash outflow However it may take years for the Partnership to deleverage and thus be able to increase its dividend payments Moreover thankfully the management signed new threeyear charter contracts and could successfully refinance some debt maturities As a result I prefer to keep an eye on the Partnerships leverage and liquidity conditions and thus I believe that a hold rating is appropriate for KNOP unitsAs always thank you for your reading and I welcome your comments   Past performance is no guarantee

364,Goehring & Rozencwajg Q2 2023 Natural Resource Market Commentary,Picture it if you will December of 2029 In a dimly lit private dining room the sound of cutlery clinking blends with spirited conversation Gathered at this stately round table is a diverse group of investors Some wear the hardfought wrinkles of significant gains while others wear the furrowed brows of regrettable losses What stratagems one wonders divided the winners from the less fortunateTo call the 2020s volatile might be akin to calling the sun slightly warm Consider 2020 with the globe in the clutches of COVID19 Then there was the inflationary flare of 2022 a fire stoked by Russias move on Ukraine Central banks as reactive as ever escalated rates in a dramatic fashion prompting many to toast to the Federal Reserves apparent mid2023 success Alas as the hypothetical scene suggests the party might have been prematureThe prevailing wisdom of 2023 still held that oil demand had seen its heyday in late 2019 How baffling then that by the end of the decade demand kept reaching new unexpected highs largely propelled by emerging markets like India A trust in the boundless potential of the US oil shales was dashed as production waned midway through our tumultuous decade The American solution releasing a sizable portion of its strategic reserves was a mere temporary salve and oils price ascended to dizzying heights In a few short years oil had gone from universally accepted as uninvestable to the mustown asset classA brief upturn in food prices post the RussianUkraine conflict turned out to be just the opening act The main event A succession of agricultural calamities the most severe being a midwest US drought eerily reminiscent of the 1930s Dust BowlRenewable energy hailed as the savior of both wallet and environment took a rather ironic turn With heavy government backing these clean energies seemed to generate only escalated electricity costs and persistent power shortages plaguing the very Western economies that championed themThe mighty dollar began the decade without peer Yet halfway through the 2020s the musical chairs of global monetary order began with nations gravitating towards their own currencies and the golden touch of precious metals to square off their imbalancesWith the dollars retreat the inflationary inferno pushed commodity demand significantly higher Bonds were not spared resulting in the central banks predictable rescue operation as governments had trouble rolling over their shortterm obligationsEquity markets too grappled with inflations weight and the diminishing lure of bonds A stark illustration The Dow Jones Industrial Averages  relationship with gold From a once formidable 201 ratio at the decades onset a historical crossroads loomed ten years later they looked set to cross  a rare event that had occurred only three times in 140 years 1896 19324 and 1980Retrospect at our 2029 table illuminated the follies and triumphs of a decade Those that had bought the must own assets of the early 2020s ie fixed income and growth stocks were rewarded with the worst inflationadjusted returns Conversely the assets most universally hated at the start of the 2020s ie hard assets produced the best returns by far Leading that hard asset class would be the quintessential hard asset goldThose farsighted souls who a decade earlier had the wisdom to acquire gold found themselves comfortably ensconced in the cozy realm of foresight While much of the market grappled rather inelegantly with the unforeseen maladies of the decade  resulting in discernible tangible losses in what were once deemed safe portfolios  these astute speculators sat on the very asset that the generalist hordes suddenly found irresistible Come the twilight of the 2020s they stood not just as benefactors of their own prudence but as the envy of many having firmly secured the reins of their financial futurePeering into fog of the future one is invariably met with a degree of uncertainty a kind of myopia if you will Yet it might amuse our diligent readership that the unforeseen turns and tempests in todays financial landscape were none other than the subjects dissected at our Fall 2022 Investor DayMarko Papic candidly expounded on our trajectory veering away from the quiet sanctity of a unipolar world to the cacophonous theaters of multipolarity The aspiring occupant of the Oval Office Vivek Ramaswamy elucidated on the curious ways ESG pressures have begun to distort corporate investment particularly when one treads the rugged terrains of natural resourcesLeigh Goehring sounded the clarion call on a looming metamorphosis  our gas fields both global and our own continental teetering on the brink of a structural deficit As for agriculture Shaun Hackett painted a frosty panorama hinting at the dawning of a global cooling epoch replete with its tantrums of volatile weather and crop yields that greatly disapointed Adam Rozencwajg warned of the faux allure of renewables focusing on the paradoxical energy crisis it might birth thanks to the nettlesome issue of their efficiency Edward Chancellor always the astute historian regaled us with tales of investment cycles drawing our gaze to the grand pendulum swings in energy and metals  a narrative of liquidation but promising prosperity in its aftermathNow its true that at Goehring  Rozencwajg our crystal ball isnt infallible Yet its in our DNA to speculate prognosticate and occasionally pontificate An interesting tapestry woven by our speakers was a shared spirit of contrarianism a thirst to not just see the future but to envision it with a tint different from the manyThe golden thread for our attendees A bullish outlook for several commodities But ah One precious element was not discussed gold The gilded metal we assert stands on the precipice of a roaring bull run perhaps echoing its luminous days of the  0s and the 2000s Despite its sluggish dance since the commodity rally began in May 2020 with golds mere 15 advance looking rather pale against the Rogers International Commodity Indexs 160 and the Goldman Sachs Spot Commodity Indexs 125 leap we sense an imminent turn of the tides Investors it seems might be getting one last golden ticketThose with long memories might remember how gold became the mustown asset of the 1970s We believe the same thing is happening today Gold demand will come from speculators seeking a shortterm profit and generalist investors seeking protection from financial turmoil and mounting inflationary pressures Gold and silver were radically undervalued in 1971 Over the next decade they were the bestperforming asset class Between 1970 and the peak in January 1980 gold and silver surged 2000 and 2800 respectivelyAfter peaking in 1980 gold spent the next 20 years drifting lower By 1999 it had become as cheap as ever on many metrics Between 1999 and today gold advanced more than eightfold significantly outperforming stocks and bonds Despite its strong appreciation we believe gold remains exceptionally cheap based on our framework In the following essay we will describe our valuation techniques and show that gold still has a considerable upside irrespective of what occurs in global financial marketsThe question remains Come 2029 on which side of the table do you envision yourselfGold is no different than any other asset class it becomes popular rises in price is overvalued and ultimately represents a poor investment Other times it undergoes periods of investor disinterest suffers sustained price declines becomes undervalued and ultimately represents an excellent investmentWe are not gold bugs Over the long term gold protects monetary debasement however unlike equities gold will provide little real return If an investor can identify periods when gold becomes extremely undervalued it can offer exceptional excess returns often uncorrelated with other financial assetsThe key is figuring out when gold is undervalued and overvaluedIn this essay we will describe the various valuation frameworks we have used over many years to estimate gold price targets and determine when to add or reduce our gold exposureIn May 2000 I was  and discussed golds radical undervaluation I predicted gold would reach 2500 per ounce before the bull market ended When the article was published gold was 275 per ounce and continuous central bank selling had left investors wildly bearish towards the socalled barbarous relic Our valuation framework pointed instead to substantial potential returns Although gold never hit our 2500 target it reached 1900 in 2011 and was the bestperforming asset class of the 2000sGold has been in a bull market for nearly a generation leaving many questioning if it still represents an attractive investment as in the late 1960s or 1990sAfter bottoming at 251 per ounce in August 1999 gold surged to 1900 in August 2011 pulled back to 1050 by December 2015 and resumed its advance making an alltime high tripletops of 2050 in August 2020 March 2022 and May 2023 However gold is now as undervalued as in 1999 on several metricsPotential gold investors must ask three questions First is gold undervalued today Second if gold is undervalued to what degree And finally how high could it go were it to swing from undervalued to overvalued  something that has happened twice in 100 yearsTo help answer the first question we compare the value of gold to both the money supply and the value of financial assets We also find it helpful to consider the historical relationship between gold and other commoditiesBelow are three charts that highlight these relationships over the last 100 years The first chart shows the relationship between the size of the US Treasurys gold holdings and the Federal Reserves balance sheet Although somewhat controversial we believe the size of the Feds balance is related to the dollar value of the Treasurys gold holdings over the long term According to this chart there have been two distinct periods over the past 100 years during which gold was highly overvalued and three periods during which gold was significantly undervaluedIn the late 1930s President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 65 raising the gold price to 35 per ounce At the same time clouds of war were gathering across Europe The combination of a higher gold price in the US and growing hostilities in Europe led to a massive volume of gold inflows in America At the peak the dollar value of the Treasurys gold holdings exceeded the size of the Feds balance sheet by an incredible 17 times The gold flows into the US were so great that the Treasury could have exchanged every dollar bill in circulation for gold and retained half of its gold stockThe golds second period of overvaluation occurred in January 1980 Gold spiked in a parabolic blowoff to 850 per ounce in January 1980 following two decades of accelerating inflation At the peak the Treasurys gold holdings vastly diminished from the late1930s levels were once again valued at 17 times the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheetGold turned out to be a terrible investment after both periods of radical overvaluation Between 1937 and 1971 gold was flat while the stock market advanced tenfold Between 1980 and 2000 gold fell 70 while the stock market ran thirteenfoldOn the other hand gold was radically undervalued three times The first period occurred in the late 1960s With gold fixed at 35 under the Bretton Woods Gold Exchange Standard and inflationary pressures mounting in the US gold flowed out of the Treasury By 1971 the Feds monetary base exceeded the Treasurys gold holdings by seven times The threedecade reversal was impressive between 1938 and 1971 the Treasurys gold holdings went from covering the Feds monetary base by 17 times to less than 15The second period of undervaluation occurred during the late 1990s Following twenty years of falling gold prices and a rapid expansion of the Feds balance sheet the size of the Feds monetary base exceeded the Treasurys gold holdings by nine times In other words the dollars unofficial and unconvertible gold coverage reached an alltime low of 11As we saw the periods of overvaluation the 1930s and 1980 were great opportunities to sell gold Conversely the periods of undervaluation 1969 and 1999 were excellent buying opportunities Gold was the bestperforming asset class in the decade following each period of maximum undervaluationGold relative to the size of the Feds balance sheet is more undervalued today than in the late 1960s or 1990s The reason even though gold advanced over sevenfold over the last twentythree years the Federal Reserves balance sheet has grown even faster Following the global financial crisis of 2008 global central banks have undertaken radical monetary policiesSince 2008 the Federal Reserve has undertaken four massive rounds of quantitative easing resulting in a monetary base nine times larger than in 1999 The Fed printed money faster than gold appreciated over the last twentythree years The Feds monetary base currently stands at over nine times the Treasurys gold holdings compared with six times in 1969 and nine times in 1999  the other two excellent buying opportunities According to our analysis gold is 30 more undervalued than in 1969 and on par with 1999Valuing gold against financial assets tells a similar story Chart 2 shows the relationship between gold and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Over the last 100 years there have been three periods during which gold was radically undervalued relative to financial assetsThe first period occurred in the late 1920s In response to a decade of rapid monetary growth in the US related to Britains failed attempt to peg the pound to gold at the preWorld War I rate the US stock market surged driven mainly by speculation funded by borrowed money From the 1921 lows the Dow appreciated sixfold hitting 380 in August 1929With gold fixed at 2065 per ounce the Dow by the fall of 1929 was equivalent to approximately eighteen ounces In retrospect the stock market was radically overvalued Over the next four years the Dow fell 90 bottoming at 42 At the lows the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold  an extreme reading that would not be repeated for fifty yearsIn January 1934 Roosevelt raised the gold price to 35 per ounce The Dow and gold nearly reached parity in 1932 however they missed each other by 7 per ounce and eighteen months Between 1929 and 1934 the Dow fell 80 while gold rose 70 From 1929 to 1935 gold radically outperformed global equity marketsThe next time financial assets were radically overvalued relative to gold occurred in the late 1960s The Dow first broke 1000 in 1966 and then again in 1969 and 1971 With gold still fixed at 35 per ounce the Dow was equivalent to twentyeight ounces a new record The 1960s experienced long periods of excess money and credit creation resulting in a speculative bull market again funded by debt In retrospect financial assets were overvalued Between the late 1960s and 1980 the Dow fell by 25 while gold advanced twentyfourfold Finally by 1980 the Dow and gold both hit 850Gold entered a grinding bear market following its record overvaluation in 1980 On the other hand financial assets spent the next two decades rallying Following the 1929 episode gold took fifty years to work off its overvaluation Following the 1980 peak gold only took twenty years to become cheap relative to financial assets Between 1980 and 1999 gold fell by 68 from 850 to 253 per ounce while the Dow advanced thirteenfold from 850 to 11000 A prudent investor ought to have been out of the gold market entirelyIn 1999 the Dow surpassed 11000 while gold had fallen to 253 per ounce The Dow was equivalent to fortythree ounces of gold at those levels  an alltime record Given these extreme levels an investor ought to have expected a booming bull market in gold to develop Indeed that is what I expected when I made my investments and gave my interview to Forbes in 2000We were handsomely rewarded Between 1999 and 2011 gold surged sevenfold becomingthe bestperforming asset class of the decade Global equities suffered two massive bear markets ending the period where it startedOver the last decade the stock market has again entered another huge bull market leaving the Dow equivalent to 20 ounces of gold The question is whether this represents under or overvaluation Financial bulls ie gold bears might highlight how the Dow has been equivalent to thirty ounces of gold in the late 1960s and forty ounces in the late 1990s In this context 201 does not appear radically undervalued Perhaps the equity bull market will continue Unfortunately for equity markets we firmly believe otherwiseChart 3 gives us great confidence that todays 201 ratio will end up being the cycle peak and that over the next several years the Dow will be equivalent to fewer than five ounces of gold the level reached at golds peak in 2011 The Dow and gold may again cross similar to what happened in 1980 and almost happened in 19324Each peak in the Dowgold ratio 1929 1969 and 1999 coincided with periods of commodity undervaluation As each commodity bull market started the Dowgold ratio contracted massively In 1929 commodities bottomed relative to financial assets exactly as the Dow reached a high of twenty ounces of gold equivalent Four short years later commodities were overvalued relative to financial assets and the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold after having rallied 70In 1968 the year President Johnson removed the US dollars required 25 gold backing commodities were the cheapest in history relative to financial assets At that moment the Dow peaked at twentyeight ounces of gold Over the next twelve years commodities entered a massive bull market and by 1980 had become radically overvalued Gold led the bull market and soared twentyfourfold from 35 to 800 per ounce Like in 1929 the Dowgold ratio peaked in 1968 at precisely the same time commodities bottomed By January 1980 the Dow was equivalent to one ounce of gold  the lowest reading since the Dow Jones Industrial Average was established in 1896In 1999 commodities were almost as radically undervalued as in the late 1960s The Dowgold ratio reached an alltime high of fortytwo just as commodities bottomed As commodity prices rose the Dowgold ratio contracted reaching eight in 2011Were commodities overvalued today we would agree that the boom in financial assets and bear market in gold still had years left to run Under these circumstances the Dowgold ratio would continue to move significantly higher Instead commodities are as undervalued as they have ever been relative to financial assets According to our historical framework a commodity bull market has likely started As such we believe the Dow equivalent to twenty ounces of gold probably represents a cyclehigh and will fall throughout the decade similar to 1929 1969 and 1999How high could prices go if we enter a new gold bull marketIn past gold bull markets the value of the Treasurys gold holdings has surpassed the monetary base by over 15 times  including in 1980 after the US dollar was no longer backed by goldGiven the Feds balance sheet explosion since 2009 a projected target price for gold seems outlandish The Feds monetary base today stands at 56 tr For the Treasurys gold holdings to cover the monetary base by 15 times gold would have to reach 32000 per ounce Critics might argue the monetary base is distorted by excess reserves left on balance at the Fed At present excess reserves foot to 32 tr and the Fed has talked of someday draining them out of the system If that were to happen the Feds monetary base would fall to 24 trillion Even under this conservative scenario gold would have to reach 14000 for the Treasurys gold position to cover the monetary base by 15 times Although these numbers sound outlandish they represent relationships that have emerged twice in the past 100 years The first time the late 1930s was during massive deflation while the second 1970 was during inflation In both scenarios gold had become the must own asset class that all investors clamored for and the valuation of gold was pushed to the extremeCould the dollar value of the Treasurys gold holdings reach 15 times the monetary base as it has twice in the last 100 years We believe its highly probable As financial turmoil surges this decade investors will aggressively buy gold as an asset class that provides both wealth protection and the opportunity for huge speculative profit In such a scenario golds valuation could very well be pushed to extremes just like it was in the late 1930s and 1980 What about looking at the DowGold relationshipIn the 1930s the Fed aggressively shrunk its balance sheet by half producing a deflation implosion that turned into the Great Depression At the worst point in the crisis the Dow traded at half its 80 book value By 1934 gold now at 35 per ounce nearly reached parity with the Dow Currently the Dows book value is 8000 Were the Fed to undertake equally draconian hawkish measures as in the 1930s something we believe to be unlikely the Dow could conceivably trade for half its book value or 4000 Were gold to trade at parity to the Dow like it nearly did in 1934 it would more than double In other words in the most extreme deflationary scenario the Dow would fall almost 90 while gold would double  similar to between 1929 and 1934 Investors with a substantial gold allocation would do very wellIn the late 1970s the Fed ultimately raised interest rates to record levels in a final successful attempt to break the inflationary forces of the past twenty years Record real rates put severe downward pressure on global equities By 1980 the Dow traded at its book value of 850 Gold reached parity with the Dow in January 1980If we repeat the 1970s and the Fed raised interest rates significantly because of persistent acceleration in inflation we should see a huge bear market in the Dow with a downside target of its 8000 book value If history were to repeat the 1970s experience the Dow toenter a huge bear market and potentially trade down 75 to its book value and gold prices would rise four fold Again investors with significant gold allocations would be the winnersFinally let us consider a third scenario that has never occurred in 230 years of US financial history What might happen if the US directly monetized its debtGiven the massive amount of sovereign debt held by governments worldwide and the inherent refinancing risks that it creates countries including the US may attempt to directly monetize their debt in response to a potential failure of a government debt auction Were this to happen inflationary pressures would surge and hyperinflation may ensue Our hunch is that equities markets may rise but gold would enter a massive bull market as investors sought assets to protect against currency debasement and the resulting inflation In such a scenario gold could easily surpass 35000 per ounce  15 times todays 56 tr monetary base Once again the winners would be gold investorsIn our view gold will emerge as the asset class with the most potential this decade no matter the financial or geopolitical backdrop Under the most extreme scenarios a repeat of the deflationary implosion that produced the Great Depression or a period of inflation that verges on hyperinflation gold will be the winning asset classCommodities and related natural resource markets were broadly weak in the second quarter Investors remained concerned about a global recession driven by rising interest rates and persistent central bank hawkishness Adding to the overall gloom was a perceived disappointment in Chinese economic activity Caused by problems in the real estate sector disappointing exports and weakerthanexpected aggregate economic data investors were decidedly riskoff  when it came to China and commodity markets were not sparedWith its heavy energy focus the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index fell almost 6 while the Rogers International Commodity Index emphasizing metals and agricultural commodities fell by 25Natural resourcerelated equities were weak as well The SP North American Natural Resource Stock Index heavily energy weighted fell 1 during the quarter while the SP Global Natural Resources Index  more metal and agricultural exposure fell almost 6 By comparison global equity markets were strong during the second quarter the SP 500 rose 8 while the MSCI All Country World index advanced almost 6Metals were among the weakest performers in the second quarter reflecting concerns about China Copper prices pulled back 9 despite easily mobilized copper inventories approaching alltime lows during the quarter Nickel fared even worse falling by 14 Aluminum meanwhile fell by 11 while zinc plummeted by 21 Coldrolled steel fell almost 25 in the ferrous metal sector while iron ore fell 10 Mining equities were also weak The  ETF which tracks copper equities fell by almost 3 while the SP Global Base Metals Index fell by 4Weak LNG and Chinese worries drove coal prices lower Australian and South African thermal coal pulled back 30 and 22 respectively In the US coal with access to seaborne markets notably Central Appalachian and Illinois Basin fell 28 and 32 respectively after surging last yearThe oil market was also weak during the second quarter West Texas Intermediate WTI fell almost 7 during the quarter while Brent fell 5 Energyrelated equities were mixed The  ETF megacap international energy weighted fell 2 However the SP Oil  Gas EP index and the  oil service stock ETF were strong rising by 1 and 4 respectivelyGlobal energy demand continues to surprise to the upside and even the IEA has raised its estimates For example at the end of 2022 the IEA estimated global oil demand would average 1016 mm barrels per day  a significant 17 mm increase over 2022 In their June Oil Market Report the IEA raised their 2023 demand estimate by an additional 700000 bd with the bulk of their underestimation again coming from China Since the end of 2022 the IEA has raised its Chinese oil demand estimates by 400000 bdResponding to global recession worries the IEA reduced global oil demand by 200000 bd in its July 2023 OMR However we believe the IEA is still radically underestimating global oil demand and that further upward revisions must be made For example the IEA has 13 mm bd of missing barrels in its first quarter 2023 balances Our readers know that missing barrels represent the excess of supply less demand that are missingliterally they cant be found in global inventories Historically the IEA has made missing barrels disappear by revising global demand upwards and we believe this time will be no different We believe the weakness in oil prices in the second quarter cant be explained by faltering demandWe believe the primary weakness in global oil prices in the second quarter is unexpected supply issues In the final week of March the US government began selling an additional 26 mm barrels of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil under previously legislated Congressional mandates All 26 mm barrels had been sold by the last week of June Over the next four years the DOE under Congressional mandate was scheduled to sell an additional 155 mm barrels of oil out of the SPR 25 mm barrels in 2024 and 2025 and 35 mm barrels in 2026 and 2027 and these sales would represent almost 50 of the remaining SPR reserveIn July however the DOE announced the cancellation of these sales as part of the attempt to begin refilling the SPR Over the last 18 months 330 mm barrels have been released by US European and Japanese SPR and have been 100 responsible for the slight build weve seen in commercial inventories Given Julys DOE announcement SPR sales will be zero over the next four years which we believe has already begun impacting oil prices We think its no coincidence that oil prices rebounded almost 18 since the last week in Junejust as US SPR releases wound downSPR sale cancellations combined with rapidly slowing production growth from the Permian basin and unexpected production cuts from Saudi Arabia mean that commercial inventories will experience rapid drawdowns in the second half of 2023Natural gas staged a massive rebound in the second quarter advancing 26 European gas still influenced by swollen inventories related to last winters record warmth fell by 26 Asian gas also continued its retreatfalling 5With the restart of the Freeport LNG export facility US inventories have begun to decline versus historical averages even in the face of highly cool weather at the beginning of the 2023 air conditioning season Adjusted for population cooling degree days were 33 below average for May and June US natural gas inventories peaked relative to tenyear averages in midMarch just before the Freeport facility returned to service and now sit only 6 above tenyear averagesWe remain incredibly bullish on natural gas prices The Natural Gas section of the letter discusses the rollover in Marcellus natural gas production and how the 40 plunge in the Haynesville rig count over the last six months will severely impact its output in the next six months In the next eighteen months we will add close to 6 bcf per day in LNG export capacity and our modeling continues to suggest that US natural gas supply will begin a prolonged contraction starting now Convergence of US natural gas pricespresently at 250 per MMBtu with international pricespresently at 12mmbtuis practically unavoidable given our modeling of both US natural gas demand and supply Much of the turmoil in global gas markets weatherrelated over the last twelve months has given investors another extremely opportunistic chance to invest in North American natural gas marketsUranium rose 10 from 50 to 55 per pound in the second quarter In the Uranium section of the letter we discuss our updated supply and demand models for uranium and their implications Since 2011postFukushimathe global uranium market has been in massive surplus as Japans 50 reactors came offline and global uranium supply surgedprimarily from Kazakhstan Between 2011 and 2018 we calculate global uranium inventories built by over 265 m lbs resulting in substantial downward price pressureuranium prices bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 18 per lbHowever as our models suggest the uranium market has now slipped firmly back into deficit Also the Yellow Cake and Sprott Uranium Trust closedend physical uranium investment vehicles have removed over 80 mm lbs of uranium over the last five years Since 2020 we calculate that uranium has shifted back to deficit and that commercial inventories have been drawn down by 180 mm tonnes We calculate excess commercial uranium inventories related to the Fukushimarelated shutdowns have now been 50 worked down and stand at approximately 250 mm lbs covering reactor demand by less than 18 monthsDepending on how much physical uranium the two closedend vehicle buy in 2023 and 2024 we calculate that 100 of the excess Fukushimarelated inventory will have been consumed by the end of 2024 Given the deficit between power generation demand and mine supply and given that almost all easily mobilized Fukishimarelated inventory has been removed from the market we believe uranium prices could move chaotically to the upsideGlobal agricultural markets fell in the second quarter Corn fell 16 wheat fell 8 and soybeans rose 35Fertilizers also sold off Urea the solid form of nitrogen fell 10 phosphate fell 27 and potash fell 3 We believe the correction has run its course and markets have now set up for another crisis

365,Public Storage Short Thesis: Supply Glut Coincides With Declining Demand,"Public Storage  is trading at a high multiple of 207X AFFO at a time when selfstorage is oversupplied Occupancy and rates are already dropping substantially with significantly more developments in the pipeline Selfstorage inventory was built up to meet eventdriven demand of the postpandemic surge which will result in significant competition and price cuts as demand drops back downFactors unique to the selfstorage sector make way for a harder landing than would be possible in more traditional real estateAllow me to begin with acknowledging that I was too early in this thesis Back in 2017 I wrote an article about PSA being  While PSA has underperformed the SP since then it is still a positive return which makes a short position unsuccessfulWhile I was clearly far too early I think the fundamentals remain in place that make PSA a dangerous investmentIf one observes the last few decades selfstorage has been an amazingly strong sector It has enjoyed consistently strong organic growth with only brief dips in recessions PSA as the largest player in the space has captured its fair share of the upsideMost of the time when trends go on for decades there is some sort of underlying stability However I dont think that is the case with selfstorage While the demand function of most real estate sectors is wellbounded within clear macroeconomic guardrails the demand function of selfstorage is completely unboundedAllow me to elaborate as to what I mean by this Housing for example has clear guardrails The number of households will be related to population and GDP As population and GDP rise the number of households rises but because GDP and population stay within a fairly tight band the demand for housing stays within a tight bandIndustrial also had guardrails in that demand for warehouses and manufacturing facilities was related to overall retail sales As retail sales increased demand for industrial real estate increased but it was at a slow and measured pace The birth of ecommerce broke through the upper guardrail in that it functioned as a multiplier on the ratio of industrial space needed per sale Ecommerce is the new guardrail and I think it is quite firmly here to stay which keeps industrial in a new steady stateSelfstorage is more lawless There is no natural economic factor to which demand is tied The overall demand for selfstorage space is contingent on the percentage of US households that utilize selfstorageAccording to the Wall Street Journal which used data from EXRThat is a very nebulous numberWhy did it go from 27 to 106What is stopping it from going back down to 27I think the selfstorage market has been lulled into a false sense of security by their baseline demand factor going up 4X from 27 to 106 in the last 40 yearsThat is not normal In fact it is extraordinarily atypical and exists only in a small pocket of the world for a small portion of modern timesThere was a period of time in REITs known as the retail apocalypse in which over the course of a few quarters the market collectively realized that the US was over retailed Retail REIT stocks collapsed as it became broadly known that the United States had somewhere between 150300 the retail square footage per capita of other developed nations depending on whom you compared us toThat is tiny compared to the magnitude of selfstorage in the US compared to the rest of the worldAccording to Converting to feet that is 118 million square feet in Europe The US has over 17 billion square feet of selfstorageAccording to a 2018 Statista survey 90 percent of worldwide selfstorage inventory is in the USThis is a strictly American phenomenon based on our propensity to buy lots of stuff That extreme level of consumerism is required to maintain the 106 of households that pay for selfstorageMaybe that can be maintained but it is far from certain I think the natural level of demand is much lowerSo what happens if that 106 of households paying for selfstorage drifts back down to the former 27 level a level which is still high compared to most of history and compared to the rest of the worldSelfstorage is among the easiest property types to develop As demand has grown the number of units has grown to meet that demand That is how most real estate works but most real estate has guardrailsApartments and Industrial had the same wave of supply in the 20222023 timeframe but that will merely take occupancy rates down to about 93 and 94 respectively The demand in those sectors is permanent as long as the population of the US is permanent and the internet is capable of creating ecommerce ordersIn selfstorage the supply has been built up to match a lofty and unsustainable level of demand The displacement of the pandemic resulted in a surge of demand Rather than the sector just enjoying the good times it built supply as if that demand was permanent399 million square feet were developed in 2022 with another 525 million square feet on the way in 2023 to above dataOver the last 5 years 254 million square feet of selfstorage was developed in the US That is more than twice the entire selfstorage industry in all of EuropeAll of this supply is predicated on a notion that the 106 level of utilization is sustainable It is a blind extrapolation of historical growth It relies on a level of utilization that has only been made possible by extreme goodsbased consumerismHumans will always spend money on the stuff that makes them happy Perhaps they should Im not here to judge anyoneBut what happens when the things that make people happy changeInstead of physical goods maybe people start preferring vacations Or perhaps they start preferring digital goods like a library of music on Spotify over their former CD collectionIm not suggesting that I can know where utilization rates will go but I do think it is dangerous to build up supply as if the alltime record demand level will last foreverBack when utilization rates were at 27 the number of selfstorage units in the US was just a fraction of what it is today On todays level of supply that 27 level represents roughly 80 vacancy ratesAs there is no other clear use for selfstorage facilities the value would drop to the value of the land Those which are welllocated could be redeveloped for other purposes but most would sufferThere are preliminary bits of evidence that utilization is in fact droppingAt a national level vacancy is starting to creep back up toward the historical 10As the pandemic gets further away people are returning to more stable lives and pulling their stuff back out of storage unitsThe result is that rental rates are collapsing albeit from the surge highs20 lost rental rates on top of declining occupancy is likely to make for a rough remainder of 2023Apartments and industrial are absorbing their 2023 supply surge as demand remains strong Thus the new units are mostly absorbed by new demand and only partially hurting occupancyIn selfstorage demand growth appears to be negative in 2023 from the aforementioned return to postpandemic normalcy Thus vacancy is rising both from the new units and from negative absorptionConstruction is concentrated in a handful of submarkets with the top 10 as followsUnfortunately for PSA these are most of their top markets by NOIHighlighted in yellow are the markets in common with the 10 highest new construction marketsWhere utilization rates go is completely unknown If it stays at 106 this will be a normal cyclical recession for the space If it dips it could be disastrousThe challenge for PSAs stock is that even if utilization stays at historically high levels it appears significantly overvaluedThe selfstorage sector as a whole is expensive with a 173X PAFFO That strikes me as too high given the rental rate contraction data that is already availableOther REIT sectors trade at significantly cheaper multiples with positive growth outlooksWithin the sector PSA trades at the highest multiple of 207X 2023 AFFOAt a property level I think valuations have peaked because cap rates are sitting at a level below prevailing interest ratesGiven where the Fed Funds rate is I would anticipate cap rates climbing to about 8 and since it looks like NOI is going down that change would likely come from price declinesEven as data has come out showing higher vacancy rates and significant rental rate declines PSAs stock has not respondedThis suggests that the upcoming weakness has not been priced in at allFair value consists of a composite of various plausible scenarios weighted by the chance of occurrence The scenario in which vacancy skyrockets due to selfstorage utilization falling back into the 2s is the downside scenario My base case is that utilization remains roughly where it is with merely the pandemic surge getting undoneThis suggests negative AFFOshare growth in the short to medium term followed by more normal growth In general this sort of trajectory would warrant an AFFO multiple closer to 10X but PSA does have some strong attributes which could justify a higher multipleGiven these positive attributes I see fair value at around 14X AFFO which represents about 33 downside from todays priceShorting in general is riskier than going long because the downside of a short is theoretically infinite That said there are a few aspects which make a PSA short a bit more approachable1 it is a large company with low volatility which suggests the chance of going parabolic is reduced2 As the most expensive and largest in its sector there is no company that could reasonably buy out PSA accretively3 PSA has minimal existing short interest which largely prevents a short squeezeAvailability of shares to short will depend on ones custodian Given the magnitude of float and lack of existing short interest PSA should be available at most custodians without a hard to borrow feeRight now there are abnormally great investment opportunities With the market crash some fundamentally strong stocks have gotten outrageously cheap and I want to show you how to take

367,StealthGas: Flying Under The Radar,In the intricate mosaic of the global shipping industry certain players while being fundamental often remain unnoticed StealthGas Inc  is one such entity maneuvering silently within the LPG sector and crafting a unique success story As the worldStealthGas serves as a global conduit for transporting liquefied petroleum gas and other related gas products These products which are liquefied derivatives of natural gas and crude oil encompass substances like propane butane butadiene isoprene propylene vinyl chloride monomer and other similar liquefied gases The company boasts one of the most expansive independent LPG carrier fleets in the world ranging from 3000 to 8000 cubic meters with additional vessels capable of holding up to 40000 cbm These vessels transport goods all over the world but due to high rates they mostly trade west of the Suez in the EU Mediterranean Sea area Overall the LPG segment has benefited from increased rates due to the RussiaUkraine War and the associated EU regulations concerning Russian energy EU countries have sought energy elsewhere and LPG ships have helped fill the energy gap which has benefited worldwide fleet ratesHistorically GASS like many in the sector has been highly leveraged with a majority of cash flows being used to pay debt obligations and acquire new vessels The changing market dynamic recently has led GASS to be in a much better situation They have paid off a large amount of their debt and their profitability is at all time highSimilar to the  we see structural supply and demand differences in the market We see LPG rates continue to climb as LPG ships get older and reach the end of their operational lives We see the limited growth of worldwide fleets benefiting the whole LPG space but especially GASS due to their low leverageStealthGas showcased a record performance in the first half of 2023 marking its highest profitability for any H1 at 105 million The company leveraged the rising asset prices to actively sell vessels with four vessels already sold and two smaller LPGs Eco Dream and Eco Green set to be sold for around 35 million Despite operating with four fewer vessels the company noted a slight increase in net voyage revenues to 672 million In chartering StealthGas secured employment for 80 of 2023s remaining days translating to 90 million in revenues for future periods Unlike others in the industry GASS has no vessels operating in the spot market which limits their ability to make more from higher rates but also limits their downside as the ships are lock in on profitable contractsIn Q2 StealthGas observed a 5 decline in adjusted net income However during the sixmonth span there was an impressive growth in profits moving from 20 million to 28 million 40 YoY A notable accomplishment for the company was the significant reduction of its debt decreasing from 3166 million in June 2022 to a mere 1667 million by June 2023 This substantial reduction resulted from a mix of robust earnings and vessel sales With the current margin rates GASSs total debt equates to 158 quarters of net income Moreover with its longterm debt due within the upcoming year at 166 million and a healthy cash reserve of 481 million GASS is financially solid This allows the company to prioritize investor returns and fleet expansion over the need of debt repayment The net debt standing at 839 million further bolsters the potential for investor returns in the foreseeable future The strong financial positioning allows GASS to fund expansion with debt instead of equity dilution and has allowed them to secure 30 million for a new vesselStealthGass liquidity inclusive of restricted cash and shortterm investments was recorded at 551 million at the quarters end This was a drop from the previous years 957 million mainly attributed to the strategic debt repayment The companys investments in joint ventures dropped to 38 million following a hefty 192 million dividend received post the sale of a vessel StealthGas also achieved a noncash gain of 29 million from the sale of two vessels while simultaneously recognizing a noncash impairment of 28 million on the agreed sale of two vessels set for delivery in January 2024 Interest and finance costs were slightly diminished for the quarter despite a threefold rate increase in the comparative periods This was a result of StealthGass aggressive debt repayment strategy aiming to mitigate interest costsOperationally in Q2 2023 GASS saw a 12 reduction in calendar days while net revenues for the quarter stood firm at 331 million Over a sixmonth period there was a slight 1 increase in costs compared to the prior year even with a reduced fleet size The quarterly operating expenses climbed to 134 million mainly due to inflationary factors that were especially noticeable in the first quarter Contracted days remain high for 2023 with projections showing 90 million in revenues up to 2026 All vessels for 2023 drydocking have been serviced which shows they are ready for a productive next couple of quarters The drydocking costs which were at 15 million for Q2 and 26 million over the previous six months This significant increment was due to the drydocking of three of the four Handysize vessels in the fleet These larger vessels naturally incur higher expenses when dry docked which occurs every five yearsGASS has been selling their older ships reinvesting the proceeds and utilizing their better capital structure to secure financing for purchases of new ships through a collection of Joint Ventures and financed purchases GASS has been selling their smaller vessels and moving in to larger more modern and more efficient vessels These vessels will be coming online over the next couple of quarters and should lead to an increase in not only GASSs capabilities but also their revenue and profit generationThese large vessels known as VLGCs command higher rates and in June of this year commanded  rate The move in to more modern vessels not only expands their top line revenue but also protects them from upcoming regulations that will affect a variety of global vesselsThe age old question of investing When can I see a return Due to GASSs historically high leverage they have not been in a position to return cash to investors through dividends or stock buybacks During the recent earnings call when asked about capital return Harry Vafias responded with the followingWhen examining a company for capital returns we like to take a look at a modified version of total shareholder yield We take the combination of Dividends and Stock Buybacks relative to trailing twelve month Net Income GASS over the last 12 months has spent 0 on dividends and has the ability not obligation to purchase roughly 10 million worth of stock Against a TTM net income of 417 million Showing a modified shareholder yield of 24 This to us shows what percentage of net income is being used to bolster investors vs bolstering the companyCurrently trading at 184 million GASS approval of 10 million in stock buyback translates to a possible 5 reduction in total outstanding shares for GASS while only needing roughly 14 of net income We believe that this fact alone is what makes GASS a buy at current prices Add in the FWD valuations of EVEBITDA of 366 and Pricetobook of 34 we believe that GASS offers significant upside from current prices If elevated rates and high profitability continue we expect to see similar percentages of net income going to stock buybacksWhile risks are evident in the volatile and capital intensive shipping market we believe that the low leverage prudent management new fleet and market dynamics are in GASS favor We believe that the lack of a dividend low market cap and existence in the Oil and Gas Sector have led to underinvestment and under coverage in GASS from many market investors Despite the recent performance of the stock up 83 YTD believe that there is more upside in the stock Due to the low float and high upside potential from earnings beats and ship deliveries on the horizon we see GASS as a strong buy up to 7 At 7 we see PE come more in line with industry peersWe believe that at current prices the stock presents little downside risk and see little reason to hedge below current prices We believe any further drop in price will incentivize management to begin their repurchase program which will buoy the stock In addition to this the lack of dividends is also a bonus of r along position at this point Catalysts that may cause downslide slippage would be weaknesses in the LPG market which could be caused by SupplyDemand miss matches or through a warm winter requiring less energy than expected From a trading perspective we see much greater chances of upside with the stock trading at low valuations and relatively low Implied Volatility we are going to be initiating a synthetic long here In this specific example we will be selling 5 Mar 2024 Cash Covered Puts and then using the proceeds to purchase 5 and 750 Calls Mar 2024 This strategy will provide us with limited downside protection and offer unlimited upside on a stock that we believe is chronically undervalued   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor

369,Navios Maritime Partners: Strong Quarter Results Amid Challenging Logistical Market,I am invested in various value stocks and one on my radar is Monacobased shipping company Navios Maritime Partners LP  It has a decent dividend yield of 118 with an annual payout rate of 020 DespiteNavios Maritime expects net fleet growth in 2023 and 2024 despite geopolitical concerns that have disrupted supply and demand across the globe The maritime giant is bolstering its fleet of tankers with two Japanese MR2 productNavios Maritimes gross fleet value as of Q2 2023 stood at 44 billion with a net fleet equity of 22 billion The company boasts of a contracted revenue of 33 billion on its modern fleet with an average age of at least 98 years Despite having a higher market cap of 141 billion Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd  total revenues for Q2 2023  618 YoY to 131 billion as the company sought to overhaul its fleet profile and instead advance its ESG goalsOn its part Navios Maritime increased its profitability in Q2 2023 boosted by capital gains from the sale of ships especially container ships and tanker ships that recorded stronger earnings The company had spent 80 million as of Q4 2022 on the acquisition of two Japanese newbuilding MR2 vessels The company was optimistic that it would attain 525 million as the aggregate EBITDA for the 2 MR2 vessels after five years with a 13 annual yield Aside from that Navios is looking at an aggregate charter revenue of 845 million with a 20 residual value after the charter contractThe delivery of the two new builds is expected by the end of H1 2026 and H1 2027 Navios managed to negotiate a similar interest rate on both consignments meaning that they will each cost about 402 million eachAlready Navios has 2701 million in cash as of Q2 2023 representing an increase of 266 QoQ Each of the two MR2 vessels will be chartered out during the 5 years at a net rate of 22959 This gain is significant since the company has at least 175 ships in water as well as under construction The new acquisition will put Navios total fleet at 177 ships comprising 81 bulk ship carriers 47 containers and 49 tankers Under construction are about a dozen boxships 6 MR2s and 6 AframaxLR2s I have known Navios to not shy away from making big purchases as long as there is a perceived value at stake In Q2 2023 the company agreed to buy the 2019 Navios Horizon 1 for 28 million built and chartered I also expect the 81692 dwt ship to be delivered by Q3 2023Despite experiencing an almost 50 YoY drop in the charter market in Q2 2023 Danaos Corporation  recorded 241 million in operating revenue and even secured about 500 million in new charter contracts in the quarter By the end of the quarter DACs total charter backlog  to 25 backlog with the contracted charter coverage 99 for 2023 and 86 for 2024For Navios Q2 2023 contracted revenue stood at 468 million identified as longterm revenue from 3 contracted MR2 vessels These vessels are responsible for an average daily net pay range of 21831 for at least 2 yearsAs noted earlier fleet proceeds YTD from the gross sale of 13 vessels in the quarter yielded about 2422 million In Q1 2023 Navios generated 1603 million in Q2 2023 it generated 596 million and in Q3 2023 it is expected to generate the remaining 223 million From the total of 2422 million Navios intends to spend about 1084 million in acquiring 2 new building MR2 vessels to be delivered by 2027 and an additional 3 new building capsize vessels for delivery within 2023The newbuilding development by Navios has used up almost 95 of its available financing In Q2 2023 the company arranged a total of 3502 million in new financing which I think came in at an opportune moment since its total debt stands at 222 billion In its Q2 2023 transcript Navios explained that it organized its first export credit agency backed facilities in China and South Korea Of the 3502 million attained 2878 million is expected to refinance 36 vessels which are already existing facilities with an average margin of 24 running for about 3 to 5 years The remaining 624 million will be used to finance the two Japanese newbuilding MR2 vessels at an implied interest rate of 700 for a 10year termIn the containership section Navios acquired 12 vessels for 860 million hedged on a longterm credit line and expected to generate about 11 billion in contracted revenue in about 65 years Then there is also the LR2 Aframax tanker subsector where the company ordered 6 vessels for 380 million In the dry bulk newbuilding section Navios is looking at 81 vessels with an average age of 104 years and a carrying capacity of 99 mdwt The contracted revenue from the dry bulk fleet is the lowest at 308 million against 21 billion from container shipsNavios expects the global GDP to grow by 3 in both 2023 and 2024 bolstered by the rising demand for world oil Reports  that in the first 7 months of 2023 crude oil imports into China grew 124 clocking 1224 million tons It is expected the Chinese economic growth in 2024 may be delayed if the RussianUkraine war persists I am also looking at slower industrial production and the constant overhang of inventory as possible inhibitors of the recovery of the shipping industryAnalysts expect dry bulk cargo volume to rise 15 and 25 in 2023 and a range of 1 to 2 in 2024 Sanctions on Russian coal are also expected to motivate a 05 and 15 increase in average haul in 2023 This trend will also positively affect the shipment of iron ore and grain shipments in Brazil With the abandonment of the Black Sea grain export deal by Russia due to the ongoing war Navios expects to reap additional grain volume transportation from Brazil Europe and Russia Overall seaborne grain trade is expected to grow by 25 in 2023 aloneNavios pricetoearnings ratio TTM stands at 114 against the industry average of 1966 This mark leaves off a difference of 9422 The enterprise value against EBITDA TTM also stands at 411 against the industry average of 1203 indicating a difference of 6586 It is not uncommon for highvalue shipping stocks to have low PE ratios GSLs PE ratio stands at 218 against the industry average of 1966 a difference of 8891 I think NMM is slightly undervalued and has a strong upside potential especially when the 2 new MR2 Japanese vessels come onlineThe persistent uncertainty over grain and fertilizer supplies from Ukraine due to the ongoing war may affect global shipping into 2024 Wheat futures have also been plummeting in 2023 lower than 58 per bushel Global consumption of the commodity may also be revised lower with forecasts down 34 million tons to 7961 millionNavios also indicated in its transcript that seaborne coal trade is expected to decrease by 27 in H2 2023 due to the shifting patterns caused by the RussianUkraine warI also feel that the LR2Aframax subsector tankers ordered by Navios for 380 million will not generate enough money to cover the expenses not unless I am missing something from the statistics The company ordered 6 vessels to be chartered out at an average net daily rate of 26580 per day for 5 years These vessels are expected to generate roughly 290 million meaning that the company will incur a loss of about 90 million exclusive of any maintenance chargesNavios Maritime Partners has increased its profitability over time bolstered by capital gains from ship sales and accretive acquisitions in the industry Q2 2023 has seen the company register strong earnings especially from container ships and tankers within its diversified fleet portfolio I am looking forward to the delivery of its new build tanker fleet from Japan and the recovery of the global logistical economy as the key drivers to the companys growth into 2024 For these reasons I recommend a hold rating for the stock   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a

370,AGCO: Cultivating Success In Deere's Backyard,Its time to talk about a company that makes me mildly nervous That company is the Georgiabased  Its much larger peer Deere  Company  is one of myWhile I stick to everything Ive ever written in my Deere articles it needs to be said that AGCO is turning into an increasingly strong competitor that deserves recognitionOver the past five years AGCO stock has returned 140 Deere has returned close to 200 While I continue to believe that Deere is the way to go itIn this article well talk about the companys increasingly impressive growth strategy agriculture fundamentals and some of the companys comments during the most recent Morgan Stanley Annual Laguna Conference on September 12So lets get to itIn general I would make the case that theres no reason why anyone absolutely needs to invest in agriculturePersonally I am investing in agriculture for two reasons The secondary reason is that its my passion Im fascinated by agriculture and the importance of the agriculture supply chainThe primary reason does not come with a bias Companies selling toptier agriculture equipment the ones with a wide moat tend to be terrific tools for outperforming capital gains  especially during times of elevated inflation when farmers see rising farm incomeSince the year 2000 both Deere and AGCO have outperformed the SP 500 by a wide margin unfortunately with expected elevated volatilityMost people are familiar with Deere I have heard countless country songs about the company Its also by far the biggest tractor company in the world with a market cap more than 10x larger than AGCOs 9 billion market capAGCO although smaller is still a significant player in the industry The company is the owner of Fendt Massey Ferguson Valtra and ChallengerAdditionally AGCO also owns smaller brands like Gleaner and companies such as GSI that specialize in building crop storage solutions among other thingsWhile these companies are large in their home markets Massey is British Fendt is German the company is launching a fullscale attack on North and South American marketsWith that said like its peers the company benefits from a number of tailwindsDuring the recent annual Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference the company highlighted the robust longterm fundamentals driven by global population growth expanding middle class and increasing demand for proteinThe current stockstouse ratio in grains exChina is at a multidecade low suggesting that we need multiple good crop years before supply and demand conditions normalize againIt also highlighted the impact of biofuels on grain demand and profitability in the farming sectorThe war in Ukraine has influenced crop challenges and elevated grain prices encouraging farmers to invest in modernizing their equipmentMoreover the age of the average farmer fleet presents an opportunity for equipment upgrades further fueled by advancing technologyThe overall industry dynamics suggest a positive demand outlook leading into 2024Despite a decline in key crop prices like corn soybeans and wheat demand remains strong as visible in the companys order booksFurthermore there are two other major tailwindsOn top of this the company is focusing on precision equipment as part of its aggressive expansion strategyThe precision equipment segment includes equipment like planters sprayers and whatnot that are able to operate with extremely high precision This lowers input costs like fertilizers and often boosts yields significantlyBy 2025 the company aims to do 1 billion in precision sales Using analyst estimates precision sales could account for almost 7 of total salesThe company has also achieved substantial success by retrofitting precision technology into the aftermarket distinguishing itself by being OEMagnosticAGCOs approach allows retrofitting on competitors products expanding its market reach This is a genius strategy as it somewhat applies a modular approach to agricultureI also believe that this is a smart way of potentially grabbing market shareSpeaking of market share the company has a major focus on expanding the Fendt market share in North America and South AmericaThe company targets achieving 15 billion in Fendt sales by 2025 aiming to outpace industry growth by 4 to 5 annuallyAGCO believes that Fendts premium technology and high fuel efficiency have positioned it as a leading product capturing market share by appealing to growers seeking advanced technology and performanceThe strategy involves offering a full line of Fendt products including tractors sprayers combines and planters allowing dealers to provide comprehensive solutions to customersAs part of a potential pricing war the company will not lower prices on premium Fendt products but use Messey Ferguson to target farmers looking for lowerpriced productsIt will also make its dealer network more efficient which has been a reason why Deere has dominated the North American marketSo what about the dividendAGCO has a special dividend  literallyThe company currently pays a 029 per share per quarter dividend The yield is 097While this is low and nothing to get excited about theres good newsOn May 5 the company announced its highest special dividend ever of 500 per share This brings the total annualized dividend to 616 which translates to a 51 yield In other words AGCO could be a highyielding agriculture stock if it sticks to this policyFurthermore the companys net leverage ratio is just 02x EBITDA Next year the company is expected to end up with more cash than gross debtThe company has a BBB credit ratingSo what about the valuationThis is the tricky part According to analysts the companys growth streak is expected to end next year I disagree with that as I do not believe that the company is about to see two consecutive years of contraction  not unless we enter a steep recession with severely subdued crop prices Or if rates remain so high that farmers are unable to buy new equipment Rising rates are a major problemHaving said that expectations are that free cash flow remains close to 10 of its market cap This means that high special dividends are very likely unless the company engages in MA or decides to further enhance its already healthy balance sheetWith regard to the valuation rising EBITDA and an unchanged stock price since early 2021 have caused the valuation to drop to just 63x EBITDACurrently a lower valuation makes sense as investors arent willing to buy machinery stocks when global growth is in declineHowever AGCO benefits from strong secular tailwinds close to zero construction exposure and a solid strategy to gain market shareLongerterm I do not believe that AGCO should trade below 8x EBITDAThis would put the fair value at almost 190 per share 60 above the current pricePlease note that this is based on very conservative analyst estimates I would argue that the company could see 10 to 20 higher EBITDA in 2025Although I do not believe that AGCO will start this uptrend anytime soon on a longerterm basis the stock remains extremely undervaluedKnowing a bit about its top brands like Fendt I have no doubt that the company is in a great spot to take away market share Im not sure that a lot of it will come from Deere but in general AGCO is an increasing force to be reckoned withWhile Deere  Company remains my favorite dividend growth holding in the agriculture space AGCO has emerged as a competitor deserving of recognitionBoasting toptier tractor brands and advancing technologies AGCO is ready to take away market share from its peersDespite a dividend yield slightly below 1 the company offers juicy total yield potential especially during favorable economic timesWith a strong growth strategy and a focus on precision equipment AGCO is aggressively expanding its market share aiming for 1 billion in precision sales and a significant foothold for Fendt in North and South AmericaThe companys special dividend policy further enhances its appeal presenting a potentially significantly undervalued highyield investmentJoin  today to get the most indepth research that includes REITs mREITs

371,Super Micro Computer Q4 Earnings Review: Strong Demand Hampered By Supply Shortages,Super Micro Computer Inc  has been one of the hottest AI stocks of 2023 I initiated coverage of SMCI with a Strong Buy rating in late May stating that I had been building a positionLast quarter SMCI missed on EPS estimates and barely beat on revenue Throughout fiscal Q3 the company was grappling with unforeseen component shortages and yet the stock  following earnings SMCI CEO Charles Liang had this to say about fiscal Q3In this article Ill review again why SMCI is such a hot stock and review the recent earnings callDespite an overwhelmingly pessimistic attitude in markets throughout 2022 SMCI prevailed as one of the top performers This rampage has continued throughout 2023 with SMCI benefitting from the AIstock bull run As with most bull runs price behavior is somewhat estranged from business fundamentals which become overshadowed by growth expectations This is commonly known as a multiple expansion with common metrics like the pricetoearnings ratio growing significantly The trend in the multiple gives insight into investors expectations of future growth Stocks with higher growth expectations will trade at higher multiples Traditionally SMCI was a very low multiple company They were plagued by reputational issues throughout the 2010s with a  from Bloomberg causing years of underperformance The dust has settled here and years of investigations have yielded no major incriminating evidence against SMCI productsNow with AI reshaping the modern world attention on SMCI has exploded and the future looks promising SMCI builds supercomputers and sells them to companies for far cheaper TCO than if those companies attempted to build their own supercomputer Chip innovations typically feature either more computing power or energy efficiency improvements SMCI touts some of the most energyefficient server solutions on the market which will be a huge tailwind in the era of drastic increases in computing powerThis quarter my sentiment remains bullish for SMCI Despite a major beat in sales 218B vs 190B estimated and EPS 351 vs 257 estimated shares are getting pummeled and closed down almost 15 after hours following the earnings release Gross margin has decreased a few ticks from 176 last quarter to 170 now The drawdown in the stock is being caused by lower future guidance than the market had hoped forThe story is still overwhelmingly positive though in my view The company has a strong balance sheet with growing assets and shrinking liabilitiesWith a strong balance sheet aided by improvements in average days in inventory mentioned on the earnings call which was down 50 days this quarter In other words cash is growing debt shrinking and inventory is turning over faster Further management mentioned multiple times on the earnings call that topline growth was kept contained by a shortage of supply not demand While this is not ideal its better than the oppositeDespite the recent dramatic price drop the industryagnostic rush to incorporate generative AI into business operations will continue to provide a strong secular tailwind for SMCI I dont see any major reason for concern and believe this price behavior is shortterm In that light I added a few shares to my total position in afterhours trading which now brings my average cost to just over 175 per shareOf course investment is not without risk An investment below the 100 range was a safe bet but the valuation is much more extreme today With under 1B in annual profit paying 15B represents a PE of over 20 SMCI will need to continue rapidly growing amidst an increasingly competitive environment which is a tall task regardless of tailwindsFurther management exhaustively noted that there are component shortages They are dependent on key unnamed vendors and are not being entirely transparent on specifics Transparency is a huge benefit to companies so the lack thereof could cause concern Its most likely that the shortages are being caused by chip suppliers ramping up production of AIoptimized chips which are still relatively new to market There could be quality and yield issues but these should resolve themselves over time as suppliers build manufacturing capacity and expertiseTheres another risk that SMCIs servers become outright unnecessary in the market Some companies with sufficient financial resources have built their own computers using proprietary chip design cutting out suppliers like Nvidia for design and SMCI for plugandplay supercomputers A recent example is Tesla  and its supercomputer built on the Dojo architecture This strategy reflects what Apple did with its M1 chip line namely to internally design a chip and build a supercomputer on that chip Dojo chips feature an architecture colloquially known as systemonachip meaning instead of a typical computer that connects separate physical components the Dojo architecture has packed all necessary components onto a single chip This significantly increases the efficiency of the system overall and will be used for Tesla to train its FSD fullself driving AI modelFew companies have the technical and financial wherewithal to complete such a feat though Herein lies SMCIs core marketDespite the risks I do believe SMCI is a buy Using a discounted cashflow model I estimate SMCI to be worth around 245265 up from my previous estimate of 230250 based on a net income of about 640m In that light I believe SMCI is very slightly overvalued at the time of writing with the stock trading in the 270280 range I do believe the stock is still a Buy motivating my Buy rating because I use a very conservative terminal PE of 5 in my valuation With the current multiple exceeding 20 Ive built in a lot of room for multiple contraction Further I use far more conservative growth estimates 10 for 20232025 7 for 20262028 and 5 for 20292032 than management is guiding and use an aggressive discount rate of 15 far above the current 10year treasury yieldConsidering the risks I believe my model paints an accurate picture of SMCIs intrinsic value and believe that buying at the current price is a wise decision for longterm investors I do expect more volatility however 5 years from now I expect this stock to be much more richly valued than it is nowThe management team discussed a number of key points for the 2024 fiscal year on the call With AI establishing its roots throughout the modern world a key secular trend will be the increase in demand for highpowered computing Fabless chip companies many of whom SMCI has close working relationships with are rapidly innovating chip designs to increase computing power Alongside this hardware companies like SMCI are grappling with the challenge of keeping servers and supercomputers from overheating  is a somewhat nascent but promising product in this space though the majority of sales are still attributable to aircooled serversWhile innovation is a net benefit for data centers its increasing the complexity of the required infrastructure and is making it more burdensome for cloudservice providers  allows SMCI customers to enjoy industryleading timetomarket energy efficiency and total cost of ownershipManagement expects sustained growth in the TAM total addressable market driven by AI adoption as such they opened a new manufacturing facility today and have plans for another new facility in 2024 However it was noted multiple times that supply constraints are keeping total sales contained As with the demand for more computing power there will be a continuously growing demand for data storage Management noted they are not only focusing on building AI supercomputers but also highcapacity storage solutionsRounding out SMCIs offerings and the smallest business line by revenue is 5GIoTEdge computing solutions Although somewhat immaterial now at 2 of total revenue this business line should grow well into the future In summary SMCIs three current major product offerings are for 1 Artificial IntelligenceMachine LearningHighPerformance Computing 2 Storage and 3 5GInternet of ThingsEdge computing All three of these markets show promise for longterm growth CEO Charles Liang is very optimistic stating on the earnings call that he expects 20B in annual sales within a few yearsDespite a 400 runup in price and what some believe to be a bubble in AI stocks I am still rating SMCI stock a Buy I am fundamentally bullish on the company and believe it will continue to grow into the futureAs

372,Charting A Course In Choppier Waters,At the start of 2023 consensus expectations were decisively negative and reflected a high likelihood of a recession A string of positive economic surprises along with excitement around artificial intelligence AI fueled strong equity market performance throughoutNow market focus has started to shift towards concerns over policy rates remaining higher for longer While avoiding a recession still appears achievable alternative indicators suggest that economic surprises may become more twosided and could pose challenges to equity investors in the months ahead This also means that the ability to accurately forecast the direction of those surprises may be increasingly valuable for harnessing alpha opportunities as they surface In this quarters Systematic Equity Outlook we explore theEasing inflationary pressures and resilient growth measures were among the string of positive developments that strengthened the case for a US softlanding earlier this year Despite acknowledging progress on inflation the US Federal Reserve Fed continues to look for further evidence that policy is sufficiently restrictive to fully restore price stability The Fed raised the bar for rate cuts and signaled they may keep rates higher for longer with the September Summary of Economic Projections SEP prompting a repricing of policy expectationsSo can inflation continue to decline and provide the evidence needed to satisfy the Fed To answer this question we monitor a wide range of alternative datasets that provide a timely and granular view of inflation ahead of official reports For example we use data from online job postings to track wage inflation in real time Figure 1 shows a reacceleration of wage growth that we started to observe near the end of August Some official data releases like the September Jobs Report and JOLTS data have since shown signs of increased labor market strength and we expect other lagged measures to reflect higher wage growth in the coming monthsYearoveryear  wage inflationBeneath the surface of highlevel wage increases our job postings data also reveals an important shift in the distribution of wage inflation Figure 2 shows that the largest wage gains are concentrated in higherpaying occupations while wage gains for lowerpaying roles have been more muted This suggests that declines in wage inflation highlighted in many aggregate measures may be masking a more nuanced story of ongoing tightness in the labor market Our data shows that along with potentially reaccelerating in aggregate the wage inflation picture is becoming increasingly complex with growing divergence across occupation typesYearoveryear  change by occupation categoryIts important to note that the reacceleration of inflationary pressures appears to be confined to wages as alternative data measures across several other price components are showing continued progress on disinflation But given wages have been a key driver of stubborn services inflation especially the socalled supercore core services exshelter inflation now running back above 5 the Fed may feel added pressure to keep rates higher for longerThe strong job market is just one characteristic of the postpandemic economy thats contributed to resilient economic growth and inflation throughout the Feds hiking cycle The unprecedented level of pandemic stimulus is another factor thats bolstered household savings and supported strong consumer spending Among a wide range of stimulus initiatives student loan payments were paused from nearly the start of COVID19 through September 2023Now the resumption of student loan repayments could have the opposite effect on consumer activity To gauge the magnitude of potential impact we leverage US statelevel student loan and income data Figure 3 illustrates the aggregate student loan burden for each state suggesting that the resumption of repayments will likely have the largest impact on household balance sheets in lowerincome statesAggregate spending headwind vs posttax income by stateThe resumption of student loan payments also has the potential to drive increased labor participation as households face higher debt obligations The aggregate participation rate of highereducated cohorts remains below preCOVID levels suggesting that theres room for more normalization to occurIf this is the case the unemployment rate may increase due to rising labor participation as we saw in August While higher unemployment is typically perceived as a negative for the economy it may be viewed positively if its driven by an uptick in labor supply rather than broadbased layoffs This is because it could relieve wage pressures by further restoring balance between labor supply and demand without requiring widespread job losses and economic pain As shown in Figure 4 corporate layoff mentions across earnings calls and news articles have continued to moderate in recent months The absence of severe layoffs is one of several indicators suggesting that economic growth in the US remains stable enough to avoid a recession in the near termUnique mentions of layoffs in US largecap conference calls and Dow Jones news articlesIn recent months yield curve steepening has largely dominated equity returns putting downward pressure on valuations given higher discount rates Looking ahead its possible that equity beta could face some additional headwinds even if a recession is avoided This is because as the yield curve normalizes uninverts further  would take place Given that equity market pricing still reflects a largely optimistic growth outlook the effect of higher discount rates could once again dominate broad equity performance in the absence of a significantly positive growth shockAt the same time the alpha opportunity set for equity investors has become increasingly compelling Macroeconomic and market uncertainty is contributing to increased security dispersion or divergence in returns across individual stocks Active managers with the ability to rapidly uncover security selection insights and recalibrate portfolios may be wellpositioned to harness alpha opportunities amid heightened volatility This environment particularly enhances the opportunity set for managers who can invest both  as they can exploit performance differences across stocks and target returns in the crosssection of markets with reduced dependence on overall market directionThe AI theme is one area where we see crosssectional opportunities emerging In the first half of the year AI could be thought of as a rising tide that lifted most boats particularly in the megacap tech universe Now the surge in longterm rates has dampened the initial broad AI rally making individual company characteristics a more relevant return driver Some of the early AI leaders have differentiated themselves by starting to monetize the opportunity and delivering strong earnings results On the opposite end of the spectrum weve seen a reversal in the performance of certain companies that initially benefitted from the rising ride but havent shown evidence of sustained leadership potentialIts worth noting that within BlackRock Systematic we leverage  to help inform these security selection insights One example of this is our use of transformerbased models to analyze unstructured text at scale which provides a higher level of precision and accuracy than more traditional methods of analysisFor example we can analyze corporate earnings call transcripts from previous quarters throughout history to determine which companies were genuinely focused on AI long before the recent wave of hype From a broader industry perspective Figure 5 illustrates the acceleration of AIrelated job postings across the economy We can use the text from these online job postings to understand how companies across industries are integrating AI into their business models and the potential enhancements to productivity and efficiency that may followCumulative count of job postings over timeAfter a string of positive surprises in the first half of 2023 our outlook is becoming slightly more balanced as we look ahead Wage pressures and consumer spending headwinds may be emerging and equity markets could face periods of pressure from further curve steepening even if a softlanding is achieved Despite these risks increased security dispersion is enhancing the opportunity set for active managers to generate alpha amid choppier waters 2023 BlackRock Inc All rights

373,Maersk Doesn't Need A Soft Landing To Be A Great Investment,AP Møller  Mærsk AS  or more commonly known as just Maersk is one of the largest container shipping companies in the world and has its hand in nearly 16 of global trade withOne thing that catches my attention every now and then is  and his adoption of bulk shipping companies from time to timeNo Michael Burry did not buy Maersk but this past quarter he did start small positions in several shipping companies  Safe Bulkers  Euronav  Costamare  and Star Bulk Carriers  This basket of shipping companies reminds me a lot of his old trade in Golden Ocean  from a couple of years ago which was highly successful After I decided to start a recent position in Maersk I noticed the 13F filings were starting to come out so I took a look at Burrys recent changes to his portfolio I noticed he was also buying shipping companies during the quarter which was a welcome surprise but also most likely just a random coincidence of market timingBurrys trading style is a bit hard to follow because usually his holdings turn over every quarter or two and he trades at a fast pace which can be hard to draw any conclusions from Earlier this year he bought a bunch of US bank stocks and was out of them by the very next quarter Michael Burry is not a Warren Buffett buyandhold forever type of investor but what can value investors learn from his portfolio What can be useful to investors from watching Burrys portfolio over time is learning  and seeing when he enters into a trade and what  he chooses to focus on and come back to time and time again Could it be the right time to buy into the shipping cycle now Or is Burry simply making a macro bet on a soft landing with a basket of shipping companiesJust recently on September 18th 2023 J Zim Integrated Shipping  citing margin declines as temporary with a rebound being likely as COVIDera charters get rechartered or redelivered at cheaper rates If an economic soft landing is perhaps in the cards after all shipping stocks such as Maersk are sure not trading like itWhatever the case may be I see Maersk as somewhat the opposite of what Michael Burry would typically buy in the industry The market capitalization and sheer size of the company is not like him at all Burry typically trades small caps or even borderline microcap shipping companies with a short time horizon but I intend to do the opposite My goal is to not trade the stock in the short term but hold Maersk for much longer reinvesting the dividends along the wayI like Maersk simply because it is a massive company in its industry with a competitive advantage trading at a large discount to book value with potential for outsized returns from stock buybacks over time It is unusual to find a company with such a huge market presence that trades at nearly half of book value even if this is the shipping industry we are talking about here The potential returns from just buybacks in future years are significant but combined with dividend reinvestment over time I think the stock could be a worthy compounderIn this article I will outline the basic thesis for investing in Maersk stock and explain why buying at nearly half of book value makes sense given the buyback strategyMaersk trades at roughly 05x book value and also at historically low levels when isolating for this variable even slightly below the COVID crash levels of March 2020Most of the  seem very low but the recent PE ratio of the stock is somewhat misleading due to cyclical reasons and the recent years of earnings being abnormally good for the company I would not go from just the recent earnings of the prior two years but use other variables to determine if the stock really is as cheap as it currently appears to beA PE multiple for 2023 is estimated to be around 7x which seems more inline with a fair valuation but earnings could be better than expected next year even if a soft landing for the economy is not in the cards The most recent earnings call shed light on this as management stated that while  on the industry earnings guidance would be better than expected for the full year Sort of contradictory statements but better earnings for the full year would translate to possibly better dividends than expected as well Recent declining financial results since 2022 and a big crash earlier this year have both pushed the stock from near record highs back to test a support level near 800 for the ADR which trades as AMKBY I like the stock here around this price as the discount to book value should not be viewed as a weakness but rather as a support level and buying opportunity for those with a longerterm mindsetFor me Maersk seems like a relatively safe way to make a macro bet on the economy and collect dividends along the way When I look at companies like this I always try to screen for low valuations a competitive advantage nice margin of safety and if possible potential for reinvestment of dividends each year Shipping companies can be tricky because they are cyclical with highly variable earnings and dividends which are usually not consistent This makes valuing the company difficult based off of EPS aloneMaersk paid a  in March which will likely not stay high again next year Even with a big drop in the dividend yield being pricedin the recent action in the stock does not worry me I would rather see management prioritize stock buybacks over dividends anyway at this time as the discount to book means that more value likely can be created from these buybacks over the next few years rather than paid out as dividends to shareholdersThe future dividend yield is somewhat uncertain but nevertheless it helps in terms of offsetting the downside that may be apparent in the next 6 months Could the stock get even cheaper and trade for under 05x book given a hard landing for the economy Yes I believe that anything is possible but this could be a necessary outcome to create future value from buybacks at rock bottom prices before the cycle inevitably turns positive once moreMaking macro bets directly via complicated strategies and hedging is not my style as an investor However investing in Maersk seems like a good way to have some protection against the downside while making a largely macro bet on the economyThe thing that stood out to me right away in my research into the company was how surprisingly good the balance sheet was Maersk does not have too much debt and the company has tons of cash which can be used to buy back stock at discounted prices to book valueThis alone will create value for shareholders over time in my opinion but there is some risk that management may prioritize dividends over buybacks in the next couple years make acquisitions or change the capital allocation strategy in some other way which could hinder performanceShown above is the companys balance sheet from the  Maersk has over 10 billion in cash and around 14 billion in total noncurrent liabilities Compare the debt with the total equity at 56 billion and the debttoequity ratio is close to 025Comparing the cash position to the market cap at around 29 billion and it becomes clear just how much buyback potential there is over the next several years Buybacks have already been aggressive and management seems committed to this strategy as the stock price has declined in recent monthsWhen considering certain stocks like Maersk as an investment one should ask themselves how am I going to get to my desired return For some stocks it is clear that growth in some capacity is going to be a main factor while in other stocks a lot of the return comes from dividends What if the company is not growing at all Are multiples expanding or contracting In many cases returns will come from four things  dividends multiple expansion earnings growth and stock buybacks Reversion to the mean is always something that must be considered especially with cyclical companies like Maersk Timing the cycles can be difficult and so a longerterm approach is necessary to produce favorable results Trading these stocks in the short term is possible but it is risky and does not always guarantee that dividends will contribute to the returnOne possible place the return could come from would be simply from a reversion to the mean in terms of book value In my opinion it is somewhat more likely that Maersk could become loved by the market once more in the next cycle and trade closer to 1x book value rather than the stock getting punished even further to trade in a range near 025x book value from 05x book value A risk is that given a bad enough recession todays prices could be too high compared to future earnings potentialAnother place the return could come from would be the combination of two factors  one being dividends reinvested over each year of the holding period and managements commitment to stock repurchases going even higher over the next several years The results of the buyback program are already exceptional as the number of shares outstanding  from 21 million as of 2019 to almost 17 million as of this year Aggressive buybacks are one thing but buying back stock at major discounts to book value is an overlooked mechanism that could supercharge future returns Dividends will likely not be very large next year but reinvesting the dividends at opportune moments in future years will be important to the longerterm strategy of holding the stock through various parts of the cycleThe last place the return could come from could be the most overlooked of them all  actual unexpected economic growth in future years and Maersk being rerated with a higher multiple compared to similar players in the industry The company has an excellent balance sheet so it would not be a shock to see the stock trade at a premium to book value at some point in the future when the cycle inevitably revertsShipping companies are widely known for their cyclicality In good times the earnings and dividends will be astronomical but in bad times shipping rates decline and the company struggles to make any profits at all Similar to the semiconductor cycle the market goes through ups and downs as conditions with pricing change One year a certain company in a cyclical industry has high margins and earns record profits the next year the margins are terrible and the company barely makes any money at all This can be a problem for many shipping companies that use excessive leverage to build their fleets as the downturns can be worse than expected causing financial difficulty and instability In my opinion Maersk does not use excessive leverage but this is still a risk which should be considered before making an investment in the companyIt is also important for investors to realize that Maersks earnings potential and dividends in a given year are closely tied to shipping rates which are highly volatile In terms of recent years the postpandemic environment caused demand to skyrocket and many bulk shipping companies looked dirt cheap compared to what they were trading for in the middle of 2020 Now that this postpandemic rush has subsided for the most part supply and demand are beginning to look more balanced Investing in shipping companies is notoriously tricky as timing the cycles becomes more important than other aspects of the business itself and being on the right side of the cycle is easier said than doneAP Møller  Mærsk AS or simply just Maersk is a relatively safe way to make a macro bet on global trade with a further advantage given due to a margin of safety with shares trading at nearly half of book value This relative safety stems from managing downside risk with high dividends and the potential for future returns stemming from sizeable stock buybacks over time The company has an excellent balance sheet and a commanding market position with a market share of around 17 giving a competitive advantage in the shipping industry The valuation is extremely favorable with a low PE multiple and shares at nearly 05x book value which makes managements buyback strategy even more enticing for longerterm investors A soft landing for the economy would be an amazing outcome but this is not entirely necessary for Maersk stock to produce favorable returns in future years I currently view shares of Maersk as a Buy at this time and will be watching the stock closely for continued buying opportunities in the 800900 range for the ADREditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that

374,STAG Industrial: Cost Of Capital Exceeds The Cap Rate - Shares Untimely,One of the salient features of REITs is that profits and prices often move in cycles And there are two cycles worth considering First there is the space market cycle which describes the supply and demand for a type ofSTAG enjoys a BBB rating from Fitch and a Baa3 from Moodys Both credit agencies have stable outlooks for STAG Please take a look at Table 1 which compares the total return that can be earned from an equity interest in STAG and the 5year median yield on the Corporate BaaBBBFinance is based on several fundamental precepts one of which is a balance of risk and return When you can earn 94 basis points more in an instrument that has less risk it may be time to reevaluate the investment thesis for a stockIn economic theory when a business can deploy assets and earn a return that exceeds the cost to acquire the assets then value is created In the case of a REIT value is created when the capitalization rate or cap rate exceeds the cost of capital The cap rate is the net operating income obtained from the assets and the cost of capital is the cost to use capital to purchase the assets for which income is generated This is especially important for a REIT because they are not able to retain earnings and have to rely on capital markets to fund their growth In general REITs tap debt and equity markets to fund acquisitions for growth and to refinance debt as they come dueLet us now evaluate how much value is created by looking at the difference between the cap rate and the cost of capital for STAG Please take a look at Table 2The cap rate presented is the midpoint of the guided stabilized cap rate in STAGs Q2 2023 Earnings Supplement For STAG to create value their cost of capital must be less than this figureIn order to calculate the cost of capital we have to calculate the cost of debt the cost of equity and weigh each cost to the extent they are used in the business Let us review the capital structure to see how much debt versus equity is being employed by STAG Please take a look at Table 3STAG does not currently have any preferred shares outstandingNow that we have the relative weights we now look at each source of capital and estimate the cost Please take a look at Table 4 for the cost of equityThere are different methods and philosophies around calculating the cost of equity We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM in which we essentially add a spread to the riskfree rate and scale the spread by the volatility of the particular stockThe beta statistic measures the volatility with respect to the market The beta is 092 which implies that STAGs stock is less sensitive than the market Conceptually this is justified because REITs as an asset class generally have revenue streams that are contractual and more stable than nonREITs I use the 10year treasury as my riskfree rate and apply a spread or an equity risk premium of 438 The equity risk premium I used is from  The cost of equity arrived at using this approach is 826 STAG would have to offer an 826 return to entice equity investors to purchase shares by this estimateNow that we have a cost of equity let us now estimate the cost of debt Please take look at Table 5 in which we provide the issuer rating for STAG as before and the 10year Corporate BaaBBB median yieldThe implication of the cost of debt is that should STAG wish to refinance debt at about the 10year tenor it would be facing a cost of debt of 570 This does not mean that their interest expense is going to be exactly 570 of their longterm debt because some fixedrate debt could have originated at a different time when interest rates were lower Because of this the actual cost of debt may be somewhat less In general businesses will be slow to refinance debt in an inflationary environment to take advantage of previous interest rate regimes and will be quick to refinance debt in a declining interest rate environment to take advantage of lower available interest rates STAG also employs swaps to manage their interest rate exposure Nevertheless for our purposes 570 is the most accurate reflection of the current market conditions and so we will use this as our inputNow that we have a cost of debt the cost of equity and the weights of each in the capital structure we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital Please take a look at Table 6The tax shield normally included in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital is ignored because REITs generally do not pay taxes at the corporate levelTaking into account the current macroeconomic environment STAG would have to generate a cap rate of more than 757 to create economic profit In Table 7 we quantify the amount of the deficit between cap rate and the weighted average cost of capital for STAGThe calculation indicates that STAG does not create value as measured by this framework Let us explore further why this may the case We have looked at the spread between the cap rate and the cost of capital for STAG Let us take a broader perspective and look at the spread between the Industrial REIT cap rate and the 10year treasury from 20102019 Please take a look at Table 8In Table 9 we look at the spread as of the second quarter of this yearThe 63basis point spread as of the second quarter is beyond two standard deviations from the mean spread from 2010 to 2019 These figures suggest that cap rates have yet to meaningfully adjust upwards In the recent earnings call STAGs leadership The commentary suggests that sellers still have in their recent memory high asset prices that were reflective of a low interest environment There seems to be some hesitancy on their part to accept the new market environment When sellers reduce the price that will potentially increase cap rates in deals moving forwardFor cap rates to increase either the net operating income has to increase or the asset values have to come down One way for net operating income to increase is when leases come up for renewal they are released at a higher contractual base rent which is reflective of the current market conditions For the second quarter renewals showed a cash rent change of 283 which was higher than the yeartosecond quarter rent change of 235 suggesting an accelerating trend The comparable statistics for 2022 were 137 and 112 respectivelyAnother way for cap rates to increase is if asset prices come down Asset prices coming down may seem like a positive development for an acquirer such as STAG but it could also put a dampening effect on STAGs stock price as their current portfolio will potentially be valued lessFinally operating performance would be impacted About 174 of their debt principal balance has a maturity date on or before June 2025 which implies meaningful refinance activity in the near term Additionally interest expense for the first six months of 2023 was 293 higher than the comparable period in 2022 Debt was only 1288 higher during the period by my estimate If more of the pie is going to fixed income holders there is less available for equity investorsLet us look into the operating performance in more detailPlease take a look at Table 10 in which we compare the per share metrics for the first six months of this year with the first six months of 2018Looking at the metrics it appears that even with the current inflationary environment STAGs performance is better than it was in the first six months of 2018 This is the sort of fiveyear performance you would expect from a REIT in a stable interest rate environment In 2018 the 10year treasury was hovering around 290 and it is at 424 today Let us look at this in more detailThe metrics presented in Table 10 are per share metrics for the first six months of the respective year Let us look at the share count growth from 2018 to 2023 To maintain consistency the share count is as of the second quarter of each year not yearend Please take a look at Table 11Share count growth showed an increasing trend from 20182020 and then dropped to about a third of the pace in 2021 and then showed an increase in 2022 and then slowed to a crawl in 2023 My first impression from overall cadence of share issuance is that management is adroit in issuing shares and units when the environment is favorableThe second impression is that the miniscule growth in share issuance in the first half of 2023 is not sustainable REITs are not able to retain earnings to a meaningful extent so they have to issue shares regularly to fund growth The slow share count growth in the first six months of 2023 is probably a reflection of the unfavorable market conditions that exist in acquiring assets When a healthy spread exists between the cap rate and the cost of capital that would be an opportune time to issue shares and fund growth There is another dimension to this which may be of potential concern to investorsBecause the per share data for the first six months of 2023 as presented in Table 10 does not reflect the historic pace of share issuance as we have seen from Table 11 investors should contemplate on how accurate the performance comparison between the two time periods really is Had share issuance continued at its average pace in the first six months of this year the period comparison would probably favor the 2018 performance Additionally while management strategy of holding back on share issuance until a balance between cap rate and cost of capital is sensible it may portend an accelerated pace of share issuance with its dilutive effectWhen the fixed income instrument of an issuer can offer a return that exceeds the dividend yield  growth rate the investment thesis of the stock has to be revisited In revisiting the worthiness of the investment we have raised some questions as to the timeliness of an investment in STAGs stockFirstly there is an imbalance between the cap rate and the cost of capital Investors should consider waiting until a positive spread is restored and value creation is demonstrated by figures Secondly if and when cap rates adjust upwards there could be downward pressure of real estate asset prices STAGs current portfolio would be potentially valued less which may negate some of benefit of the cap rate improvement Thirdly the per share performance in the first half of 2023 is not reflective of performance under the normal pace of share issuance When share issuance resumes at its historic pace operating metrics may compare unfavorably to past periods which may dampen stock prices Lastly as debt matures and requires refinancing increased interest expense will make it less likely that future dividends can grow at an attractive clipPrudent investors should consider foregoing an investment in STAG at the current time   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable

375,SolarEdge: Eager To Buy The Bottom,With the levelized cost of solar now lower than all other sources of energy the companies which stand to benefit the most from its adoption face sustained tailwinds Because I believe the panels have been commoditized II believe SolarEdge Technologies Inc  is an attractive picksandshovels play They are currently facing both shortterm headwinds and longterm tailwinds this is likely to produce a buying opportunity After looking over the state of their industry and its present inventory problems and juxtaposing that against their financials and valuation I presently rate SolarEdge as a HoldSolarEdge Technologies Inc is a developer of support infrastructure for the photovoltaic industry Their products and services includeAs of late 2021 SolarEdge and Enphase   of the global inverter market share Last week I wrote an article explaining why  to benefit from the low levelized cost of photovoltaics However they are not alone SolarEdge has successfully tackled the same problem with a different approachWith a traditional string inverter if even one panel on a string becomes shaded the output voltage is unlikely to be able to overcome grid voltage so the energy produced would likely be wasted Back before I got my bachelors I spent some time doing photovoltaic installations This was before microinverters and power optimizers were common and often homeowners didnt understand the importance of keeping their panels clear of debris Because they were wired in series I used to tell people that shading even a single panel in a string is comparable to kinking a garden hose the shaded panel is no longer a good conductor of electricity and cripples the output of the entire stringWithout solving this shading problem systems which use traditional string inverters produce less total power over the life of the system They also have their panels faced to the same tilt and azimuth angle so the panels all receive the same amount of insolation Anytime the panels produce a dissimilar amount of output from the rest of its string waste is introduced into the systemSolarEdge tackles this problem by attaching a power optimizer to each panel These optimizers regulate the panel output on an individual level before sending the energy to an inverter A significant advantage this has over the decentralized microinverter systems that Enphase uses is that SolarEdge inverters can be mounted in more easily accessible locationsThe global solar panel market is projected to maintain a  through 2030 The global microinverter market is expected to have a  until 2028Several years ago the  fell below the cost of nonrenewables More recently it has even fallen below the cost of windOur projections for the maximum rate of solar adoption have always been affected by the pace we can adapt our grid to one that is capable of handling large amounts of intermittent sources Our current grid does not contain enough storage As we include more photovoltaics into our system they warp the supply and demand curve more and more We refer to this warping as the Duck Curve To prevent damage to parts of the grid commercial scale operations are forced to disconnect portions of their system during the overproduction that occurs in the middle of every dayThe ultra cheap cost of solar is shifting our incentives around storage to the point that we are now looking at new battery types Specifically  of ironair batteries is currently in the works Ironair batteries are not a new technology but have always been overlooked because of their lessthanideal performance characteristics However they are significantly less expensive to produce than Liion The low cost and abundance of iron means sourcing enough metal for a widespread adoption of grid scale storage should no longer be a problemTheir most recent earnings call transcript indicates that SolarEdge is experiencing the same issues with inventory that Enphase is Both companies are facing a situation where demand is curtailing and the supply chain between them and their end use customers is already rather fullThey expect the current inventory adjustment period to continue for the next two quarters in Europe In the United States they expect it to last at least through the end of the year Globally they are taking a mixed outlook as not all markets are currently being crippled by higher interest rates They cited South Africa and Thailand as both witnessing high demand and growth because of a combination of grid instability and favorable local regulationsBefore diving into their annual financials I have to note that this company shifted its fiscal reporting cycle in 2016 Before then annual reports were released in June instead of December The strong tailwinds caused by the low cost of solar have been providing SolarEdge with revenue increases In 2013 they had an annual revenue of 1332M by 2022 that had increased to 31103M This represents a total increase of 22351 at an average annual rate of 2483Their margins were fairly stable from 2015 to 2019 before experiencing a contraction They appear to be maintaining a new range since 2019 As of the most recent annual report gross margins were 2715 EBITDA margins were 1068 operating margins were 909 and net margins were 302Their pace of dilution is unappealing Because it also came with significant increases in revenue and income I view it as accretive Total common shares outstanding was at 28M in 2013 by the end of 2022 that had risen to 561M This represents a 19036 rise in share count which comes out to an average annual rate of 2115 Over that same period operating income rose from 184M to 2827MOverall their debt situation is healthy As of the 2022 annual report they only had 49M in net interest expense total debt was 7355M and longterm debt was 6245MAlthough their income is quite healthy their cash flow situation is far from ideal SolarEdge has suffered from negative cash flow for the last three years As of this most recent annual report cash and equivalents was 7831M shortterm investments were 2411M operating income was 2827M EBITDA was 3323M net income was 938M unlevered free cash flow was 2997M and levered free cash flow was 3012MTheir annual total equity has been growingThe values for their returns for 2013 are skewing the chart so Im going to treat them as outliers and scrub themBy replacing their figures for 2013 with zeros we can see the trends that have been established since then SolarEdge was maintaining annual ROIC values above 20 but they have been dropping since 2020 As of the most recent annual report ROIC was 322 ROCE was 680 and ROE was at 431Their quarterly financials are showing strong revenue growth Eight quarters ago SolarEdge had a quarterly revenue of 4801M Four quarters ago that had grown to 7278M by this most recent quarter that had risen again this time to 9913M This represents a total twoyear increase of 1065 and an average quarterly rate of 1331Their margins experienced an expansion in early 2021 This was followed by a contraction which found a low in Q2 2022 They have since reexpanded As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 3201 EBITDA margins were 165 operating margins were 1517 and net margins were at 1205Their dilution rate appears to have dropped The sum of their last eight quarters of dilution comes to 803 over the last four quarters this has dropped to 179Their debt situation continues to stay healthy This most recent quarter the income from their shortterm investments overcame their interest expenses SolarEdge had 34M in quarterly net interest expense total debt was at 735M and longterm debt was at 6259MAs of the most recent quarter cash and equivalents was 558M short term investments was 4932M EBITDA was 1636M operating income was 150M net income was 1195M unlevered free cash flow was at 2093M and levered free cash flow was at 2093MEven when looked at on a quarterly basis total equity continues to riseBoth mirroring and lagging what happened to their margins their returns experienced a contraction in 2022 before expanding in the first half of 2023 As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was 367 ROCE was 328 and ROE was at 474On August 14th 2023 SolarEdge had a market capitalization of 997B and traded for 17700 per share They do not pay a dividend so using their  of 2616x and their EPS  of 2851 I calculated a PEGY of 0918x and an Inverted PEGY of 1090x As this PEGY value is slightly below 1 and implies a fair value estimate of around 19290 per share I currently view the company as slightly undervaluedSolarEdge is currently suffering from a curtailing of demand as a result of elevated interest rates New solar installations have high upfront expenses and are frequently funded through loans Interest rates are currently being maintained at an elevated rate to fight against inflation The Fed has made it clear that they are  to beat inflation back down I expect that demand for new solar installations will stay suppressed for as long as rates stay elevatedThe photovoltaic industry and its ancillaries exist in a highcompetition environment The fact that panels have become so cheap and are being commoditized and yet inverters have yet to means that this industry may face increasing competitive pressure from outside players The duopoly that Enphase and SolarEdge currently enjoy could be challenged by another company such as Tesla  which was  of market shareThe inverter industry is currently facing headwinds from elevated interest rates I expect that when rates eventually go down demand will elevate In addition to demand finding a new normal the industry may even experience a wave of pentup demand once the rates begin loweringAs cheaper batteries are manufactured at scale and the cost of grid storage goes down demand for solar should continue rising I believe demand for inverters will stay roughly correlated with demand for photovoltaics so I view the lowering cost of storage as a boon for SolarEdgeSolarEdge has a clear moat and exists as half of a duopoly in an industry with sustained tailwinds They have been experiencing fantastic revenue growth Their annual margins and returns have been contracting over the last several years If it wasnt paired with excellent growth I would be concerned about their negative cash flow Overall this company appears to be in a situation where its being forced to grow quickly to meet demand If it is ever unable to keep up it faces the prospect of losing market shareThe current macro situation is the only thing preventing me from placing a buy recommendation on SolarEdge The inventory glut the industry is faced with is projected to last at least two more quarters I believe this means that valuations in the inverter industry may continue dropping Anyone experiencing FOMO is unlikely to be burned by beginning a regime of dollar cost averaging now but I believe that I may be presented with a better buying opportunity if I waitIf I were wanting to enter a trade based on my conclusion that the inverter industry is likely to experience continued pressure for as long as the Fed maintains rates at an elevated level I would first look at front put ratio spreads Before I proceed with an example I should state a warning that new options traders frequently misunderstand their nonlinear behavior As with all new strategies paper trading until one is comfortable with it is advisableAfter examining a couple of 2leg strategies I eventually chose to move to a 3leg strategy so I could move the breakeven lower There are many different ways to set these up so dont feel like the strikes and expirations I chose are the only correct way to do thisThe first leg is a long put with a strike below the current share price and almost a year of time on it The second leg is selling a put with the same expiration but a strike that is chosen so the premium value is slightly more than half of the cost of the first leg The third leg consists of two puts each chosen so that the sum of their premiums is also a little more than half of the cost of the first leg The idea here is that the second and third legs more than pay for the first leg yet the first leg gains in value as the price goes down so it pushes the breakeven below all the strikesIf the expiration arrives next June and SEDG is trading above 170 the trade nets a 190 net profit Between 140 per share and 170 per share the trade pays out an increasing amount as it goes down It pays a maximum payout of 3190 between 110 and 140 Below 110 the profits begin to vanish and reach negative after the breakeven of 9404 Considering my fair value estimate for the company 19290 per share is 10513 above this breakeven I view this trade as having a significant margin of safetyIf a perceived bottom is reached before the expiration the long put with a strike of 170 can be sold or rolled for a gain and converted into more shares While the goal is to get handed shares as cheaply as possible if the share price goes up the trade can still be closed for a small gainAlthough I view this as a lowrisk trade it is not zero risk It is possible the fundamentals of the company are altered to the point that its fair value estimate is lowered This has the potential to shrink or even vanish away the margin of safety I have to be clear that my attitude on this spread is based on the conclusion that although their industry is dealing with shortterm headwinds they are only temporary and their longterm tailwinds will eventually overcome them   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a
