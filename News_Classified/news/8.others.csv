0,LVMH/Christian Dior: All Things Luxury Showing A Buy Setup,There are moments when the market will present a setup in rather clear fashion Of course we must always use proper risk management But when the chart shows us aChristian Dior Fendi Givenchy TAG Heuer Bulgari and many more In fact the two tickers mentioned here   and   aka DIOR represent more than 75 different wellknown luxury brands Also remember that DIOR holds 4236 shares and 5901 of voting rights within LVMH Thats why their current respective setups are so synonymous with each otherLets look at the Fundamental snapshot firstHere are some recent comments from our lead fundamental analyst Lyn AldenWe can also see from the attached charts below that while luxury is certainly not cheap the profit margins are still wide Not often Perhaps there will be a time in the future when these very luxury goods are priced at a lower valuation However the charts are not showing that to be the current case So with the supposition in hand that the luxury goods sector will strike a higher price over the next several months what is the setup and how can we define our risk vs rewardGarrett has been watching the LVMH chart with keen interest as of late we are sharing the DIOR chart as well but remember the crossover between the two tickers mentioned above Lets focus on the LVMH chart Both the Blue and Red paths point higher over the next several months The difference will be the depth of the correction ifwhen the next peak in price is struck as illustratedFor now we can focus on the nearterm completion of what is labeled as wave v of the circle c of wave 4 That is nearing fruition shortly or perhaps has even finished the corrective move with todays low If so then price should reverse from this area and then break above the 820 area We are looking for the 975 zone overhead to complete a much larger rally structure should price move below 660 first before forming this higher high anticipated then we would reassess the bullish setup as presentedIn the bigger picture this next high should be significant Why do we make that affirmation Its a matter of degreesPerhaps another way to describe the use of degree in this context is to compare it with scale The markets display selfsimilarity of structure at all degrees or scales of time This is the fractal nature of the markets These structures or patterns repeat at all scales or degrees and therefore can provide us with predictabilityThis is the power of Elliott Wave theory when correctly applied Lets simply discuss this using the Blue path illustrated on the above chart for LVMHNote at the next anticipated high there is a stack of 3 numbers What is this It is the confluence of degrees the one above greater than the prior and it tells us that the next high will be of even more importance than the prior high Why Because it will be at a higher degreeThis will be the confluence of 5 waves up from the low struck at wave 4 in June 2022 This wave 5 rally up is formed in 5 waves But the larger structure is also 5 waves Whats more its part of an even bigger 5 wave structure Now dont let this blow your mind Fractals are all around us in mathematics and even natureAvi Gilburt has discussed this in depth across many articles presented here for the readership Here is a brief excerpt from one of those pieces that discusses the theoryThere are many ways to analyze and track stocks and the market they form Some are more consistent than others For us this method has proved the most reliable and keeps us on the right side of the trade much more often than not Nothing is perfect in this world but for those looking to open their eyes to a new universe of trading and investing why not consider studying this further It may just be one of the most illuminating projects you undertakeEditors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks,20,2023-09-05,8
1,Looking To Participate In India's Growth? Try Bajaj Finance,Indias economic growth rate is anticipated to be in the 67 range year over year into the 20262027 time frame  The Economic Times If thats a market that youre looking to participate in then consider Bajaj Finance has their latest annual report available on their website  A few key metrics are revenue growth and then of course profits from that revenue Note some snapshots belowTake a deeper dive into their annual report for many more details and forwardlooking statements Bajaj Finance looks wellpositioned to capture much of this future growth And as Lyn mentions above the financial sector is likely to expand faster than the broad economy If so what are the price targets overhead for the stock And what would be a warning that our primary scenario is not playing out as illustratedAs you can see on the above chart Garrett shows that Bajaj stock should be working on a corrective retrace off the July high and setting up further upside into the end of the year as long as support holds This next rally phase may target as high as 10000 on the chart Should price instead break back below 6000 this would be a warning that our primary assessment may not be playing out as drawn up hereBajaj Finance stock is just one of the many that we follow At this time it would appear to have one of the stronger setups for higher into the end of 2023 Why can we make this projectionThe 10000 price target overhead is projected from the low struck way back in March 2009 The initial rally took price to the 84 level by the Fall of 2010 Thereafter a pullback low was found at 56 a year later To properly project the price target overhead you must use a chart with logarithmic scaling linear scaling will not correctly show the percentages of the rallies and pullbacksNow what makes this so intriguing is that the smaller rallies and pullbacks must also fit into the larger structure This is the fractal nature of markets The term fractal is attributed to a mathematician named Benoit Mandelbrot perhaps around the year 1975 But the fractal nature of the markets was observed and understood much before that time Avi Gilburt has written extensively about this and how it forms the basis of our analysis methodology Here is an excerpt from one of those articlesIf you have ever spent a few moments or even more observing a fractal it can almost be mindboggling The closer you zoom into a new shape the more you realize that it is exactly the same as the larger shape At your leisure Google fractals and then images Take a bit of a dive down that rabbit hole just make sure to tie a cord to reality to find your way out again It can make for a fascinating study into how fractals are all around us in nature in mathematics and yes in the stock marketsThe practical application for us as investorstraders is that the fractal nature of the markets provides us with a repeating and therefore predictable pattern that we can use to show a structure of price on any chart That structure of price can then illustrate risk vs rewardIn the specific case of Bajaj Finance we show important support at the 6000 level For as long as price remains at the level or above we can project a probable path forward to the 10000 area nextThere are many ways to analyze and track stocks and the market they form Some are more consistent than others For us this method has proved the most reliable and keeps us on the right side of the trade much more often than not Nothing is perfect in this world but for those looking to open their eyes to a new universe of trading and investing why not consider studying this further It may just be one of the most illuminating projects you undertake   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a ,14,2023-08-08,3
2,Toyota: Risk Of A Value Trap Rising,While the  managed a meager 2 gain in the same time frame Toyota  has run some 30plus We talked about this setup back at theToyota is now nearing what may be a major peak in price Yes according to the chart we share below there may be a few more squiggles higher in the months to come But its now time to tighten up risk management We provide the following updated commentary regarding the fundamentalsHere are Lyns comments from the May articleAnd today what may be a major factor in the shift to a value trapThe value trap thesis will likely begin to gain traction as Toyotas market share is challenged by these competitors So how will we know when the peak of the mountain has been reached And is there a way to track the structure of price on the chart to provide risk vs reward for a traderinvestorYes fundamentals are important and at some moment in time they will matter Whats more the smaller the market capitalization of the stock observed the more fundamentals will weigh on price The opposite also is true Sentiment works on a continuum And sentiment is what truly moves markets When we use the word sentiment its simply fear and greed Basic human behavior and feelings manifested right before our eyes in the price on the chartSo how do we use these feelings to our benefit rather than to our detriment Our job as market participants is to join in the movement of price and to be on the right side of that more often than not Seems simple and straightforward does it not However when greed and fear overtake a participant then said person is no longer an observer of the sentiment in the marketplace rather theyre now a participant in the sentiment itself Emotions have now clouded their judgement and objectivity will likely soon exit stage rightThe traderinvestor needs a specific structure to measure sentiment and to indicate whats the most likely path going forward We view the markets and the stocks that make them up from a probabilistic vantage point This means that we seek to identify what is the highest probability outcome and then follow this as our primary path We also will outline an alternative path should our primary failGarrett is a senior analyst covering both US and international equity indices as well as stocks Hes a key contributor of SP 500 and other index analysis We cover 10 international indices FTSE100 DAX Euro STOXX 50 Nikkei Hang Seng Indias Nifty 50 Mexicos IPC Index Brazils Bovespa Australias ASX 200  Shanghai Composite as well as many key stocks from around the globeToyota is part of this ongoing coverage The latest chart from GarrettIf you were following this chart from back in May then you will notice that price did not reach a substantially lower low but rather turned up and rallied more than 30 This was something that we were keenly aware of as a possibility and members were alerted back in midJune that a more bullish outcome was becoming more probableRemember that markets are nonlinear fluid and dynamic in nature much like human behavior Or rather exactly like human behavior So where does this place us nowAs you can see on the latest chart price should hold in this current area and turn up for one last rally phase to reach the 3000plus level Its plausible to see price as already having struck an important high at the 2900 level But support remains intact for the moment Should price move below 2400 that would be the first indication that 2900 is actually a more important high And a move below 2100 would make that more likelyThe risk of Toyota becoming a value trap is rising Once price completes this current rally structure we will turn more defensive Whats more this may even provide a sell setup in the near future For now we will eye a higher high but remain vigilant should support give wayThere are many ways to analyze and track stocks and the market they form Some are more consistent than oth,2,2023-10-02,8
3,Sentiment Speaks: The Market Got It Wrong,As we look back upon another interesting week in the market there are a few standout matters I would like to point outTo begin with I saw the following quote from an interview with wellknown economist Austan GoolsbeeMr Goolsbees quote evidenced his ignorance of certain market dynamics First this selloff was not at all a puzzle as the setup for it was developing weeks ago as I have outlined in public articles But you will not be able to identify these types of movements based on traditional economics As Benoit Mandelbrot outright stated one cannot reasonably apply an economic model to the financial marketsSecond the Fed does not control the market as many seem to believe If it were true then the market would not have been rallying to 4607 over this last year In fact that rally took Mr Goolsbee and most other economists by surprise as wellAs I have often said while news can act as a catalyst the substance of the news is not really material to the direction of the market move While many market watchers superficially believe that the substance of a news announcement determines the direction of a market move they often ignore the many times the market moves in the opposite direction of expectations And here Mr Goolsbee is proving our pointTo take this one step further on September 18 I published an article entitled Sentiment Speaks Will The Fed Cause A MiniCrash wherein I noted the followingIn fact on September 11 a week and a half before the Fed meeting I noted the followingNow for those of you who have been following my public articles you would likely know that I set a target for this decline in the 42304274SPX region before it even began And this past week we hit a low of 4217SPXMoreover we even were able to identify the specific twists and turns during the recent market action as outlined in a blog post this past weekAnd as one of our members notedSo lets turn our focus to the action seen on Friday If you read the blog post above you would know that I was expecting one more decline as of Thursday As I outlined to our members as long as the resistance box I outlined on my chart held as resistance I was expecting a decline into the end of the week to potentially complete the downside structureWhat was truly interesting about the action on Friday was that the market initially declined as expected supposedly due to the jobs report published that morning However once it struck a double bottom it then turned strongly in the opposite direction and rallied over 100 points off that low As one of the commenters to my article last week notedAnd as one of our members joked in our trading roomI even saw a number of people comparing the action seen on Friday to the action seen on October 13 2022 which was a day when hotterthanexpected inflation numbers came out yet it marked the bottom of the market since that time as it rallied 6 off the low struck that day And if you had been following our analysis during that time too you would know we were expecting a major market low around 3500SPX with a further expectation of a rally to take us to 4300 from there no matter what the newsIf you have not realized it yet I will again repeat that while the news can act as a catalyst to a market move the substance of that news will often not be determinative of the direction of that market move And if you are being honest then you have to realize the truth of this proposition What ultimately directs the market move is the nature of the market sentiment at the time of the announcement Allow me to give you an example of how we were looking at the market sentiment structure at the end of the weekWe were on high alert that the market was prepared for a reversal as I outlined to our members on Thursday morning as we were preparing for the decline we expected into FridayThe ellipse referred to in the quote above was pointing to a strong rally back to the 43164,106,2023-10-09,8

5,Sentiment Update: So You Think The Bear Market Is Over,In an article last February  we forecast a second wave of the bear market We suggested the decline of 2022 was the first part of a two waveWe suggested this second wave would last about the same time as the first  nine months If July 31st is the start that would mean the low of the second wave would occur around mid MayWe also suggested the second wave would decline about theWe discussed the economic foundation behind such a decline a month ago in this article The Now our two Master Sentiment Indicators show that if were right about this second down wave there is no sign from market sentiment that its overThis chart is a graphic representation of what we expect from this second wave of the bear market As we said this wave down isnt really a bear market in itself but the second wave down of a much longer bear marketThis longer bear market is in the form of two large declining waves of 25 each separated by a major rally back to the previous high Theyre highlighted in the pink boxes below A description of this is found in the text under the graphThe two charts below are our Master Sentiment Indicators  one measures sentiment over the long term the other over the short to intermediate term Theyre composites made by putting other sentiment indicators together into one in a mathematically consistent way The first one called the Master Sentiment Indicator or MSI is calculated weekly The other STMSI is calculated on a daily basisBear markets have never ended without investor sentiment becoming extremely bearish at the bottom At bear market lows people become so negative they cant see anything but further price declines We call these Green Zone readings Weve indicated past green zone readings on the charts with arrowsYou can clearly see the extreme readings that accompanied last years bear market low We heralded the bullish meaning of these green zone readings all last year yet only a few readers paid attentionWhen applying sentiment to help find market highs and lows you follow the price trend either up or down until sentiment has gone to an extreme Since we dont have that yet we assume that the downtrend in prices will continue until these indicators reach green zone readingsYou can see that the current rating on both these indicators is not yet in the Green Zone We will hold with the bearish forecast until we get green zone readings   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,41,2023-10-29,8

7,Sentiment Update: A Bear Market Inflection Point,An inflection point is a moment in time when small but critical events determine long term trends We think today is such a moment red circle and is defined by this questionIs the recent two month 8 decline just a normal correction in a bull market  which is now ending and the market about to move higher  or is it the first selling wave of a much larger decline or bear market as diagrammed belowWeve watched the evolution of a possible ABC price pattern since we forecasted it  Market Sentiment And A Bear Market Elliot Wave Flat We had hoped to reach last years high of 4800 on the SP 500 before the start of the second bear market but it seems new highs in longterm interestMetrics of investor sentiment usually help guide us through times like this so lets first update market sentiment before we address this questionWe have two master sentiment indicators One measures investor expectations for the long term the other expectations for the short to intermediate term Theyre made by combining other sentiment indicators into one indicator in a mathematically consistent wayThe latest reading of the STMSI is 51 which puts it halfway between a green zone reading and neutral sentiment This is the most extreme bearish reading since the near red zone reading of 67 on July 19th That nearred zone reading which occurred at the peak price of the SP 500 was thought to signal a shortterm correction and not a major market topWe figured the rapid reversal in bullish sentiment that followed confirmed this short term view In fact we gave a short term buy signal on the market at the low a month ago Up to last week we continued to hold the view that this correction was short term and the market would soon recover and eventually move back to the highs made last yearWere not so sure of this now The new high in long term interest rates is unsettling the long term picture and we think there is a high probability that the SP 500 highs made in July were the peak of the rally and weve started into the long expected second bear market We wrote about this a week ago in The MSI chart shows the latest reading at 37 which also puts it on the bearish side of neutral It confirms what the STMSI indicator is signaling Since the MSI changes more slowly than the MSI if the current market decline that started in July is the expect second bear market there is room for a four or fiveweek decline in stocks before this indicator moves into the extreme bearish Green Zone signaling the bottom of the marketWe will now look at what the individual indicators that make up these master indicators are saying We put them in two categories  those based on surveys and those based on investor buying activityThis table shows the five investment surveys that go into our master indicators As you can see four of the surveys are well onto the bearish side of neutral while the Investors Intelligence survey still indicates mostly long term bullish sentiment The average which is marked by the yellow highlighted X is just on the bearish side of neutral at 3 The latest survey of the American Association of Active Investment Managers NAAIM shows an average investment position of 36 That puts our moving average of the weekly results at 6 on the scale This cautious ranking continues to make the NAAIM survey the most bearish of all the investment surveys Remember extreme bearishness is positive for the stock market but it must be at an extreme reading to have meaning The two Hulbert surveys of newsletter writers  one for the general market and the other the Nasdaq  are at 5 and 4 respectively which is midway on the bearish side of neutral But again it must be at an extreme reading to be actionable Last week 30 of AAII members were bullish while 42 percent were bearish Our ranking of the moving average of their weekly numbers is at 5 which puts it halfway between neutral and extremely beari,69,2023-10-17,8
8,Sentiment Speaks: It Makes No Sense That The Market Will Continue To Rally,I love reading what the media tries to explain a market move as it just makes me chuckle On Friday morning when the market rallied into the open this was the headline on CNBCStock futures rise on hope increasingAnd only an hour later the market went red I guess that hope was dashed quite quicklyMoreover I am seeing more and more perspectives that the market should not have risen this high and why it cant go any higher Specifically many claim that a rising dollar and rising interest rates are now going to kill the stock market And they believe that there are no fundamental reasons for the rally to go onBefore we look at this perspective a bit more closely allow me to remind you of my perspectiveTo be honest such perspectives make me scratch my head It makes me question whether these market participants have even looked at market history or are they just regurgitating the common fallacies about the market because it makes sense within their world view as to how things should happen Personally I believe it is best to analyze markets based upon what is rather than what we want it to be You will be much more successful in the long runBut as far as market history we do not have to go back too far to recognize that the market was around the 3500SPX region when rates were in the same general range where we find ourselves today Yet the market is 30 higher When you come to terms with that then you have to reasonably conclude that rates have not been a factor Therefore if rates do rise and the market does drop from hereon which is not what I am expecting the logical conclusion is that this is simply a coincidental factor at least based upon the proof of the market action seen over the last year So we can logically throw this fundamental perspective out the doorYet I am simply amazed when I see people take the position that the market is simply wrong And so many are extremely confident that the market is about to drop when reality hits the market And this is exactly why they have missed the 30 rallyFolks if the market diverges from your premise then it should lead you to only one conclusion you and not the market are wrong Again may I remind you of the famous words of Jesse LivermoreSo please spare me the double talk as to why the market has rallied 30 against these common fundamental perspectives The most productive action in which you can now engage is to accept you are wrong and try to understand why you are wrong And I would strongly suggest you read my article linked above to guide you to that understandingAnd if you would like to read a bit more about my perspective on why it is foolish to rely upon these seeming correlations feel free to read the following article as wellAs far as the premise that a rising dollar is negative for the stock market well I guess anyone holding this perspective has not even bothered to look at what the DXY has done over the last decade And if you are amongst those that do not know the DXY has rallied with the stock market over the last 15 years After you pick your jaw up off the floor feel free to check the charts to see for yourselfNow even though we have herein obliterated a number of common fallacies and seeming correlations I am quite certain it will not stop analysts and investors from clinging to these outdated and erroneous views And the certainty with which they will continue to post these views will likely only increase They simply know that they are rightI guess one could apply the old phrase often wrong but rarely in doubt to these people If you ask them they will proudly tell you that is only a matter of time before the market proves them right Yet they fail to realize that they missed a 30 rally by being rightMy goal in highlighting these facts week after week is not really to change these people of which I speak as that is likely an exercise in futility Rather my goal is to force many of you to reco,8,2023-10-10,8
9,Sentiment Speaks: Are We Ready To Rally To 4800?,Inflation the Fed interest rates RussiaUkraine war IsraeliHamasHezbollah war Iran China North Korea housing earnings oil politics bank instability unemployment US Dollar etc Did I forget anything Well I am quite sure there are other issues that many are focused upon which I did not enumerate But the point is that almost every single article written about the stockNow take a step back and ask yourself how many of these authors focusing upon all these factors have been able to accurately and consistently outline to you where the market is headed Have you ever considered why they cantWell the simple answer is that none of these factors drive the market so they are looking in the wrongIn a 1988 study conducted by Cutler Poterba and Summers entitled What Moves Stock Prices they reviewed stock market price action after major economic or other type of news including major political events in order to develop a model through which one would be able to predict market moves RETROSPECTIVELY Yes you heard me right They were not even at the stage yet of developing a prospective prediction modelHowever the study concluded that macroeconomic news    explains only about one fifth of the movements in stock market prices In fact they even noted that many of the largest market movements in recent years have occurred on days when there were no major news events They also concluded that there is surprisingly small effect from big news of political developments    and international events They also suggest thatSo rather than focusing on economics and geopolitics there must be a better way to forecast the stock market There is and it is based upon a view of market sentimentWhen I have made this claim in the past many question me as to how sentiment drives the market and simply turns on its own without any exogenous drivers My answer is simply biologyIntuitive and knowledgeable investors and analysts recognize that market participants move in herds in the same way as many animals You see humans are hard wired for herding within their basal ganglia and limbic system within their brain which is a biological response they share with all animals And this is driven by emotion and not by reasonThere have been many recent studies that support this perspective For example in a study performed by Dr Joseph Ledoux a psychologist at the Center for Neural Science at NYU he noted that emotion and the reaction caused by such emotion occurs independent and prior to the ability of the brain to reasonIn a paper entitled Large Financial Crashes published in 1997 in Physics A a publication of the European Physical Society the authors within their conclusions present a nice summation for the overall herding phenomena within financial marketsSo while almost all authors attempt to reason with the market based upon all the factors outlined above we have to finally come to the realization that it really is useless if our goal is to determine which way the market is going to move based upon societal sentiment As I have said before attempting to reason with the stock market an emotional environment is akin to attempting to use logic to reason with your spouse when they are emotional How well does that work for youThe definition of insanity as attributed to Albert Einstein is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result Based upon this definition it would suggest that most of those who base their analysis on the factors noted above are insane And while what I am saying here is clearly not going to stop the insanity I am hoping to at least open the minds of some of you to the truth of what I have been presenting for many yearsThe fact that I engage in an esoteric form of analysis and still have 75000 followers on a fundamental analysis website have the 3rd largest paid service on a fundamental analysis website and have 8000 subscriber,84,2023-09-05,8
10,Sentiment Speaks: Do We Rally Or Crash Into 2024?,Over the Sukkot religious holiday this past weekend my wife and I were hosting several families for lunch when the conversation turned to the stock market The topic was about how much truth there is in the market todayThe discussion began with my friend who is a therapist telling me about a client with whom he is working clearly without telling me anything specific that is an employee at a major bank who sells investment products for the bank This client is struggling with guilt feelings about selling the products of the bank to individual investors knowing that he is selling what is best for the banks profitability rather than what is best for the investorTo this end I explained to him that overall advisors interests are not aligned with those of their clients I explained to him why thisWe then moved on to a discussion of the intellectual dishonesty that is presented by the general financial news media and analysts alike I explained that rather than actually understanding why the market moves they simply look at the most recent news feed and attempt to draw a causative conclusion as to why the market moves based upon the most recent news events And many times these conclusions are absolutely nonsensical often even contradictory to something they may have claimed just the day before Yet many investors are too easily willing to accept these perspectives as truth no different than sheep willing to be sent to the slaughterThese are the same issues upon which we focus week after week in the pages of the Sentiment Speaks series of articles I publish on Seeking Alpha And as I continually harp upon one must take the wise words of Robert Prechter to heart in order for you to see the truth of our financial marketsAnd amazingly most of the 20 people sitting around our table were quite surprised by some of these points I was presenting Sadly those sitting around my table were a representative example of the investing public who are too easily swayed by these ridiculous causative narratives that are presented daily in the media and by financial advisorsAnd again the goal of our Sentiment Speaks series is to open your eyes to these false narratives constantly on display throughout the financial media and strongly urging you to focus upon what is truly important in the financial markets  and that is priceSo without further ado lets move on to our price perspectiveIn the bigger picture of our market if you have been following my work you would know that I was expecting the market to bottom at the 3500SPX region and then begin a rally that would ultimately take us over the 4300 region despite all the bearishness abound at the timeAs the market moved into the 43754425SPX region I became very cautious and suggested to our members that they begin raising cash again While the market did travel a bit higher than I had expected at the October lows my maximum expectation at the time was the 4505SPX region I was outlining my primary expectation throughout the summer that we would likely return to the 42304275SPX region I also outlined a lower support that I will be watching very carefully and that is the 416585SPX regionIf you have read my articles over the last few weeks you would also know that I again outlined in a September 11 article my expectations for the market to set up a drop to the 42304275SPX region And then a week later I even outlined my view that the expected drop will likely be blamed on the Fed even if the Fed does nothing different Well thus far this is exactly what has been occurring In fact the low struck thus far was 4238SPXYet I am not quite certain we are done with the downside as the downside pattern does not look truly complete From an Elliott Wave perspective if the market is unable to climb back through the 437075SPX resistance then I am seeing strong potential for another drop to take shape And where that drop finds support is going to be,58,2023-10-16,8
11,The Long Bull Market To Come,All but the most psychologically robust investors are destined to suffer from recency bias particularly where actual or potential market crashes are concerned Twentythree years on from the dotcom crisis fears of a repeat of that specific crash continue to haunt investors minds Fifteen years on from the mortgage crisis investors fear a 2008style collapse may be just around the cornerInvestor psychology is mostly defective because even when a significant correction does take place most cannot recognize when a bottom is in place and a recovery begins When corrections hit and risk asset prices drop the majority of investors simply expect further drops This is true whether the correction is sharp and deep as per the drop in equities from the 2019 highs to the March 2020 Covid lows or whether its slow but relentless as was the case in equities during the 2022 ratehike cycle Many investors lost money in 2020 and 2021 despite the relentless upmove in risk assets And many have repeated this mistake in 2023 because they disbelieved that stocks had bottomed as early as May 2022 and were simply waiting for another leg down When spike lows came along in October 2022 and again in January 2023 fearful investors saw this as confirmation of their expectations and failed to switch out of shorts or cash into long positions Today many remain disbelieving of the very significant rally in equities this year despite missing out on real gains that could have been bankedThe weakest of the four US major equity indices  the Russell 2000  is up slightly on the year and the strongest  the Nasdaq  is up 40 in each case on a total return basisToday there is a strong opinion amongst many investors that the Nasdaq and indeed SP 500 boom this year has been purely due to an AI bubble andor that its only a handful of stocks that have propelled the indices upwards These investors believe that the true story is told by the Dow and the Russell weighed down by troubled oldline andor financial sector names and believe that the Nasdaq and the SP will soon correct back down to the October 2022 lows or lower They cite rising 10year US Treasury note yields as evidence of this and point to the inevitable damage to stocks that will be caused by a sustained inflationary environmentWe believe this take on risk assets is incorrect The time to be fearful of inflation was when the Fed had yet to raise rates in earnest The major top struck in equities at the end of 2021 was the moment to take profits andor open short equity positionsSource Cestrian Capital Research November 2021If you made that call correctly and acted upon it our congratulations to you If you then reversed course late in 2022 you are among a handful of truly skilled market operators If you still believe that risk assets are set to decline We acknowledge that you could be right  anything can happen in financial markets  but we ask that you consider the followingOne of the reasons that many investors and traders refuse to accept the reality of the market in front of them is that they do not fully understand the drivers of risk asset prices In the very short term risk asset prices can be blown  and  by any number of eddies in the cosmos But the most liquid instruments  the SP 500 and the Nasdaq 100 in particular  do move in response to two factorsThe first is exogenous and has to do with the creation of money  still more specifically the creation of credit within monetary policy  and the deployment of that credit in government fiscal policyWe include below a chart authored by Robert P Balan and Timothy R Kiser who lead Predictive Analytic Models a highly respected research and trading service hosted on the Seeking Alpha platformTo understand the chart read the subheader and then follow its logic First credit creation then government expenditure then liquidity then risk asset prices In that order And you know this to be true,106,2023-10-02,1

13,Icahn Enterprises: Trading Above NAV With Poor Market Sentiment,Following the short  that was released for Icahn Enterprises LP  back in May earlier this year the share price has plunged by over 60 Given the poor sentiment surrounding the company I dont think its the timeIEP is a  conglomerate with operations spanning various sectors including investment energy automotive food packaging real estate home fashion and pharmaceuticals The company conducts its business activities both in the United States and internationally One of itsLooking at the  performance of the company in the last quarter it seems rather lackluster as IEP had a consolidated net loss of 269 million up from the negative 128 million it had 12 months earlier This seems to be a rather poor trajectory that the company is heading in right now The release of the short report from Hindenburg was a significant blow to the valuation of the company as more investors got their eyes on some of the alleged negative practices and performance related to the business Down over 60 since May this year the company appears to be in a falling knife scenario in my viewThe dividend for the company has been cut and even with a quarterly payment of 1 it seems somewhat unsustainable if IEP continues to post a negative bottom line and dilute shares to fuel the dividend for investorsThe last time the company had a positive bottom line was in 2018 and I dont think we are recovering from those levels very quickly The rise in interest rates has surely also hurt the investment returns from the company as its pushing earnings by companies down the drain so to speak For IEP though the interest expenses have continuously been quite high at 500  600 million each year Even if IEP didnt have any debt I dont believe it could rescue the bottom line to a positive level unfortunatelyThe liquid assets for the company remain quite solid at 65 billion with a large chunk of that coming from holding company investments in investment funds at 37 billion With these liquid assets the company is in a position where it could pay off a substantial amount of the longterm debts of 7 billion However I do still see some risk here given that the bottom line is negative and IEP will likely need to dilute shares to find the capital to pay down liabilitiesThe cash for the company has been declining steadily over the years It now sits at 74 billion and can cover a large portion of the liabilities for the business The cash position should be enough to enable IEP to continue to distribute a dividend to investors but eventually the company may be forced to cut it again if the net income cant reach a profitable levelThe dividend yield for the business has risen quickly as a result of the significant decline in the share price The FWD yield is somewhere around 20 following the 50 cut in the dividend received With shares outstanding continuing to rise it seems that if 1 per share is staying 2024 will see dividends paid out totaling nearly 400 million for one quarter alone This is a substantial amount and is weighing the company down as they need to find capital for the dividend and doing this often causes share dilution I think its a company we need to watch closely and getting in now seems to have a relatively limited downside given the high yield But the slightest decline in the cash position or significant margin declines would make IEP a very unappealing stock to own and making it a sell is very possible I thinkThe significant increase in the total outstanding IEP units during the second quarter surpassing 10 has notably impacted IEPs NAV per unit resulting in a decline If this pattern of continuous growth in outstanding units persists for IEP its likely to maintain a negative sentiment in the market potentially causing further declines in the companys share price This trend has already been observed earlier in the year raising concerns among investorsIEP currently maintains a trading mult,8,2023-10-25,8

15,Sentiment Speaks: Gold Going To $5000? Ain't Happening Anytime Soon,I am not sure if much of what is written regarding markets  especially the gold market  is based upon ignorance or just intellectual dishonesty In either case I am absolutely sick of itI saw an articleBut before I explain the historical perspective which eviscerates this view I want to address a few comments that I saw in the same articleAre there cases where some big banks were caught manipulating prices Of course there are But one must actually read those cases carefully to understandSpoofing is when traders place market orders  either buying or selling securities  and then cancel them before the order is ever fulfilled In a sense its the practice of initiating fake orders with no intention of ever seeing them executed And traders that engage in spoofing are usually attempting to make money on a penny or two move in a price When you deal with highfrequency trading this can add up to a lot of money over timeYet no one seems to understand that spoofing is not what causes large downside movements in the metals markets And this is when it is most often used to claim that a downside move in the metals market was due to manipulation In fact if you review the cases closely you will note that the spoofing occurred in BOTH directions in the marketI go into this discussion in much more depth in this article if you are interestedWe see this all too often everywhere articles are writtenAs Francis Bacon noted hundreds of years agoMoreover as Daniel Crosby author of The Behavioral Investor wroteAnd as Nobel Award winner Daniel Kahneman notedSo every time we see a bullish article on gold all the goldbugs come out of the woodwork to note their agreement with the excellent article Unfortunately the comments section should not be a point at which you determine whether an article is excellent or not Rather it is only when you view that article through a prism of truth can you determine whether that article is excellent or notThen I saw the following commentAnd it almost made me cheer out loud as this is someone who is seeking the truth to the market And as he correctly pointed out gold did not move up with inflation so there was another fallacy that was obliterated which I really do not need to address any furtherClearly gold does not move as most people expect And that is because they are looking in the wrong placeAs the article pointed out that it will be the Feds expected easing cycle to cause gold to rally clearly the author did not bother to review historically what occurred during easing cyclesFor those of you that have invested in the metals markets over the last several decades you may remember that Fed was full into an easing cycle as we moved into the 2010s And it made everyone including their mother grandmother and grandmothers dog believe that gold was about to skyrocket on that actionWell back in 2011 I penned my first public article on gold wherein I summarized my expectation at the end of the articleIn fact even before topped I responded to a question regarding how far I expect gold to correct and my answer was the 7501000 regionAs we now know gold topped within 6 of my target I set the month before and then bottomed within 50 of the target I set years before And my friends gold dropped almost 900 during a Fed easing cycle Not only was it an interest rate easing cycle but the Fed was even actively engaged in something called Quantitative Easing Yes you can read that again as it is the truth Gold dropped significantly during a major Fed easing cycleSo based upon history will it be an easing cycle upon which you can rely to view that gold is going to rally to 5000 soon I think notNow do I believe that gold will be going to 5000 10000 or even 25000 Yes But folks that is based upon a 50 year cycle Not soonSo I will reiterate my nearterm expectations I am looking for gold to rally to the 2428 region as my,23,2023-10-28,8

17,REITs Vs. 5%+ Yielding Money Markets,We hear that question all the time over and over againWe dont blameBut we think that many investors are thinking about the REITs vs money markets debate all wrong right now There is far more to consider besides just the annualized yieldWe think that simply understanding this differenceLets say you have just received your first paycheck ever and are thinking about what to do with it The standard suggested order of destinations for that cash goes something like thisOf course there is a lot of nuance that we are skipping over here but this is the generally accepted order of what to do with your money according to personal finance expertsLets assume your income is more than enough to cover your living expenses and all debt you may have once had is now paid off except perhaps your home mortgage Many personal finance experts would now recommend building up a shortterm savings buffer outside a nonretirement account to cover any emergency expenses or normal living expenses in the case of a job lossMoney markets are ideally suited to act as this nonretirement emergency savings account Money markets are insured by the SIPC Securities Investor Protection Corporation for up to 500000 and they generally offer higher yields than FDICinsured bank savings accountsYounger people with stable employment can perhaps get away with only a few months worth of living expenses stashed away in a savings account or money market On the other end of that spectrum retirees may want to have a year or more of cash in money markets because of their lack of employment incomeThis is the value of a money market It provides stability as shares of money market funds are set at 1 And when the Fed raises its key policy rate the interest generated from money markets rises with itWhen the Fed Funds Rate is over 5 as it is now money markets will likewise yield over 5 During those times it can be tempting to view money markets as a better place to store ones incremental dollar than a REIT yielding say 45For virtually all of 2023 money markets have offered a higher yield than REITs represented below by the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF Shares But here it is vital to differentiate between  and If your shortterm savings are adequate for your goalsneeds then the better use of your incremental dollar is to apply it toward some sort of longterm investmentIn other words if the choices are money markets or REITs you would probably be best suited to put your incremental money toward REITs once your shortterm savings are adequateThe reason for this is simple a money markets yield is temporary while a REITs yield is ideally permanent and comes with growthWe can demonstrate this by comparing the dividends of a standard money market  the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund Investor Class   to a standard REIT  Realty Income If you came across a stock paying a dividend this erratic and prone to huge swings most investors wouldnt touch it with a 10foot pole And yet when its a money market income investors seem not to think or care about the distribution variabilityWhen the Fed raises its policy rate the dividends from money market funds immediately go up starting the very next month But when the Fed lowers the interest rate money market dividends immediately go down with itOn the other hand Os dividend kept steadily rising over time even through the Great Recession of 20082009 and the COVID19 pandemic of 20202021Now you might accuse us of cherrypicking here After all many REITs had to cut their dividends during the Great Recession as well as during the COVID19 pandemicBut that is why we dont invest in REIT ETFs like the VNQ We literally  cherrypick what we view as the best REITs with the most total return potential andor dividend safety depending on ones goalsThe point here is that if you have done your due diligence and invested wisely the income investor ,3,2023-10-11,8

20,Perception Is Not The Reality: 2 REITs I'm Buying All The Way Down,Im sure many investors probably have felt like the guy in the picture above the last couple of months I consider myself a pretty experienced investor now and one thing the market has taught me is patience But Ill admitServing over 21 years in the Navy has prepared me to deal with almost anything Ive been on quite a few ships destroyers mostly You get used to operating in chaos and Ive really gotten used to doing just that I honestly think thats what prepared my psyche to deal with the current turmoil in the sector  In the Navy upper leadership would always say Perception is reality I absolutely hated this saying and never used it during my time as a leader To me this was an excuse for them to convince themselves they were right in their thoughts So no matter how dumb it sounded or if they didnt have evidence to back up their claim whenever you justified or debunked this they would say Perception is Reality In my eyes a good leader would never say that but do their due diligence to actually find the truthI look at the selloff in the REIT sector the same Investors should do their due diligence to actually see have the fundamentals changed or has the stock sold off because many are now panicking Lets get into two REITs Im actually buying hand over fistIn my opinion if you invest in the stock market you should have a longterm outlook But everyone doesnt share that same sentiment some investors prefer to trade in and out of the market I used to do that and its all fun and games and ultimately youre most likely going to lose money gambling that way Now I buy and my plan is to hold my investments forever unless the fundamentals of the company change And its hard to keep that mindset and stick with the plan when you constantly see the price dropping on your favorite stocksBut you have to reassure yourself that that is not the case Whether thats looking into the financials of your stocks every day or every week Although that can be very overwhelming Like I previously mentioned I used to day trade and its emotionally draining Thats why I adopted dividend investing for the longterm It may not be as fun to some but I really enjoy watching dividends hit my brokerage account on schedule So my advice to readers is buy stable quality companies with strong fundamentals and stay invested Weve all heard the saying from Warren Buffett  And now investors have been running into Tbills while they wait out the stormInvestors have been rotating out of the market from loweryielding investments and into higheryielding ones like money markets Tbills and certificates of deposits Right now those are currently paying more than a lot of REITs But those arent the only stocks that have seen their prices drop Consumer staple stocks like CocaCola  and PepsiCo  who both have 5year average dividend yields of roughly 3 have also sold off in the last month And this could continue well into 2024 I dont know when the market will bottom but I know Ill be running to the Black Friday Sale and taking advantage of this opportunityMany stocks are now reaching GFC price levels which has also caused investors to get spooked Weve all heard the saying Scared money dont make money and I agree Ive always been a risk taker and this time Im staying put As you can see BDCs prices have held steady during the same time I hold both Ares Capital  and Capital Southwest  in my taxable account and their prices havent moved much Its because of their yields Their fundamentals have nothing to do with it same as REITsCohen  Steers Head of Real Estate  Research Rich Hill recently said As you can see below REITs have an average historical FFO growth of 53 but this is expected to come in at 35 next year Not the same as prior years but growth is still growth Like I previously mentioned my goal is to hold my investments forever and collect enough income to live off of ,237,2023-10-13,1

22,"AT&T Not For The Meek, But Buy And DRIP Indefinitely",We previously covered   in August 2023 discussing the massive pessimism embedded in its prospects attributed to the sluggish stock movement despite the bottom line and Free Cash Flow FCF beats in FQ223WhileIn this article we will be discussing Ts mixed prospects after its recent FQ323 earnings call with the raised FCF guidance and subsequent pop in stock prices unlikely to make up for the capital losses observed in its stock decline since March 2020We will also be focusing on the market sentiments surrounding this fallen angel with us preferring toFor now the T stock has popped by over 5 after the recent FQ323 earnings call thanks to its robust YTD FCF generation of 104B 30 YoY and raised  by 05B to 165B 19 YoYBased on the detailed charts provided by a SA News Editor  it is apparent that the management continues to execute well as net adds grow across different segments consequently contributing to the expansion in its toplineTs income investment thesis has played out well indeed with the raised FCF guidance suggesting its safer forward dividend payouts no matter the state of the telecoms balance sheet and stock performanceWith many pensioners including those whom previously worked at the telecom relying on its dividends as part of their retirement portfolios we are not surprised that the stock remains a popular choice for many income investorsPerhaps this is why the T stocks FWD EV Sales valuation of 224x and FWD EV EBITDA of 632x have normalized nearer to its 3Y prepandemic means of 225x 686x though still impacted compared to the sector medians of 170x 803x respectivelyThen again investors must also note that market sentiments surrounding its cash flow remains pessimistic despite the moderately raised FCF guidance based on its FWD Price Cash Flow valuation of 282x compared to its 5Y averages of 436x and sector median of 834xLongterm T shareholders may very well understand Mr Markets pessimism due to the telecoms immense longterm debts of 1267B 07 QoQ 22 YoY and consequently higher annualized interest expenses of 664B 37 QoQ 169 YoY in the latest quarterIt is unsurprising that the combination of the elevated interest rate headwind and intensified FY2023 5G 232 YoY has resulted in its impacted FCF profitabilityFor example based on the T managements guidance we are only looking at an underwhelming FCF margins of approximately 136 02 points YoY compared to its FY2019 levels of 16 29 points YoYThis is assuming that its FQ423 revenue is inline to its FQ323 levels of 3035B resulting in an estimated FY2023 overall revenues of 12074B inline YoYNonetheless it appears that the T stock is trading near its fair value of 1587 based on its FWD Price Cash Flow valuation of 282xThis is based on the managements FY2023 cash from operation guidance of 405B 264 YoY and its 718B of share count at the latest quarter resulting at an estimated cash from operation per share of 563 321 YoYOn the one hand we maintain our conviction that T is likely to remain a battleground stock since its dividends have been insufficient to cover the capital losses observed in its stock decline thus far especially given the previous cut in Q122On the other hand we can also understand why some analysts and readers continue to champion the T stock since they may have chosen to perceive it as a stock to buy and DRIP indefinitely thanks to the relatively attractive dividend yieldsWith losses only realized if the stock is traded or sold longterm investors would have simply enjoyed a consistent dividend payout every quarterly no matter the noise in the stock marketWe suppose that there is no harm in viewing the T stock in this manner since no one can deny the fact that connectivity is an essential commodity no matter the uncertain macroeconomic outlookThis is especially due to the proliferation of socia,26,2023-10-29,8

25,Sentiment Speaks: The Market Is Simply Getting It Wrong,I really dont know how all of you do itMost of you pour over all types of data on a daily basis in order to attempt to gain some advantage in the market And when I read other articles andAmong those factors that you are all considering include the Fed interest rates the US dollar yield inversion China the labor market Japan consumer spending inflation the impending government shutdown and a softhard landing I didnt know we were on an airplane And these were just those cited in two articles and comments I read the other dayAnd each person that posts is quite confident that their factor is the major consideration one has to take intoI dont know about you but this makes my head spin How can one possibly weigh all of these considerations in a repeatable process to accurately determine the next move in the stock marketI believe if we are really honest with ourselves we would come to the conclusion that one simply cannot do so Rather I think it leads to significant confusion many times And this week was no exceptionFor example here is a headline that we saw on FridayAre you scratching your head I know I am What the heck does that headline even mean I think it displays the utter confusion of the writer in trying to present a reason as to why the market rallied on Friday despite the Fed reiterating it will continue to raise ratesIn fact I saw the following comment on one of the articles I just readClearly many were thinking that the market simply got it wrong Well may I again remind you of the famous words of Jesse LivermoreWhile you may be sick of my quoting Robert Prechters The Socionomic Theory of Finance I think it is one of the most brilliant books ever written on how the stock market really works And this quote is worth repeating until you are all able to internalize its lessonAnd if you continue to follow all the factors noted above you will likely continue to flounder especially on days like FridayFor those that do not know the story of how I began providing my analysis publicly well I can tell you that I was basically pushed into it by a popular market analyst who has been around for many decades The reason he kept pushing me as he explained to me was due to the accuracy of my analysis especially in the face of contrary expectations among the massesThe reason I had been able to do so was simply because I kept my analysis as simple as possible followed principles of Occams Razor and Fibonacci Pinball our own creation and tuned out all the extraneous noise I simply focused upon my process And having grown to 8000 subscribers and almost 1000 money manager clients since that time I think it has served us all quite wellIn fact this is what our subscribers have recently notedI will now tell you that even though we have caught most of the twists and turns in the last year and half it has still presented me with the most difficult market I have faced during the 12 years since we opened ElliottWaveTraderIf you have read my analysis during the last year and a half you would know how torn I am on the bigger picture in the market From an absolute purist standpoint I still have a huge issue with calling 2021 the top to the market since we do not have a clear 5wave completed rally into that high from the March 2020 lowYet the structure of the rally which began in October 2022 had not been providing me a clear indication that we were going to rally back up to the 5000 region that I was seeking for a longterm top to be struck And due to this uncertainty I have been unable to be as strongly bullish in my expectations as you have seen prior to this period of time So risk management has been a strong focus for me as I have been taking this one step at a timeEven so I remained quite steadfast in my expectations for the market to rally to 4300 which was my primary expectation off the 3500SPX low despite all the voices to the contrary And I noted tha,55,2023-08-28,8

27,The Saudis Are Dead Serious On Pushing Oil Prices Higher,In the years Ive followed the oil market I have never seen the Saudis this determined to push oil prices up This includes the whatever it takes moment we saw in 2017 when the previous Saudi energy minister Khalid AlFalih started targetingSaudi crude exports for the first 24 days of August are averaging at the lowest level since June 2020 At 53 million bd Saudis will have reduced crude exports by 1 million bd since July Now we dont expect this figure to be final Crude exports for the upcoming week are showing a rebound so final figures could be closer to 56 to 58 million bdBut that doesntThose of you who follow us closely will know that our base case view is for the Saudis to extend the voluntary cut into yearend We explained that its because of the logistical timing issue of when exports hit physical inventories and the impact on market sentiment But with the latest Saudi crude export figure I cant help but wonder if the cut will likely be extended into Q1 of 2024Let me explainHere is IEAs assumption for global oil supply  demand balance into the end of 2024 Out of all of the IEA reports weve read to date the August OMR was the most balanced surprisingNow you will notice that both Q1 and Q2 of 2024 show stockbuilds Keep in mind that the IEA is not assuming the voluntary cut of 1 million bd into its balance in 2024 Instead it is assuming that the Saudis will continue its original 500k bd voluntary cutIn my view the Saudis played this one beautifully By keeping it on a monthtomonth basis it deters speculators from bidding up the long end of the curve and keeps the market at bay The monthtomonth action also prevents speculators from frontrunning prices which prevents any potential risk of demand destruction amidst a weakening global economy Instead the voluntary cut does the sole purpose it was meant to do reduce global inventoriesSo now imagine this scenario as we approach the end of October oil continues to trade in the range of 80 to 90 While global oil inventories have drained materially sentiment remains weak and speculators believe the impending recession will hurt oil demand Saudis are now deciding whether to extend to the end of December but as they look at global oil supply  demand balances Q1 shows a build All of the efforts of the voluntary cut up to that point would be pointless if storage gets to build back up againWith the voluntary cut already in place whats to stop the Saudis from slowly unwinding the cut Perhaps its best to after Q1 to slowly unwind the 1 million bd cut as to avoid any inventory buildup In addition with Russia cooperating finally and if the Russians extend their voluntary cut into yearend then its physically very difficult for Russia to increase production during the heart of winter All of these things suggest to me that it is better than 50 chance that the Saudis extend this voluntary cut in some form or shape into the end of Q1 and possibly Q2 of 2024Now this is not the consensus view and many of the oil analysts expect the Saudis to unwind the voluntary cut once the storage draw has materialized but we digress We think the ultimate goal for the Saudis is price stability so if that implicitly implies a lower overall storage level to achieve this then the Saudis will keep the voluntary cut until they see fitThis means that Brent would have to easily average over 90 for many months before the Saudis contemplate a reduction We just dont see that when the consensus expects a build in Q1In the years Ive followed the Saudis this is the most determined Ive ever seen them If we are right and the Saudis continue to extend then the market will get a rude awakening Global onshore crude inventories are already starting to accelerate to the downside and theres more to come Perhaps like the article we published on Monday it is really just that straightforward Perhaps it is not We will know wit,12,2023-10-09,5
28,Asset Allocation And Strategy For The Current Bear Market,On October 2nd we wrote an article titled  explaining why we thought stocks are headed back down to last years lows In the article we said thisTo implement this new view we made asset allocation changes last week The allocation is based on a sequence of events weve noticed numerous times concerning interest rates and declining stock prices but never had the opportunity to act onThe sequence is this A bull market continues to advance while long term interest rates rise bond prices fall Near the peak in rates stock prices reverse and a bear market begins As stock prices fall interest rates begin to decline bond prices rise reaching their lows as stock prices reach their lows The sequence is simple  first bonds then stocksBased on this sequence the following is our current investment allocationWe made the change not only because we believe stocks have already started the movement back to last years lows but also because an important indicator to us points to an imminent decline in long term rates and a rally in treasury bonds In other words the investment sequence described above is already in playThis is an active and not a passive strategy If were right well hold the above allocation for six to nine months If all goes well well take profits in bonds and reallocate the proceeds back to stocks near their lows changing the allocation back to a more aggressive stance of 75 stocksThe position in GLD is there because its 1 a separate asset class and 2 because of the strong buy signal we continued to have for it We believe the Vanguard zero coupon treasury ETF EDV is the best fund to use to implement the bond side of this strategy since it will produce the greatest profit if long term rates fall even if just a littleWhen long term interest rates were over 10 in the 1980s we used zero coupon strips to create guaranteed retirement income and to hedge against the risk of falling rates They are a wonderful vehicle to achieve large price gains from bonds when purchased at the right moment Of course this price risk goes both ways when used for that purposeThis is the indicator weve found best to forecast interest rates Its based on the Hulbert survey of newsletter writers who forecast the bond market You would think it should be based on something more fundamental or economic but over the years we have found otherwiseLike all investment surveys it acts as a contrary opinion indicator When too many newsletter writers are bullish on bonds bond prices usually decline The opposite is true if theyre bearishThe chart graphs our ranking of the survey over the last thirteen years against the price of EDV and highlighted key moments with green arrows including the current one Green zone readings are when writers are bearish on bonds which is bullish Red zone readings are when most are bullish on bonds which suggests cautionThis indicator plus the clear five wave structure of the three year price decline is strong evidence to us that the bear market in bonds is at least temporarily ending and a strong rally lies aheadWe are using EDV for our bond asset not because of its income which is zero but because of its price volatility and correlation with longterm rates This next chart highlights the almost perfect correlation between EDV and 30 year bond yields TYX They are mirror images of each other as theory says they should be since the effective maturity of the EDV portfolio is 25 yearsWe believe the indicator in the previous chart plus the five wave declining structure suggests that 30 year interest rates will decline to 4 Weve indicated this with a black arrow If it does EDV will increase from its current price of 63 to 80 which is a gain of 27 This is by far the largest potential price gain of any long term treasury bond ETF available which makes it perfect for our purposesWe expect this to happen over the next six to nine months which is why EDV i,296,2023-08-26,3

30,The Russell 2000 Is About To Confirm Another Bear Market (Technical Analysis),In our last two articles we explained why the two month price decline since July is probably the start of another bear market The key reason was the new highs in longterm interest rates the importance ofIn the second article we outlined why market sentiment was conflicting in its signals  some indicators where pointing to a bull market while others to a bear market So we wroteAfter writing this we noticed we failed to provide guidelines on what theyre waiting for What investment picture has to clarify This article addresses that Clarification in this situation is based on a fundamental technical concept called divergence So this third article is really an extension or continuation of the first twoBy the way dont let the simplicity of what follows dissuade you People often think they have to analyze twenty factors to determine what the markets going to do This is wrong its normally something simpleDivergence has been used as a major indicator of coming bear markets since 1900 In fact the original Dow Theory was based on it A divergence occurs when one major price index hits new highs or double tops while another doesnt The longer the divergence time wise the more reliable the signalUsing two large etfs as proxies  SPY and IWM  this chart compares the SP 500 against the Russell 2000 Both are broad based price indices that track completely different types of companies The SP 500 tracks the large capitalized stocks while the Russell 2000 tracks the much smaller companiesWe think these two indices show the important divergence going on in the market today and is similar to what happen in the bear market of 197274 Then the divergence was also between the small cap stock indexes and the SP 500 which reflected the nifty fifty stocks The nifty fifty then is similar to the investor focus today in the magnificent sevenThe price divergence in the chart is obvious While the SP 500 effectively double topped in July and is still relatively close to its alltime highs the Russell 2000 has been in a trading range and is close to last years bear market lows The red circle shows thisIts our opinion that if the Russell 2000 breaks below last years bear market lows and gets to 160 on IWM then the Russell 2000 will have confirmed the start of a new leg down of a larger bear marketAnd if the Russell 2000 breaks down the SP 500 should breakdown too and reach last years lows point C as diagrammed We forecast this ABC pattern and a second bear market nine months ago as the most probable scenario  We still think its the most probable outcomeWe also marked with numbers the three times the Russell 2000 tried to penetrate the upper band of its trading range and failed To us this failure provides added confidence that the Russell 2000 will break below the lower band and signal a bear market  and do it relatively soonThis chart is the daily price of IWM and clearly shows how close it is to the breakdown target of 160 It would only take a decline of 65 to confirm that the Russell 2000 was in another bear marketIf the breakdown occurs the price target for IWM is 140 That would be a decline of 30 from the July high of just under 200 This is based on our January forecast of two bear markets of about equal size A 30 decline from a high of 200 takes us to 140 This low should occur sometime next SpringIf the SP 500 returned to last years low that would be an overall decline of around 25 from its July highRemember were not telling investors to sell their positions We wrote that investors should hold current positions but not add any  and to wait Since the Russell 2000 is so close to the lower end of its one year trading range this thesis allows an investor to act on the expectation of a bear market before it actually declines 20 which is the normal definition of a bear market It assumes the breakdown below the trading range would be the start of a major t,23,2023-10-23,1
31,S&P 500: Risk Of Collapse - Week Starting 23rd October (Technical Analysis), was titled Make or Break and based on this weeks performance the SP 500  is taking the latter option An October reversal was developing but bulls failed to step in at higher lows andOne small positive is that the key inflection level of 4216 has held the low of the week was 4323 but this was more to do with the clock stopping on the decline rather than any signs of support Mondays restart will be crucial and there is a high risk of a collapseThis weeks article will focus on what could happen if 4216 breaks and if there is still any chance of a Q4 rally Various technical analysis techniques will be applied to multiple timeframes in a topdown process whichIdeally reversals form when the low of the bar is set in the first part of the time period and the rally continues into the end The October bar bottomed on the 3rd of the month and was looking promising but is now below the open and back near the lows With seven sessions left in October this is a red flagAt current prices below the September low of 4238 the monthly chart is hovering in no mans land 413040 is the first major area of supportMonthly resistance is now the October high of 4393 then 459346074195 is minor support with 413040 an important level at the 20month MA and the high volume node also the centre of the 34914818 rangeThe September bar completed a Demark upside exhaustion count This is having a clear effect and the weakness can persist over several bars months It will take at least 9 months for another count to completeThis weeks bar engulfed the range of the previous bar and closed at the lows Its about as bearish as it gets Furthermore the weekly channel has now been broken after a feeble two week bounce New lows look likelyWhile there are support areas below the price action does not suggest they are worth speculating on until a positive reaction ie a return back above 4216Initial resistance is at 432535 then 4393 The broken channel may also be a hinderance and will be around 4260 next weekThe first potential support is 4195 The 50week MA will rise to the around 4194 next week so there is decent confluence in the areaA downside Demark exhaustion count will be on bar 6 of a possible 9 next weekThe daily chart has some stiff resistance in the 4400 area While I expected a dip from this area the strength of the move down and the break of 4283 were a surprise The heavy volume on Thursday and Friday underlined the bearish shiftFridays 4224 close was below the 200dma and perilously close to the 4216 inflection point A further gap down on Monday below 4216 could trigger some real panic and the proximity to the anniversary of Black Monday 1987 Monday 19th October wont help sentiment Im not saying there will be a repeat of the 226 daily drop but a 35 drop is possibleIt is worth noting both the previous two weekends have been equally worrying for investors and yet both the following Mondays have been strong and closed higher However this time the situation is more dangerous  for one it is tempting fate to look for a third Monday recovery in a row Secondly previous weeks did not have such a bearish technical setupResistance is the same as last week starting at the 4393 high up to gap fill at 4400 The 50dma and red channel will decline into the same area and add to the resistance thereSupport is the obvious 4216 then 4195 and 4151A downside Demark exhaustion count is underway and will be on bar 7 of a possible 9 on Monday A reaction is expected on bars 8 or 9 so this could lead to a bounce on Tuesday or Wednesday although a solid bottom may need higher timeframe exhaustion and the weekly count is still several weeks away from completionWars between UkraineRussia and IsraelHamas are a constant source of worry and negative headlines Markets have a mixed performance with this backdrop so there is not necessarily a need to sell everything Even so its not a time to ,163,2023-09-20,2
32,Is The VIX Broken?,Low volatility in the equity market is causing some analysts on Wall Street to  if the  might be broken Despite heightened risks of a recession rising interest rates threatening toSome suspect that the VIX has lost its relevance due to the popularity of zerodaystoexpiration 0DTE options which allow traders to hedge intraday risks more effectively Others argue that a subdued VIX is simply reflecting the benign sentiment underlying equity marketsIn this article we shall explore the recent performance of the VIX to ascertain if its behavior has altered fundamentally and if the VIX is still a reliable proxy for implied volatilityLet us first address the question ofTechnically the VIX Index is a benchmark designed to provide an uptotheminute market estimate of the implied volatility of the SP 500 Index  The VIX is calculated by using the midpoint of realtime SPX option bidask quotes More specifically the VIX Index is intended to provide an instantaneous measure of how much the market thinks the SP 500 Index will fluctuate in the 30 days from the time of each tick of the VIX IndexObjectively speaking the VIX is an unbiased representation of implied volatility calculated based on the actual prices of options quoted on the SPX Thus we should expect the VIX to run like clockwork and free from manipulation given its straightforward calculation and how the index itself cannot be directly traded Saying that the VIX is broken would mean the same thing as saying that the options market for the SPX is broken tooRecall that we mentioned earlier that the VIX has very little to do with fear Indeed investors being fearful and willing to pay to hedge their positions is not the only factor moving the VIX Many other factors including market liquidity execution preference by institutional funds speculative trading and optionselling strategies to extract premiums could all affect option pricing to different extents These decisions are aggregated and captured as implied volatility through option prices and the VIXIt is also worthwhile to note that the phenomenon associated with a persistently subdued VIX is not as unusual as most people think A quick search on Google for Is The VIX Broken will yield old articles and commentary debating on the subject every few years And soon enough the VIX would spike in response to some major riskoff event Indeed Wall Street analysts have been repeating the same ritual of questioning if the VIX is broken whenever it fails to live up to fearful expectationsTo put it bluntly  Just like how most investors are still struggling to come to terms with how the SPX had gained 124 yeartodate in spite of economic headwinds they too are struggling to accept how the VIX could remain so low But then again given how well the SPX has held up and how resilient the economy has been is there a real reason for the options market to price for a surge in volatility Explanations for why the VIX has been persistently low vary across financial media but the most widely accepted argument puts the blame on the increasing popularity of 0DTE options0DTE options which are option contracts that will expire on the same day that they are traded were fully introduced for all five trading days of the week by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe in 2022 The product soon became a popular tool for day traders who prefer not to carry their exposure beyond a single trading session Many analysts claim that hedge funds and other shortterm traders have since switched to trading 0DTE options instead of options with longer expirations Therefore the VIX which is calculated based on prices of SPX options averaging 30 days to expiration may no longer reflect the markets willingness to pay to hedge against the SPXAlthough that argument may seem theoretically possible we think the effect of 0DTE trading on the VIX might have been grossly exaggerated To be clear trading of 0DTE option,32,2023-10-13,8
33,Market Sentiment Suggests Fed Funds Rate Has Peaked... Again,In January 2023 the clues  to be aligning in favor of an end to the Federal Reserves rate hikes It was a false dawn  the Fed lifted its target rate four times in subsequent months by a total of 100Fast forward to today and once again the numbers leave room for speculating that rate hikes have peaked Rate cuts are a separate issue and on that front the outlook looks much weaker for unwinding tight policy By contrast the case for thinking that the central bank may stay its monetary hand is relatively compellingExhibit A is the implied probabilities for policy changes via the  Sentiment is currently pricing in a virtual certainty of no change in the upcoming FOMC meeting on Nov 1 followed by moderately confident estimates of holdingMeanwhile the policysensitive 2year US Treasury yield has been trading in a range recently which suggests that bond market sentiment is cautiously pricing a peak rates scenarioIn addition the 2year yield 505 as of Oct 23 continues to trade modestly below the current 525550 Fed Funds target range Thats another hint that the crowd is still leaning toward expectations that the hikes are historyLooking at the 2year yieldFed funds spread highlights the relative stability in the relationship recently Although the Treasury market got ahead of itself in previous months in pricing in peak rates the crowd is coming back to the ideaIf the downside bias strengthens in the weeks ahead that will be a new sign that confidence is building that the rate hikes have peakedAnother reason for thinking the Fed may be more comfortable with the level of monetary tightness Fed funds relative to unemployment and inflation are more restrictive now vs the level in January 2023 when the inflation was higher and monetary conditions were looserThe combination of softer inflation and tighter policy by itself is no guarantee that the Feds hiking cycle has ended but its a factor that supports the forecastAnother is the fact that real inflationadjusted interest rates are higher today vs January 2023 based on inflationindexed TreasuriesThe Fed in other words can leave its policy rate unchanged and let the market do the tightening through higher real yields  a passive tightening policyDespite the analysis above no one can rule out additional rate hikes entirely The main threats to the peak rate forecast at this point US economic resilience particularly if it ramps up and sticky inflationFor the moment though both of those risks appear moderate in terms of persuading the Fed that more rate hikes are necessary For what its worth the Treasury and Fed funds futures markets agree The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,82,2023-10-22,3

35,The Fed Preview: 'Wait-And-See' Is Like Playing With Fire,The Feds recent interest rate hiking campaign is now finished at least based on the consensus market expectations embedded in the Federal Funds futuresThe Fed is widely expected to hold the Federal Funds rateThe Fed also held interest rates at the  meeting and indicated in the postmeeting statement that it was a datadependent holdHowever the Feds  in Septembers Summary of Economic Projections suggested that the majority of FOMC members expected one additional hike in 2023The only problem with the datadependent approach is that the data does not support the hold The Fed is apparently going to end the interest rate hiking campaign withThe data does not support the hold Even the Taylor Rule Utility by Atlanta Fed suggests that the Federal Funds rate should be somewhere between 575 and 625 The current environment is inflationary and requires a tighter policy rateSo this is not a datadependent approach this is really a waitandsee approach or even better a waitandhope approachThe Fed has inverted the yield curve to bring inflation down to 2 Historically the inverted yield curve is known to cause a recession which ensures that inflation returns to the 2 targetHowever there are lags at which the inverted yield curve affects the economy and generally it takes around 12 months from the initial inversion until a recession The 10Y3m yield curve has been inverted since October 2022  exactly 12 monthsThus the Fed is aware that a recession should be coming soon and its willing to wait for it The data says the economy is running too hot and the policy rate should be even tighter But the Fed is ignoring the data  waiting for the lagged effectsThe Fed has two optionsThe Fed has chosen Option 2  they defined it as the higherforlonger approach which is really a waitandsee or a waitandhope approach The Fed is unwilling to disturb the financial marketsIn fact the recent inflation shock is due to the fact that the Fed was way too slow to react to the postpandemic inflation not to disturb the markets I dont believe that the Fed really saw inflation as transitory  this was also a waitandhope approachThe market could start questioning the Feds commitment to the 2 inflation rates which could result in a spike in longterm interest rates  as the breakeven inflation expectations deanchorNote the FOMC members and the Fed Chair Powell have all strongly indicated that the Fed is committed to the 2 target  they understand the danger But many economists simply dont believe that it would be possible to reach the 2 target without a deep recession  caused by Option 1 from aboveThe 10Y yield can be decomposed as the sum of 1 real rate and 2 breakeven inflation expectations The recent rise in 10Y yields has been caused by the rise in real rates blue line while the inflation expectations red line stayed in a narrow range of 2225Its all about the red line  the inflation expectations If inflation expectations start rising above 25 towards the 3 level that would suggest that the market is questioning the Feds 2 inflation target which could push the 10Y yields towards 55 and probably much higherObviously this would also be a shock to the economy and the markets as it would require the Fed to resume the hiking campaign to catch up with the rising longterm yields and to reanchor inflation expectationsSome are calling to formally increase the inflation target to 3 This would have a similar effect  the inflation expectations would deanchor If you allow 3 inflation why not 4 inflation and so onIn other words the Fed is playing with fire They have been ultradovish and possibly scared to act falling for the softlanding objective which they know is elusiveThe SP 500  is now sitting right at the key longterm support  the red line This was the initial resistance that was broken on June 1st and caused the summer rally which,0,2023-10-25,1

43,"Stock Market: We Ain't Crashing, And Here's Why",Market commentators including some writers on Seeking Alpha are stepping up quantity and intensity of crash predictions I understand analysts like to point at concerning 1 signals in technical analysis 2 events in the Middle East and broader global geopolitical tensions 3 inflationTechnical analysis is a methodology that involves studying historical stock price and volume data with the goal of predicting future price movements With that said a look at the SP 500 chart reveals a concerning situationIgnore technical analysis if you want to make money with stocks Thats right go ahead close those charts wave goodbye to those oscillators and toss those Fibonacci lines into the trash As I see it and you may of course agree technical analysis doesnt predict future events or factors that may affect stock prices such as economic developments or company performance I have a feeling that technical analysis predicted 78 out of the past 3 crashes Moreover technical interpretation of charts and patterns can vary between analysts leading to very subjective judgments Whatever I argued above on a monthly weekly and daily basis is likely not be echoed by another student of chartsAs a key argument for a stock market crash market commentators like to point to the risk brought about by the recent outbreak of fighting in Israel and Hamas Reasons for concern include potential for geopolitical tensions as well as a probable oil price rally on supply chain disruptions However most of the concerns relate to a broader conflict in the Middle East beyond Israel and Hamas that engages the US and Iran in a proxy war As I see it this consideration is more of a tailrisk rather than reasonable future projections And prematurely responding to this with a stock market crash would be nothing short of stupidMoreover while the conflict in the Middle East is very unfortunate from a market perspective there is little argument for concern In a previous article I have  what happened to US equities during major Middle East conflicts covering 1 the SixDay War of 1967 2 the Gulf War 19901991 3 the Iraq War 20032011 and 4 the Arab Spring 20102011 The takeaway was quite consistent Stocks are do not show a tendency to go bearish on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East In fact following an initial period of elevated market volatility US equities like to make new highs within 1218 months from the conflict outbreakMarkets are forward looking Markets are rarely interested in trends that happened in the past What is interesting to markets is the rate of change And as I observe it the rate of change in both inflation and interest rates is favorable Latest data points on core inflation show the CPI trending towards 3 YoY growth Meanwhile wage growth is dropping towards the 50year historical average of 4 YoY These easing pressure points on pricing contribute to a favorable rates outlook as by JP Morgan With this context investors should consider that if the aggressive  past hiking path in interest rates didnt crash the markets although it did in 2021 then the next leg in the path forward namely rates going down wont do it eitherAdmittedly even though inflationary headwinds and rates pressure are easing the high implied time value of money is still a concern to many investors However investors concern on rates will likely be a headwind to upside it wont be a catalyst for downside And what I am saying in this article is not that we are rallying but that we aint crashingFinally investors are concerned about the valuation of the SP 500 citing an implied 2024 PE of close to 18x But I have a very hard time buying the valuation story First I point out that on an aggregate level the valuation of US equities is relatively in line with historical metricsIn that context the graph below provides a comparative assessment of major asset classes and styles in relation to,22,2023-10-28,2

47,Here's Why Costco Can Continue To Beat The Market Despite Rich Valuation,Costco Wholesale  is a confusing company in the investment world as investors struggle to find the right balance between its very high quality and its extraordinarily high valuation While some argue that the nearly 40x PE leaves no roomSo lets dig deeper into Costcos business model and assess whether its current valuation still leaves room for marketbeating returnsConsider the following two companies The first trades at a 5x multiple over its last twelve months earnings and the second trades at a 40x multiple If that was the only information you had about those two companies which one would you have picked to add to your portfolioNow consider that the first company is someThe second company sells goods that are essential to human lives and for the cheapest price possible You know that in 10 years people will still eat drink buy electronics and drugs drive cars and need furniture You also know that even if material changes happen to human behavior this company can always change its product mix accordingly Furthermore its infrastructure geographic presence and culture are second to none and it has a proven track record of being able to expand internationallyAt this point most investors will have only two answers either they buy neither of the companies or they buy the secondWere not done yet though Consider that the second company grew its EPS at a doubledigit rate in almost every year of its existence Even if you think it has reached some kind of saturation in its main markets it has proven that its samestore growth rate is steady in the highsingledigit range This means that with very high certainty you might be paying 40x LTM earnings but less than 30x over its 2025 earningsThe second company obviously is the story of Costco and while you might think that you should wait for a dip or you might think that there will be better opportunities to initiate a position keep in mind that Costco is currently trading at its 5year average multiple And if you bought at almost any point during the last 5 years at that average multiple you had probably generated very decent returnsSo lets dive deeper into Costco and what makes its business unparalleled to noneLets not overcomplicate this Costcos business model is amazingly simple You pay an annual fee to become a member and being a member grants you access to shop in Costcos warehouses which generally sell goods in bulk for arguably the cheapest price possible and with the most welcoming return policy in the worldThe advantages for the consumer are clear low prices on their essential purchases and good service For Costco some advantages are more clear than others First they usually receive the membership fee payments in advance enabling a favorable cash cycle Second those membership fees by themselves are essentially carrying near100 margins Third being a member creates loyalty  youre more likely to shop in a place where you paid for membership Fourth the membership system reduces shrinkage theft as members dont want to be banned and the warehouses are already built to check each entrantCostco has  membership options namely Executive Business and Gold StarIn FY23 Costco generated 46 billion in revenues from membership fees As of the last quarter Costco had 71 million paying members households with 1279 million cardholders Executive members represent a little over 45 of members and grew over 3 in the fourth quarter alone Renewal rates in North America were 927 and topped 900 worldwide for the second year in a rowOne thing of note is that Costco usually raises its membership fees once every five years However as a company that sees providing value to customers as its number one competitive advantage Costco is already late by more than six months as it is trying to postpone the increase to a more convenient macro environment for its customers More on that in the margin,64,2023-10-09,8

50,My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,Through September the economy remains solid but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead Currently with the funds rate at 55 and the core CPI at 41 the real funds rate is 14 ThatThe Fed can resume its finetuning operation later if the need arises but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go Ill agree that the bulk of the Feds work is done BUT I dont believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a lastminute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded The firstever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mixraising the odds of a government shutdown in midNovember While this situation wont affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that willThe political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics fiscal spending and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors rating agencies and voters Now to be fair the governments deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yieldsthe markets way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order And the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the governments outofcontrol spending the worse the situation will getIn an era of low inflation and zerolow interest rates Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10year Treasury yield now hovering around 49 With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road fiscal austerity would become a nearterm headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates However that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2 target so this growthinflationinterest rate issue isnt going to be so easy to solve However as I will explain later an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced beforeThe auto workers union is making in my opinion some outrageous demands They are asking for a 40 increase in wages over 4 years a 20 reduction in the workweek from 400 to 320 hours and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of allelectric vehicles The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands poisoned any goodfaith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainableAt the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rankandfile union members The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President Against this background it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly As it progresses the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparentWhile investors seem to be pricing a soft landing history is not on their side The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history and the market is still trying to absorb the impact This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by nearterm macro events As rates have spiked so too have longterm yieldsYield spreads also bear monitoring The spread or difference between 2year and 10year Treasury yields has been negative all year ie an inverted y,59,2023-10-06,3

57,Orion Office REIT: A Speculative Buy Once The Selling Pressure Subsides,To buy or not to buy that is the question If the answer is buy then a strategy is needed   is a brand new company that first existed as a publicMr Market is not a bigThe stock price has been dropping like a brick which has scared many investors away Obviously those that sold at the spinoff are very likely glad they did But the rout has continued What is unanswered is whether the chart below indicates that the pressure on the stock price is abating which is what it looks like or is the stock just taking a breather before the next leg downHistorically spinoffs tend to outperform the market over time However the real estate investment trust or REIT sector in particular has had a number of failures in a row that seem to indicate at least a temporary exception to history This was particularly true in fiscal year 2020 when things took an unexpectedly grim turn for a lot of businessesThe chart above clearly shows that a rout is underway Like any other time Mr Market gets going it is best in the immediate term to let something like this run its courseBut long term the question of the ability of the company to survive and even thrive is on the table Obviously Mr Market is voting with both feet for a failure But if Realty Income spun this off the reputation could be damaged by an eventual subsidiary reorganization after a spinoff Especially if such an event happened sooner rather than later It can affect a later spinoff if that prospect arisesEven if the company struggled for years and then finally gave up the ghost either through being acquired or any other solution that would probably not look goodRealty Income to its credit did isolate these assets and get them out of the company portfolio and was able to continue the steady dividend progress and growth The hope of course is for a better stock price performance when the Realty Income stock gets out of the doghouse that Mr Market put the stock price in Clearly these office building assets are not perceived to be the best in the industry But that can changeThis market is clearly seeing some negative viewpoints and not giving management much credit for being able to resolve the issues despite the experience of managementClearly there is  about all the renewals that need to happen in fiscal year 2025 considering the conditions right now That is very clearly a lot of business that needs to be successfully concludedThe success of maintaining a high occupancy rate is very dependent upon location and management flexibility to tenant needsOn the other hand the company has clearly located several growth areas This may mean that even areas that are not obviously growth areas to the average investor may be well located in states like New York for exampleManagement further emphasizes mission critical locations and companies that lease the properties The results so far appear to bear out what management is stating However the lack of a public track record is likely to make the stock very volatile especially downward to provide a potential bargain opportunity for those that believe in both the superior locations aspect as well as the mission critical partThe fact that Realty Income spun off these assets may at least demonstrate that management believed that the market could care less about mission critical and superior locations for the time being It may be a more substantial belief than that Against that you have a very experienced management willing to guide the new companyIn addition to the worries about all those leases expiring there is the worry about refinancing the debt Based upon the stock price action shown above it looks as though the market is just worrying itself to death over these two issuesMost investors are worried about having to roll over any to maybe all of the debt in a higher interest rate environment This is where the ability to recover increased costs through a higher lease payment in the fu,37,2023-09-15,0

60,Virgin Galactic: Using Your Money To Subsidize The Adventures Of Billionaires,The sharp rise in interest rates has led to a decisive shift in market and economic sentiment The cost of money was virtually free over the period extending from the initial QE and bailout responses in 2009 to the end of 2021 WithHowever the financial market regime changed dramaticallyThis sharp change is great news for investors because lowerrisk assets have much higher returns However it is potentially a death sentence for those companies still totally reliant on external financing Companies that seek external money today through equity and debt financing are now paying far more because investors and banks have far superior riskreward avenues Further for those seeing their stock price decline due to increased financing risks bankruptcy is an increasingly likely occurrence when equitydilution financing becomes untenableI believe Virgin Galactic  is an excellent case of this issue The stock has lost around half of its value this year and has lost over 90 of its value since the 20202021 free money era Its market capitalization has sunk to an abysmal 630M while its short interest has risen to an alarming 23 signaling immense speculative bets against the company Its forward EPS is 180 but its share price is 175 so it cannot offset losses with equity sales unless the stock has another strong dead cat bounce Of course Virgin Galactic continues to float the dream of space tourism with  outlooks suggesting profitability around 2027 though that date has long been delayed I think the company will either need to prove itself soon or will never meet this goalVirgin Galactics business plan hinges upon a highly idealistic view As investors it is critical to balance the idealistic potential of creative dreams with realistic needs limits and trends Personally as an analyst I am biased toward realism but that may not always serve considering companies like Tesla  lost money for around fifteen years while focusing on idealistic goals until very recently achieving those dreams on a large scale That said I believe Virgin Galactic is a far more idealistic dream than Tesla considering the path to middleclass use of EVs is far more realistic than middleclass use of space travel Fundamentally Virgin Galactic is a business catered solely to wealthy people  It will likely be some decades before that price comes down to a more reasonable levelFurthermore a fundamental basis for my view regarding Virgin Galactic stems from the shift in social sentiment around and following 2020 Since then  there has been less public interest in idealistic dreams and more public interest in meeting the immediate challenges facing most people Companies that can make inventions to lower living costs have a significant edge in this environment while those producing inventions only accessible to a few people do not An interesting  showed that over threequarters of UK people believed wealthy people such as Richard Branson Virgin Galactics founder should focus their resources on problems facing Earth like climate change before space travel Companies make money both by selling dreams and solving realworld issues In eras of abundance the longterm dreamers have an advantage while in more challenging economic periods those solving realworld problems seem toOf course while there are surveys that show the shift in public sentiment it is not entirely provable That said it is critical regarding Virgin Galactic because the company can only exist if investors are willing to subsidize its immense losses Investors give money to the company and the company uses that money to offset losses on tourism flights for ultrawealthy people Thus to an extent many middleclass investors are essentially funding the whimsical desires of extremely wealthy people To me there is nothing wrong with wealthy people going to space as that is usually the first step in broader use only that SPCE investors shoul,2,2023-10-27,0

62,S&P 500 Will Likely Underperform And 5% Money Markets Are NOT The Answer,Dear readersIve been writing articles on the site for a better part of this year and the single most frequent comment I get especially on REIT stocks which I cover has beenAnd it is a fair question to askAfterall 5 isnt too far from most conservative investors 8 goal and a riskfree return seems very attractive when you see markets crashing left and rightToday I want to discuss why I believe waiting in market money funds is NOT the answer I also want to discuss two alternatives  the allmighty   and  Lets start with my expectations for the SP 500 which hold even more true forOf course weve seen the AI trend playout but I fear that technology stocks are currently Growth is historically expensive relative to value and technology stocks trade at forward PE 20 higher than the average between 1997 and today It seems as though valuations have not adjusted to a higher rate environment at allExpensive growth stocks have led to the index being relatively over priced as well at a forward PE of 178x Historically speaking a forward PE of 178x tends to result in average total returns of around 5 over the next 5 years This 5 should come from a 16 dividend yield and about 34 of price appreciationTo make things worse JPMorgans   only looks at the period from 1997 forward During a large part of this period interest rates have been near zero which could have and frankly did inflated the average PE multiple So now that rates are above 5 and unlike to come back to zero anytime soon actual future performance of the index could be even worse than the 5 suggested by this modelA sub5 total return over the next 5 years isnt very exciting especially in a high 3 inflation environment and begs the questionOver the shortterm sure For money that will be needed over the next couple of years and will be spent and not reinvested there is absolutely nothing wrong with buying money market funds and other fixed income instruments to generate at least some yield In fact this is something that should be doneBut over the longterm which is what we focus on when investing the answer is in theory no because yield from money markets tends to be shortlived and eventually the money will have to be reinvested By then interest rates will have likely dropped and prices of stocks will have risen substantially leading to massive opportunity costIn reality however it doesnt always playout like this Lets look at some examples from historyIn some cases such as 2000 and 2008 the strategy of waiting in money market funds at peak rates paid off and investors were actually able to invest their money into the market at lower valuations once rates droppedBut in 1990s 1995 and most recently 2020 the strategy failed terribly as the index soared by 50100 before rates bottomed out Those waiting in money markets would have missed the entire rallyThe truth is that none of us know whats going to happen this time around we simply cant time the market and we shouldnt try to But that doesnt mean that we should settle for money market funds which have historically failed to beat inflation especially post2000The bottom line is that the SP 500 isnt positioned to deliver the 10 annual returns weve seen over the past decade but waiting in treasuries isnt a sure fire strategy either as inflation is likely to take most of our nominal returns while we wait and we risk missing substantial upside in stocks over the longterm horizonMy strategy at the moment is to avoid expensive stocks that havent repriced for the high interest rate environment and invest into those that have I look for beatup companies where sentiment is low despite strong balance sheets growing cash flows with pricing power and high dividendsSome might argue that its better to buy recent winners and sell recent losers Im doing the opposite But isnt that the name of the game Buying when others are fearful,15,2023-09-14,0

64,A Short-Term Buying Opportunity Has Arrived - Use TQQQ For Market Leverage,Two indicators we follow suggest the threeweek market correction is over and a rally is about to begin The rally should last a minimum of four weeks probably longer One indicator suggests the major market index to use is the QQQ or leveragedBecause of the shortterm duration of the expected move we feel its ideal for the ProShares 3x QQQ symbol  TQQQ This ETF was designed specifically for shortterm trades like this since the major risks in leveraged ETFs other than increased volatility come from the carrying costs of holding them long termEssentially we think the market is about to start a longterm topping process of the advance that started last October During a topping process there will be trading opportunities like the one we currently see Shortterm strategic investments like this can help increase the low buyTrading opportunities are best found using indicators that measure investor activity and investor expectations In the current situation the indicators are the puts to calls ratio and the Hulbert survey of NASDAQ newsletter writers We believe the current situation presents a wonderful opportunity to show how these indicators are used to trade the market  no guarantees of courseThe CBOE equity puts to calls ratio measures what option speculators expect the market to do It has a history that goes back to 1974 A high ratio means too many speculators are expecting prices to decline and history shows prices will generally move opposite that expectation Its contrary opinion in action In the chart we indicated with arrows three moments when high ratios represented major bear market lowsAt this time however were using the ratio to help find the end of a correction and weve circled the recent rise in the ratio from 50 to 80 to show the current situation This is one of the highest ratios in history To us this rapid increase in bearish expectations generating one of the highest ratios in recent history is a strong sign the correction is endingThe next chart shows the Hulbert survey of NASDAQ newsletter writers The survey has a history back to 2000This chart measures the percentage of newsletter writers who are bullish on the NASDAQ index versus those who are bearish The zero line represents when theyre equalNotice after reaching an extreme of 80 a few weeks ago the ratio has been rapidly rising and is now back to the zero line Weve indicated it with a green oval and also point with black arrows moments when this occurred in the past during a rising market More often than not they signaled shortterm buying opportunitiesWe believe this metric confirms what the puts and calls ratio is indicating  that the threeweek decline is ending and a shortterm rally in QQQ is about to startThe chart below graphs TQQQ over the last two years It highlights why TQQQ is not a good investment over the long term It is however good for what it was intended to profit from market moves expected to last from a few days to a few weeksThe red numbers 1 and 2 show the current price compared to a year ago and highlight why TQQQ is not a good longterm investment While QQQ is down only 10 from the highs made two years ago this 3X ETF is down over 50 This massive erosion in value is due to the high carrying costs of maintaining 3X leverage This erosion in value is timedependent however and not a major risk when making a fourweek tradeThe green curve at the bottom is the relative strength of TQQQ and its currently at a level reached black circle before the start of many short term rallies The last time it was this low was January 2023 at the start of its rallyThis is the third indicator supporting the idea that the correction is over and the market about to begin a rally of at least four weeks A rally in TQQQ just back to the high made three weeks ago would be a gain of 18Its our opinion the best strategy to use in the current situation is to invest 23 now then,49,2023-10-19,0
65,Energy Transfer: An Old Adversary Threatens A Material Future Change,Energy Transfer  has had a quiet time since the Army Corps was ordered to come up with a new study on the effects of the DAPL pipeline That has led more than a few investors to think thatMaking matters dicier was the fact that theNow it looks like the process will again get going One of the main issues in the past included the Energy Transfer operator record in Pennsylvania Those issues are now settled and a matter of record How those results weigh into what is about to happen is another matterHere is the note from Phillips 66 Partners which is now part of Phillips 66 Source Phillips 66 Partners Since Phillips 66 Partnership was the smallest partner in the DAPL partnership and was its own legal entity at the time there was a good deal more detail on the ongoing dispute in the legal filings of this entity until it was merged into Phillips 66 This management stated in several conference calls that they expected the court fight to continue for yearsThe problem was that everything died down until the latest study was complete There really was nothing legal to be done until the results became public Now it appears there will be a period of public commenting before the next step That means that any court filings are likely to happen next yearThe key is that as the operator of this partnership this news is likely to overshadow anything else Energy Transfer does and the uncertainty surrounding this issue is one significant reason that the partnership common units are considered cheap and are likely to stay cheap until this issue is resolvedThose of us who have followed Energy Transfer long term know that the record here is probably on the minimal side from all these issues that are likely to detract from profitabilityAs the Seeking Alpha website shows this is one of the least profitable operators in the industry It is also very large and investment grade A court case like this if it goes in a big time unfavorable direction could have a material impact on the future of the company overnightOne of the things about the Quant system is that it is primarily a numbers system There is really no impact on a system like this for something like the DAPL case that is really a footnote in most official reports The only real cost at the current time is legal fees which are likely to be very small compared to the operations of a big company like thisTherefore the quant system is really unable to forecast the effects of a potential liability like this Instead evaluating the liability is a qualitative process Once the court case is decided and all appeals and other motions have been dealt with then there will be considerably more certainty to the outlook that something like that quant system can deal withStill the system has a hold rating on the common units This does indicate some trepidation in the market that likely relates to the uncertainty of all options listed in the Army Corps of Engineers report studyOne of the things that investors nearly always underestimate is risk David Dreman in his latest book Contrarian Investment Strategy The Psychological Edge has noted this But so have many other authorsThe mathematical argument would be something like thisThe reason is that many will go for Case 2 because the returns look good until a loss year happens Many times that loss year is far in excess of the 25 shown But many investors assume that year will not happen because it did not in the pastFor me I have followed many examples like this The latest of those was my coverage of California Resources  up until the bankruptcy  year 2020 The comments to my articles clearly state that the company had valuable land that would get it out of trouble Alternatively the company had a lot of reserves behind each share never mind that no one reviewed the high cost of those reserves or lack of profitability of the company compared to debt levelsSo when California Resources soared before ,49,2023-08-18,0

67,Disney: Cost Cutting And Dissipating Negative Sentiment Provide Tailwinds For Stock Appreciation,Remember when The Walt Disney Company  could do no wrong Maybe I am being nostalgic but I have so many positive memories of Disney Even a decade ago everything that Disney did or bought just seemed toThis virtuous cycle saw Disneys shares shoot to the moon and peak in 2021 at over 200 Since then things have changed and Disney has been in a free fall both in regards to share price and how people view the company This combined with high costs caused shares to fall all the way to its current value of around 88 We believe that sentiment has reached an inflection point and the good times will come againJudging Disneys value is a difficult task From its theme parks to its media and sports entertainment empire DisneyIt would be impossible in the confines of a short article to break down everything about Disney Each individual company within Disney could be its own article However we feel comfortable looking at the overall sentiment of the company and an overview of the financials to determine an approximate intrinsic value for this giant companySince 2018 Disney has grown assets from 98 billion to 204 billion During this period Liabilities have increased from 44 billion to 94 billion The growth in the spread between assets and liabilities has increased from 54 billion to 110 billionThis impressive growth has happened while Disney was experiencing a lot of criticism and the share price has reflected this drop in sentiment as well as the impact of the pandemicBut Disneys growth is not just for growing sake Disney has been committed to growing revenues and profits as wellRevenues have also grown considerably but so have costs We believe that the recent cost cutting steps taken by the current CEO will significantly improve profitability The job cuts we discuss below show that Disney is not only aware of its problems but that Disney has also taken the necessary steps to correct them We believe the fair value of Disney to be between 150 and 215 This represents a significant discount at its current priceWe believe the main reason that Disney has fallen is because of sentiment Sometimes Disneys commitment to growth has led to controversy and sometimes the controversies have come out of left field These controversies have seemingly snowballed over the last five years causing Disney to appear to be under attack The combination of controversy and excessive costs have been a headwind for the last five years and have been a drag on its shares value Below we will look at how the sentiment of Disney shares has been impacted by these controversiesSince 2018 Disney Heiress Abigail Disney has criticized Disney for various reasons related to the companys business practices and corporate governance One of the main concerns raised by the heiress is the issue of income inequality and executive compensation within the company During a 2019 interview she criticized Disneys executive compensation If your CEO salary is at the 700 600 500 times your median workers pay there is nobody on Earth  Jesus Christ himself isnt worth 500 times his median workers pay She has repeatedly expressed how Disneys top executives receive exorbitant pay packages while many lowerlevel employees struggle to make a living wage This criticism aligns with the broader societal debate on income inequality and the fairness of executive compensation in large corporations It also put Disney in the crosshairs of liberal politicians and made it a central focus of the US culture warsShe didnt stop her criticisms there though she also raised concerns about Disneys environmental and social impact She has pointed out that the companys theme parks generate substantial waste and its reliance on singleuse plastics is detrimental to the environment Furthermore there have been concerns about the treatment of workers in Disneys supply chain particularly in countries with weaker labor protections All of these issues ta,465,2023-10-12,0

77,What Do The Markets Believe About The War?,We arent geopolitical experts and do not know howAt the time of the Hamas attack on Israel the oil market was slightly oversold due to a price plunge over the preceding week Consequently at least a countertrend rebound was likely regardless of newsDuring the three trading days after the war news hit the wires 9th11th October the oil price bounced and then pulled back We wrote in the 11th October Interim Update that this price action suggested an expectation among large oil traders that the conflict would not broaden or that if it did broaden then Saudi Arabia would act to offset any loss of oil from IranThe subsequent price action indicates that the oil market has not changed its mind We say this because the rebound in the oil price from its prewarnews low looks more like a countertrend reaction than the start of a move to above the September2023 high Also the extent of the backwardation in the oil futures market has decreased over the past week which suggests less urgency to stockup on physical oilIn summary the oil market does not believe that the war will have a significant negative effect on global oil supplyPrior to the war news hitting the wires the gold market was very oversold in both momentum and sentiment terms and therefore was poised for a rebound As a result of the war news the rebound has been much stronger than it otherwise would have beenThe performance of the US gold price indicates that large speculators initially were uncertain as to how big the war would become Would it be confined to Israel versus Hamas inaround Gaza or would it expand to encompass direct involvement from the US and Iran Also how much additional US government spending would result from the war in the Middle East and how would this spending affect the resources directed towards the NATORussia war in UkraineAt the moment large speculators in the gold market believe that these are open questions with a substantial expansion of the war being one of the more likely scenarios Thats a reasonable conclusion because the gold price continues to hover around resistance at US19802000  about 180 above where it was three weeks agoWell know that the perceived level of uncertaintyrisk has increased significantly if the gold price breaks above US2000 By the same token well know that the perceived level of uncertaintyrisk has begun to wane when there is a clear downward reversal in the US gold price Note that a downward reversal in the US gold price is likely to precede a turn for the better in the news from the Middle EastIn the US stock market the war has prompted a shift away from risk but has been very much a secondary issue The primary issue is the downward trend in the bond market the upward trend in longdated Treasury yieldsIn earlyOctober the Dollar Index  was very overbought and had just begun to correct The war news may have reduced the magnitude of the correction but up until now has not been sufficient to propel the DX above its earlyOctober highAs far as we can tell according to the currency market the outbreak of war in the Middle East has increased the attractiveness of the US relative to other fiat currencies but also added to concerns about the pace at which the US government is going into debt Putting it another way whats priced into the currency market at the moment is both the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the war and the offsetting consideration that the war is increasing the risk of a US government debt spiralSummarising all of the above the oil market is not concerned about a significant supply disruption the gold market has pricedin considerable uncertaintyrisk and could pricein more of the same before reversing the US stock market is more concerned about bond yields than about the Middle East and the currency market thinks that the benefits of holding the US in a period of increasing geopolitical instability are being mostly offset by the like,2,2023-10-28,0

86,"NextEra Energy Partners: Is It Always Darkest Before Dawn, Or Pitch Black?",Over the past seven trading days the NextEra Energy Partners  unit price has fallen off a cliffAnalysts on Seeking Alpha and from numerous mainstream investment research groups have been piling on the gloomIn this article we will take a look at whether or not the dramatic stock price decline is justified by fundamentals and then offer our verdict on whether investors should get out before the lights at NEP go pitch black or if NEP has a good chance ofYes the market was likely not happy about the rough halving of the distribution growth guidance at NEP though no one who knew 1 where interest rates were 2 where its equity price was trading even before it recently lost half of its market value and 3 the sheer magnitude of its upcoming wall of CEPF and debt maturities believed that NEP was likely to achieve its lofty 12 distribution CAGR guidanceMoreover negative market sentiment was likely spurred further by the slew of downgrades and steep price target reductions from previously bullish mainstream investment analysts However based on the analysts commentary in most cases many of these downgrades seemed to be at least partially driven by chasing market sentiment rather than truly driven by fundamental analysis of the company itselfThe real reason for the selloff in the stock price  in our view  was the vicious cycle created by two major factorsThe main factor preventing NEE from rolling up NEP at this point is that it wants to limit its direct exposure to renewables in order to keep regulated assets at a higher percentage and therefore make the credit ratings agencies happy Could they eventually decide that they are going to roll up NEP anyway Absolutely However NEE has made it clear that an independent and healthy NEP is important to them being able to achieve their longterm growth goals by being able to develop and dropdown renewable assets to NEP thereby generating attractive profits for NEE via its renewables development business while also preserving its regulatedrenewables balance to protect its credit rating and retain a relatively attractive cost of debt capital so they are likely going to do everything they can to revive NEPs growth story before resorting to a rollupAs a result our view is that NEE is likely going to give NEP at least a few more years to try to recover an attractive cost of capital If those efforts fail  especially if NEP faces a choice between a distribution cut or financial distress  NEE could very likely go down the path of reabsorbing NEP This is a scenario that likely means that the current unit price decline is a case of it being darkest before pitch blackThat said we believe that there is still a very viable path for NEP to return to prosperity and that it could very well be darkest before dawn Here is the mathAfter Q1 management was expecting a December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA of 24172617 million based on the following assumptionsSince then the announced potential sale of their STX pipeline and the cancelation of an expected dropdown from their parent NextEra Energy  overwhelmed their other growth initiatives to reduce their December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA by nearly 500 million to 19302130 millionOn the positive side corporate expenses have declined by an expected 10 million and the IDR fees of 157 million have been suspended for the foreseeable future reducing the hit to the December 31 2023 runrate NEPlevel adjusted EBITDA to 320 million or 19002100 million Moreover debt service expense has also been reduced substantially given that the STX debt will be taken out and the expected debt costs on the dropdown asset also do not apply so that improves the midpoint of estimated pretax CAFD by another 135 million PreTax Tax Credit deductions also declined by 135 million at the midpoint NonCash Income deductions declined by 5 million at the midpoint and Main,54,2023-10-04,0

96,My View Of Wall Street: A Disturbing Macro Scene,It is no secret that many of theSpeaking of a challenge the Fed has been left with a nearimpossible task They are trying to come up with a solution that measures the right amount of restraint needed to bring inflation back was once believed to be a temporary issue beginning in 2021 but the inflation rate defied those forecasts and climbed until reaching a peak in March 2022 The Fed says it is determined to get it back to the 20 mark but it does not   some four years after inflation began to move higher Weve already seen the effects Higher prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services  gasoline food shelter cars hotel room rates and restaurantsThese price increases arent going away anytime soon It would be foolish to believe we wont see this issue having an impact well into next year and perhaps well beyond that The Feds goal is 2 but getting inflation back down to the 20 mark is not good enough  to counter some of the cumulative buildup from the longlasting runup in inflation The Fed will surely stay on course higher for longer but they are once again stuck I doubt the Fed can loosen the reins even after inflation hits its target as they will have to wait until this runup in inflation is reversedInflation spares no one It erodes the consumers purchasing power Unfortunately the ones hurt the most are those at the lower end of the income scale and those relying on a fixed income They cannot easily avoid rising food and energy prices and higher rent which consume a very large portion of their takehome pay The warnings were there Excessive and as it turned out all of the added unnecessary spending to right an economy that was already right may remain a problem that can haunt the MACRO scene for a whileI do not agree with some market pundits assessments that the economy is less interest ratesensitive than it has been in the past Their claim is relatively speaking interest rates are not high when compared to history They have a point but that argument stops there Weve seen how equities  reacted to any movement in the 10year treasury note Its been the speed of these increases that kills their argument If that isnt enough after years of zero interest rates the market will t but this adjustment period will take time There is also another unknown that not many are talking about We have a large contingent of money managers and investors who have never been invested in a stock market where interest rates are moving higher How they are reacting and how they will act when rates dont come down tomorrow is yet to be determinedSo as a result I think it is premature to predict a soft nonrecessionary landing and all systems go for a rousing BULL market With multiple headwinds building on the horizon a recession is more likely How mild it is remains unanswered However if the Fed loses its patience or overstays its welcome some believe they already have the downturn could be more protracted than some of the forecasters expect Ill note that the forecasters referred to in the last statement have dwindled to a scant fewWhat drives the US economy is Consumer spending which makes up nearly 70 of the GDP With the strong labor market good wage improvements and all the pandemic stimulus they could ever want consumers have danced their way through the Feds aggressive rate hikes and higher borrowing costs However there are a few reasons why we can expect things to change For starters the labor market is softening Second excess savings from the pandemic are swindling so consumers no longer have a cushion to support their spending Third with student loan payments set to resume on October 1 likely to subtract 04 from consumer spending in 24 and gas prices rising as oil prices move higher from 68bbl to 90bbl consumers should have less discretionary income to spend going forward There is a positive they do have a job and as l,262,2023-10-14,0
97,Canadian National Railway: Why I've Been Buying This Wide Moat Compounder,In this report Im going to break down a change in philosophy that Ive had with regard to stock selection Im going to highlight why Ive been buying so much Canadian National Railway  recently And Ill break down whyAnyone who follows my portfolio closely knows that Ive become borderline obsessed with what I call compounders  companies that grow their cash flows in a very rapid and reliable fashionBut it wasnt always that wayWhen I began my dividend growth journey I gravitated towards aMy goal was to seek out wide margins of safety relying on the combination of fundamental growth dividend yield and mostly multiple expansion via mean reversion to generate my returns over timeI knew that when buying cheaper stocks not only was I increasing my upside potential via mean reversion but also locking in a higher yield on cost lower share prices equal higher dividend yieldsThis is a winwin scenario for someone like me who is looking to produce reliably increasing passive income alongside market beating returnsAnd without a doubt this value oriented dividendcentric strategy workedIve done well over the years and I thank the old guard of dividend growth investors who essentially founded the community here on Seeking Alpha more than a decade ago for their guidanceEarly on in my investing career I stumped upon authors like David Van Knapp David Fish Chowder and Chuck Carnevale all these years ago and bought into the strategies they were presenting wholeheartedlyI never really been interested in speculating in the markets I hate losing more than I love winningFrom the start I knew that getrichquick schemes were a waste of timeI also recognized that as a young man time was my greatest resource in terms of generating wealthIt was easy to understand the benefits of benevolent compound interest as opposed to the negative type associated with high yield debt and credit cards that so many individuals hate and I loved the idea of the dividend snowball effectI knew this strategy would require patience and discipline however it was easy to buy into the longterm ownership of stocks when I knew that I was accumulating shares of the highest quality companies on Earth simply put reliable dividend growth doesnt happen by accident companies with decades long dividend increase streaks have proven themselves to be market leaders by producing strong fundamental growth over the longtermNow more than a decade into my dividend growth journey with the trendline curve of my passive income turning parabolic I couldnt be more grateful for the early guidance that these men providedWhen I started to get serious about investing I also gravitated towards the writing of Warren BuffettLearning from the worlds greatest investor seemed like a reasonable enough place to startHis annual letters to shareholders are freely available on Berkshire Hathaways website dating all the way back to 1977 Theyre chock full of all of the information that an investor would ever need to know about becoming a value investor And best of all theyre totally freeBuffett began his career talking about deep value opportunities and still to this day preaches the importance of margin of safetyIll always hold traditional value investing principles near and dear to my heart however over the years Ive realized that I prefer to rely on reliably growing fundamentals and the compounding process that they facilitate as opposed to the change in market sentiment that results in multiple expansion when it comes to lower growth or even nogrowth deep value stocksDespite my success I have to admit that value investing isnt without its faultsIts possible to become obsessed with valuewith deep discountswith that wide juicy attractive margin of safetyThe problem issometimes stocks are cheap for a good reasonSometimes the allure of the bargain barrel can play tricks on the mind causing investors to overlook red flag,52,2023-08-04,0

103,BANX: Diving Further Into This Fund,Earlier last month we gave ArrowMark Financial Corp  a  We had noted the strong and growing income the fund was throwing off and that a raiseIt only took a few hours for that to become true as later in the day they  the quarterly dividend from 039 to 045 That was good for a 154 increaseAround a week later they followed that up with the announcement of the yearend special This was expected because they were still earning a significant amount of income Due to regulations of their structure as a regulated investment company they are still earning too much income in their underlying portfolio and would be subject to an excise tax they paid out a small bitSome websites CEFConnect in particular are showing that the 042 is the regular distribution now when it was only a special That could be causing some confusion as it made it appear like they raised their payout but then immediately lowered it With that the distribution rate for the fund based on the regular dividend and the last closing share price puts the yield at a compelling 105The  is still coming up on October 19th However for the latest quarterly payout the exdividend date was September 21st When the fund initially announced the increase it actually shot quite a bit higher but has sunk lower after that initial enthusiasm The overall market is sinking through September and thats holding up its reputation as the worst month which is most definitely not helping investor sentimentAt the same time the funds share price against its last reported NAV provides for an estimated discount of 1981 That makes it still a really attractive deal on the market today with a high distribution rate that is easily being covered It is so well covered that they need to pay out specialsWith all that being said I wanted to provide a brief update today because I was able to have a video conference with This included the Chairman  CEO who is also the portfolio manager Sanjai Bhonsle In addition Patrick Farrell the CFO and Dana Staggs the President In addition the  of Destra Capital Destra runs the investor relations and marketing for shareholders of BANX as well as partnering with other popular closedend fund sponsors to offer these shareholder servicesDespite being a more casual impromptu video call there were a few questions that I thought were particularly interesting that could be shared with investors of BANX that they also might find helpfulOne of the first questions I had was on their  These abruptly ended after Q3 2022 I was wondering if they were looking to provide any more financial information quarterly as generally speaking the more information the better to make better decisionsThe response was that when doing these quarterly calls they felt they were looked at more like a business development company They had noted they felt that investors were looking at them more like a BDC and they felt that included delivering potential capital appreciation as well as the distributionHowever their main goal is to keep NAV as steady as possible and deliver a sustainable and solid dividend yield to investors Which is something theyve been able to deliver on If you look at their historical NAV its one of the more straight lines youll seeHowever do note that they only took over this fund around 2020 and started really changing the investment focus to regulatory capital relief securities more details on those in a minute after thatWhile there are inevitably going to be some increases and decreases in the valuations of their underlying portfolio the outlook for returns going forward is certainly encouraging If they are delivering a 10 distribution yield that is fully covered and they manage to keep their share price flat that means an investor can expect a roughly 10 annual return based on receiving the yield throughout the year on todays prices The dividend rate on the NAV is at 825 So that would be th,587,2023-10-12,0
104,How the stock market fared after the 2011 debt downgrade,Deutsche Bank published two charts Wednesday to put the Fitch decision to downgrade US sovereign debtFitch cut the US longterm debt rating  late TuesdayThe charts show what happened around and after August 5th 2011 whenBefore and after the downgrade the SP 500     slumped the VIX  spiked and Treasuries     actually rallied hard on a flight to quality bid Reid said However circumstances around this period were very differentThe debt ceiling fight and downgrade happened concurrently he said In addition the SP was the first to downgrade the US from AAA and the immediate shock was far more profound than it could be with a second agency doing it 12 years laterIronically at the time the Euro sovereign crisis was bubbling up in the background and Treasuries were seen as a massive safehaven versus the periphery of Europe even with the downgrade This European story was also impacting global equity markets at the timeAlso four days after the downgrade the August FOMC saw a commitment to keep rates at an exceptionally low level until at least mid2013 Reid added This was the first time they had promised to keep rates at near zero for such an extended period Then at the September 21st 2011 FOMC the Fed announced a second round of Operation Twist aimed at selling shortdated securities but buying longer date onesThis continued to help boost the demand for 10yr treasuries  and eventually helped calm US equities and the VIX who by then were more sanguine about the debt downgrade Meanwhile the Italian spread to bunds trended even higher further enhancing the safe haven status of TreasuriesSo a quite different environment to 2011 and one to bear in mind when comparisons are made Reid said,676,2023-10-13,0

113,Netlist: Short Opportunity Following Appeals Court Ruling,Ive been covering chip manufacturer Netlist  on SA since July 2021 and Ive written a total of four articles about it so far The  was in January 2023 and in it I said thatWell Q2 2023 sales slumped by over 80 year on year while the operating loss almost tripled to 143 million On the legal front a federal jury in Texas awarded Netlist over  in a patent infringement case against Samsung  in April 2023 but just last week the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  that the California district court was incorrect in grantingIf you arent familiar with the company or my earlier coverage heres a short description of the business Netlist was established in 2000 and is a supplier of modular memory subsystems that specializes in hybrid memory solutionsYet the vast majority of its sales currently come from the resale of products of South Koreas SK Hynix  The two companies inked a 5year product purchase and supply agreement back in April 2021 after the Korean firm paid Netlist a  license fee to end a lawsuit over patent infringement The issue here is that reselling SK Hynix chips isnt particularly profitable and Netlist hasnt managed to book a positive operating result in a single quarter since the supply agreement was signed With the global chip demand facing a downturn over the past several months Q2 2023 was particularly underwhelming for Netlist with net sales slumping by 819 year on year to 10 million The decrease wasnt concentrated only in the resale of thirdparty products as sales of Netlists proprietary products went down by 768 to just 14 million during the quarterWith the gross profit margin shrinking to 23 and legal fees almost tripling to 9 million the operating loss soared to 143 million during Q2 2023While legal expenses are typically a nonrecurring item I would argue that this isnt the case here as the market valuation of Netlist has been linked more with its intellectual property IP portfolio than its financial results over the past few years While the company claims that its IP has an important role in the artificial intelligence market I think its lawsuits are whats attracting investors hereYou see Netlist has been suing the likes of Samsung Alphabet   and Micron  over patent infringement for several years now The lawsuits against Samsung and Alphabet are mainly linked with US Patent No 7619912 known as the 912 patent that relates generally to technologies to implement rank multiplication while the ones against Micron are over patented RDIMM and LRDIMM technology which also includes the 912 patent Netlist was trading below 100 in 2020 as few people thought these patent infringement lawsuits could go anywhere but the 40 million deal with SK Hynix fueled speculation that similar or more valuable agreements could be coming in the future sending the share price over 900 in 2021 Yet most of the license fee has already been spent on mounting legal fees and there are no indications that Samsung Alphabet or Micron have any interest in settling with Netlist The expectations of some retail investors for court rulings in favor of the company seemed validated in April when a jury in Marshall Texas infamous because of  ruled in favor of Netlist and Samsung was ordered to pay over 303 million However a  from October 17 showed that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the California district court was incorrect in granting Netlist a summary judgment that it properly terminated a joint development and patent license agreement over memory module technologies with the Korean company and this raises expectations that Samsung could get favorable orders in similar legal battles Im also not optimistic that the lawsuits against Alphabet and Micron are going to result in a positive outcome for Netlist Overall I think that the market valuation here is likely to decrease significantly over the coming months as sentiment is turning neg,12,2023-10-25,0
114,Michael Burry's 'Big Short' On The U.S. Stock Market Is Likely Too Aggressive,I suggest that investors remain bullish on US markets While indices may trade flat to down for a period investors shouldnt forget that inflation has successfully been guided downward I dont think that a multiple in the 20x range is unreasonableHowever Dr Michael Burry the famous Big Short hedge fund manager known for accurately predicting the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis apparently disagreesThe famed investor has apparently found a new Big Short opportunity betting more than 16 billion  on a US stock market crash Interestingly  The Big Short 2015 when confronted by investors about his bet against the mortgage market Dr Burry discloses a 13 billion notional bet paying an annual premium of roughly 8090 millionNow while Dr Burry is not risking 16 billion of his equity on the latest Big Short trade a 1517 implied volatility onReflecting on Dr Burrys Big Short I believe that his bearish bet is likely too aggressive in light of the economic backdrop eg a strengthening US economy paired with a dovish Fed shift on fading inflation as well as a stillreasonable valuation for US market In fact based on historical data investors may expect positive forward returns if invested at a FWD 20x PE on the SP 500 So for me it is hard to be bearishAccording to Scion Asset managements dated 14 August Dr Burry has loaded up on put options against the US stock market As of the end of Q2 2023 Burry owned puts on 2000000 shares of the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust  which tracks the performance of the SP 500  as well as puts on 2000000 shares of the Invesco QQQ ETF  which mirrors the performance of the techfocused Nasdaq 100index Notably the notional value of these puts was 8866 million for the SPY and 7388 million for QQQ respectively adding up to 1625 millionNeedless to say Burrys aggressive short on SPY and QQQ is quite an attention grabber and with independentlythinking investor like Burry being so bearish investors should definitely take note That said however investors should also consider that Burry has already warned of a crash in early 2023 posting a Sell tweet on Twitter X  only to change his view on the stock market 3 months later when Burry withdrew his Sell recommendationOverall there should be little doubt that Dr Burrys short disclosed bet against the SPY and QQQ is of notable size However reflecting on Burrys Big Short portfolio positioning I would like to highlight a few points that render visibility on the trade clouded First investors should consider that Dr Burry is taking the trade through options which means the details of his position are in the execution most notably daystoexpiration and strike These details on the trade dominate the size of Dr Burrys capital at risk however they are not disclosed through the SEC 13F filing Second the SEC 13F filing discloses only US equity holdings Accordingly we dont know if Burry hedged his equity short with a long on treasuries for example Third and related to the second argument we dont know if Burry hedged his US equity short by going long on international equities In that context it is interesting to point out that international equities trade indeed at much  levels than US equities making an argument for a pair trade attractiveAlthough equites may indeed trade down in the next few months simply because the past rally has been so spectacular investors should consider that there are quite a few tailwinds supporting investor confidence at the moment Most notably inflation recently dropped to the 3 YoY level while the US economy continues to flash  signs of strength  see  and With a strong  economic backdrop I would like to point out that a 20x PE for the SP 500 is not unreasonable In fact based on historical data investors may on average expect positive returns if invested at the current SP 500 valuation levelWhi,273,2023-08-14,0

120,Palantir Stock: 3 Reasons To Sell Before Earnings,Palantir Technologies stock  has been on a phenomenal run this year boosted by the companys pivot towards sustainable GAAP profitability and the market mania surrounding artificial intelligenceThis runup has taken us by surprise given thatWhile sentiment seems to be exceptionally strong surrounding PLTR stock and many other artificial intelligence stocks right now we think that investors would be prudent to lock in gains ahead of next weeks earnings report We believeWith this potential upcoming negative catalyst in mind here are three reasons why we think this earnings report will be disappointingThe biggest reason to be pessimistic of PLTR going into Q2 earnings is that  while the stock price and the hype surrounding the companys artificial intelligence capabilities seems to be pointing towards rapid growth moving forward  revenues have actually been decelerating This point is largely reflective of the point we just made about management likely being unable to give the market clear guidance on how artificial intelligence will reaccelerate their revenue growth in the near futureAs the chart below illustrates since the company went public its revenue growth rate has declined every single year with particularly precipitous declines felt in 2022This dramatic deceleration of growth has prompted management to drop all talk of its original guidance for 4 billion plus in 2025 revenue Instead Wall Street analyst consensus is forecasting less than 32 billion in 2025 revenue despite still predicting that revenue growth will reaccelerate in 2024 and 2025While management is certainly making every effort to hype up its artificial intelligence credentials and capabilities it is yet to be determined just how much of a boost this will provide to growth Yes management has provided anecdotes about a spike in artificial intelligence related growth  in a recent interviewHowever it has yet to quantify what this growth looks like on the cash flow statement If artificial intelligence was truly such a powerful growth tailwind why hasnt management provided any updates on its short to medium term revenue growth outlook Perhaps this will come out on the Q2 earnings call but until they release this outlook buying PLTR stock at lofty prices based on the assumption that asofyet unquantified growth will come pouring in is a highly speculative investmentOn top of that PLTR has even  that its international business is struggling mightilyHowever while management claims that the international business  which still occupies a substantial 36 of the business  is growing at around 10 in Q1 the international commercial business shrank by 7 sequentially and the international government business saw its revenue decline by a whopping 13 sequentially With over one third of the business struggling to grow the headline revenue growth rate decelerating for several years running now management apparently abandoning previous 2025 revenue guidance and no quantifiable data being provided on what sort of growth tailwind will come from PLTRs artificial intelligence platform PLTR looks like its valuation is standing on very shaky ground heading into Q2 earningsThis likely disconnect between management hypemarket sentiment and the disappointing reality of the fundamentals was  in a recent investor note by Monness Crespi Hardts analyst Brian White who statedAnother reason to remain highly skeptical of PLTRs longterm value proposition at its current valuation is that it has struggled to develop significant economies of scale over time We do not expect Q2 to change this narrative given that their business model has not fundamentally changed and likely will not for some time if everAs the chart below illustrates PLTR has had pretty choppy EBITDA and net income margins since going public in 2020 despite its revenue more than doubling over that period and the company placing an increased emphasis on profitabilityWh,146,2023-08-04,0
121,Amazon: One Of The Best Values In The Stock Market,I just performed my annual fair value update transitioning from a 2023 to a 2024 fundamental focus and every year when I do this there are big surprisesThis update allows me to start planning ahead for the newLooking at the results the biggest surprise that I saw this year wasnt a high priority stock for meIts not the type of company that Ive been buying a lot of recentlyIt doesnt even pay a dividend and its been on a massive run throughout 2023 leading me to believe that my time and energy was better spent elsewhere examining other likely more attractive stocksBut my assumption was wrongEven after its 50 yeartodate rally which beats the pants off ofTo many that might sound crazyAmazon is this high flying tech stock with a crazy high pricetoearnings ratio rightWell yesBut that doesnt mean that the stock isnt cheapActually looking at my updated numbers for 2024 I believe that this company still has room to run higherA lot of roomMy fair value for AMZN shares right now is 21300This implies upside potential of approximately 63 from hereIn this article Ill explain why2022 was a tough year for Amazon shareholdersWhen rapidly rising interest rates took the momentum away from the techtrade AMZN shares fell from the 170 range down to its current 52week lows of 8143The companys bottomline plummeted under new CEO Andy Jassy falling from 324share in 2021 to 030share in 2022And the aggressively negative sentiment against bigtech stocks from regulators and politicians across the world continues to ramp upNone of this was good But honestly it doesnt bother meIve been sleeping well at night with a large AMZN position for years because of the companys strong growth potentialThis has never been a shortterm trade for me and I continue to like the companys longterm growth runwayCall it naive but throughout last year I always assumed that Amazon would recover thankfully 2023 has proven me rightIve bought the stock several times into its recent weakness  most recently in January of this year at 8484Right now my position is overweight and I havent considered adding shares in recent months because Ive been building out my passive income streamBut after my recent deep dive into the company AMZN is once again near the top of my shopping listThis bullishness isnt based upon blind faith Amazon has accumulated an immense amount of human capital talented leadership over the years and thats exactly what I look for when making longterm investmentsExcellence like Amazon has produced doesnt happen by accidentWith that being said I trust management when it comes to heavy spending that theyve done in recent years I believe that these investments will bolster longterm growth There arent many companies who get this sort of benefit of the doubt when it comes to a nonprofit oriented focus But without a doubt Amazon is one of themAnd Ive seen its management team flip on the profitoriented switch when necessary I suspect they could do it again  at the drop of a hat  if they really needed toFrankly Ive seen people who bet against this company get burned again and again over the yearsThats not a trap that Im willing to fall intoSo instead of trying to time the market Amazon is a simple buy and hold stock for meWhyBecause this company still stands to benefit from some of the strongest secular growth trends playing out in the world todayAmazon shares have soared Amazon is up nearly 770 during the last decade because of their prime position when it came to taking advantage of the shift from physical retail to eCommerce and the rise of cloud computingAt this point both of these trends seem like old news but the fact is theres still plenty of gas left in the tankForbes estimates that only 208 of retail sales will occur online this year They also project 108 eCommerce sales growth during 2023 overallThis low double digit growth rate is ,106,2023-09-22,0

130,Medical Properties: Strong Buy After The Dividend Cut,Shares of Medical Properties Trust  slid more than 12 on Friday after it was reported that a deal between the health care REIT and one of its tenants Prospect Medical was held up by aShares of Medical Properties crashed on Friday after a Wall Street Journal  said that the hospital REIT could run into trouble with its recapitalization deal it struck with one of its core tenants Prospect Medical in May that restructured the relationship between the tenant and the hospital landlordGiven liquidity problems for Prospect Medical Medical Properties agreed in May to take an equity position in its struggling tenant in exchange for deferred rents allowing the health care REIT potentially to later sell its equity portion in the restructured managed care business The purpose of the  was to bail out its struggling tenant which accounts for a significant revenue share and take pressure off of Prospect Medicals cash flow while also allowing Medical Properties an equity exit in the futureProspect Medical is an important tenant for MPW and it accounted for 203 of revenues in the secondquarter What has driven concerns about the WSJ report was that Medical Properties didnt disclose this fact in its Q2 earnings sheet which added to considerable selling pressure on Friday However the health care REIT made its own  on its website in response to the WSJ report and stated that the California Department of Managed Health Cares hold on the transaction is a noncontroversial part of the approval process Medical Properties also clarified that it expects to receive ultimately approval from the California state regulatorThe report from the Wall Street Journal strongly affected market sentiment and caused MPW to drop by more than 12 at some point before shares recovering towards the end of the trading day Nonetheless investors went into a fullblown panic and drove Medical Properties share price to a new 1year lowInvestors have been fearful of a dividend cut for a while which has been expressed in the REITs high dividend yield The REIT just announced that it cut its dividend to 015 pershare quarterly showing a 48 downside adjustmentIn the secondquarter earnings release the health care REIT narrowed its guidance for its FY 2023 normalized funds from operations from 150161 pershare Q1 guidance to 153157 pershare Q2 guidance The outlook itself has not been affected by the recapitalization deal and the REIT is set to easily cover its dividend with normalized funds from operations this year The new dividend payout annualized is 060 pershare and MPW is going to use the cash it freed up to reduce its leverage By redirecting cash flow to its balance sheet and to the repayment of debt Medical Properties has the potential to recover some of the losses it sustained in the last year in my opinionI am not invested in Medical Properties for reasons of securing a dividend The real upside here is in the REITs operating portfolio which investors can buy into at a ridiculously low NFFO multiplier factor at the momentShares of MPW traded at 693 on Friday and assuming the midpoint of guidance for normalized funds from operations 155 pershare shares of the REIT are valued at a ridiculous 45X NFFO So even in the case that the REIT were to lose its equity deal with Prospect Medical and was forced to work out another restructuring arrangement MPW would still be an enormously cheap bargain on a cash flow basisMedical Properties earns a significant sum of cash flowfunds from operations each quarter and with more than  as of June 30 2023 I believe all the bad news that could come out of the current restructuring deal are already priced into MPWs sharesIt is selfexplanatory that an investment in Medical Properties at this time of the restructuring has certain risks the transaction with Prospect Medical may fall through the dividend may get cut but as I said previously these concern,435,2023-10-19,0

133,Petrobras: The Best Way To Play The Oil Bull Market,Petrobras  is a controversial company but investors cant deny that this stock has performed very well since my Since then the company has recorded a strong Q2 and Brazils political and economic situation continues toI think that PBR is a fantastic longterm hold but I will say that from a technical perspective we could get a pullback in the coming monthIn this article Id like to touch on the Q2 results recent developments in Brazils economic and political situation and the oil market These are essentially the key driving factors of PBRs price which is why we must stay on top of themOverall I think the last few months have given us yet more evidence thatI maintain my buy rating due to the longterm potential and the juicy dividendPBR is a part governmentowned oil company in Brazil and though many American investors have doubts the performance speaks for itselfIn my last two articles I have talked about why I liked PBR so much so lets review this really quickly and look at what has happened since my last reportFirstly from a purely fundamental perspective PBR is much cheaper than its competitors Despite a very solid YTD performance PBR trades at a PE of 32This is well below what US oil and gas companies trade at Of course this discount can be attributed to the fact that this is a Brazilian company and this is a country which has been struggling with low growth and inflationBut where others see risk I see an opportunity As I mentioned in my the Brazilian economy has been improving and many of the risks associated with Lula may be overstatedLastly I defended that PBR would do well as oil prices increased in  and this is what we have seenPBR is up nearly 35 in the last six months and though you might think that the company is crushing it Q2 was as youd expect given the oil price at the time not that impressiveThe company reported 117 billion in required adjusted EBITDA down almost 15 from the prior quarter We can see the segment breakdown belowThe biggest fall in revenue was in the Refining Transportation and Marketing due to the 40 drop in international diesel crack spreadsMeanwhile net debt climbed for the quarter but as we can see from the panel on the right the company has a very manageable load over the next five yearsKey to my fellow incomeloving investors is the new Shareholder Remuneration Policy which was approved at the end of JulyThe company expects to pay out 45 of FCF will include equity acquisitions in the formula and may even carry out buybacks to increase shareholder returnOn the surface it looks like a decrease in the payout but it doesnt necessarily have to be once we include share buybacks This gives the company some more flexibility while also committing a high amount of their FCFInvestors in Petrobras have to also keep a close eye on the companys economy and politics This is partly a partly governmentowned monopoly which does create a potential riskWith that said since Lulas appointment the company has done well and despite a lot of speculation on the matter the president has not derailed this companys trajectory If anything we have seen the oppositeIn the last few months we have seen a string of bullish news for the company Just a couple of weeks ago Brazils attorney general opened up the possibility of Some might find this unexpected coming from Lulas government and the President did address this apparent contradiction in an interviewSource This actually makes sense dare I say Brazils economy has been lagging for some time and the president doesnt want to cripple it especially now that it is doing relatively wellBrazil has been  growing GDP 34 YoY and with unemployment falling below 8 which is good for the countryAnd to top things off following a very aggressive hiking cycle the Brazilian Central Bank has now begun to cut aggressively starting with a 5Of course the fate of PBR will depend,502,2023-10-25,0

136,STK: Market Pressures Bring Down Premium For This Hot Tech Fund,Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund  has been having a solid year of performance in rebounding after it faced the 2022 techdriven selloff The funds share price started to getThis provides a more attractive entry level for the fund but patient investors may wait for a discount to appear Thats why it remains a Hold today We last touched on  and I felt like it was a hold at that time too due to the premium It coincidentally traded around the same premium as it does now A discount doesnt happen often but it has happened historically The fund is worth revisiting today for those who are already holding aSTKs  is to target longterm capital appreciation and current income To achieve this they will invest in a portfolio of technology stocks while also incorporating an option overlay strategy designed to mitigate downside volatility and generate incomeThe funds options writing strategy generally focuses on writing calls against the NASDAQ 100 Index or its ETF equivalent at a 25 to 90 overwrite This flexibility allows them to be more or less defensive given the environmentThat being said it is a  and not an entirely actively managed part of their strategy as is the case with some of their peers The options strategy allocation involves where the CBOE NASDAQ100 Volatility Index is trading Higher volatility means theyll get more defensive and lower volatility means a lower sleeve will be overwrittenAdditionally in their last semiannual report it looks like they had also been writing covered calls This was to a much small extentSome appropriate comparisons could be the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust  Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund  and Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund  These are funds that are mostly tilted towards largercap holdings and also implement a callwriting options strategy to generate premiums and dampen volatility a touchAs tech has been recovering meaningfully this year all of these funds have been enjoying some strong gains STK is the secondbest performing on a total NAV return basis YTDNBXG launched in mid2021 so if we drop that fund we can look at a comparison over the longer term In this case STK has come out ahead as it took over the lead from BST BST performed exceptionally well coming out of 2020 as they shifted more towards speculative growth names and shifted a bit away from the largecap focus That eventually came back to bite them as those are the exact names that took the heaviest hits through 2022 In this case both STK and BST had beaten out QQQX by a significant marginMy main point to bring up the difference in performance here isnt that STK is going to keep winning going forward but to make a point that diversification matters Even within the tech space with comparable funds they arent necessarily going to perform exactly the same There will be overlap but as the performance shows us they arent going to be exactly the same We dont know which fund will perform best in any given period so taking a more diversified approach can be beneficialFor an investor who is looking to outperform the market or whatever benchmark they are chasing that often means diversification isnt a good thing to have as it leads to reasonable returns but not outperformance However you probably wouldnt be looking at callwriting funds in the first place so these are certainly more geared toward income investors who might want a little side of growth potentialThis can be highlighted in the longer term where on an annualized basis STK has provided lower returns than its noncallwriting benchmark When a fund is writing calls it can cap the upside potential in a strong bull market Of course portfolio positioning will have played a role in this outcome as well as having an expense ratio These were still fairly solid returns if compared to the broader market This is through the period ending June 3,494,2023-10-27,0

141,"Medical Properties Trust: Downgraded After Dividend Reduction, I'm No Longer Bullish",Its been an awful year for Medical Properties Trust  and its shareholders Over the past year shares have declined by 5677 and since earnings on 8823 shares have lost roughly 13 of theirIn less than 2 weeks shares of MPW have lost roughly 13 of their previous value and an onslaught of negative news and downgrades have impacted sentiment  slashed its rating to underperform from strong buy and cited similar frustrations as I did Next   downgraded MPW to underperform from neutral  was the next large firm to lower its price target on MPW from 12 to 10 and add a speculative risk qualifier to its outperform rating Just the other day on 821   downgraded MPW to underweight from neutral as its the latest firm to revise its outlook on the medical property REITIf the downgrades werent enough The  published an article discussing how a California regulator has halted a deal to provide financial support to one of MPWs struggling tenants In addition to the article  slashed its quarterly dividend from 029 to 015 These factors have weighed heavy on the market sentiment toward MPW after a disappointing quarter where Medical Properties Trust tightened its guidance as they now see 2023 normalized FFO coming in between 1253  157 compared to 150 to 161 did respond to the article from The Wall Street Journal and indicated the following thingsWhat happens with the California regulators remains to be seen What is reflected in the current share price is a slashed dividend many downgrades and uncertainty with the Prospect approval None of this is good and while I want to be optimistic the reality is that sentiment for MPW has been decimatedIn Q2  net loss was 42 million or 007 per diluted share compared to generating 190 million in net income in Q2 of 2022 MPW had previously disclosed that there would be286 million in accelerated lease intangible amortization related to the early termination of Stewards leases of five  hospitals now leased to CommonSpirit and a related 95 million straightline rent writeoff partially offset by a roughly 160 million tax benefit related to the Companys establishment of a  MPW narrowed its 2023 net income per share to a range of 033 to 037 and its NAREIT Funds From Operations NFFO to 153 to 157 to account for the Q2 loss from Raymond James asked if the board has considered a dividend cut to retain more capital to strengthen the balance sheet Steve Hammer MPW CFO indicates that every option is on the table and is at a board level My issue with this is while the statement clearly indicated that a dividend cut could occur they didnt announce it on the conference call Analysts from BOA KeyBanc Capital Barclays Mizuho JPM Wells Fargo  and Raymond James were on the call As a shareholder I would have rather seen management make the announcement outline the plan in detail then engage with the analysts rather than wait I find it hard to believe that the decision wasnt already made in time for the conference call From an optics and damage control aspect I feel it would have been beneficial to unveil a plan to drive value for shareholders by cutting the dividend when the analysts were there Maybe the narrative would have been that management is making the tough decisions but theyre the right decisions for the future of the company since the analysts would have had the ability to ask questionsAfter the first 6 months of operations MPWs total debt and liabilities have slightly decreased There was 1024 billion in debt and 1089 billion in total liabilities on the balance sheet The severity of having 1024 billion in debt on the balance sheet depends on profitability the actual debt profile the value of the companys assets and the ability to paybackservice the debtI went into the  and looked at the debt profile which is below MPW has 5761 of its debt maturing between 2025  2027 with 50812 million coming due in ,383,2023-10-28,0

146,Tsakos Energy Navigation: Low Valuation With Significant Upside Potential,Tsakos Energy Navigation is a shipowner focused on the crude and product tanker markets but with some limited exposure to LNG carriers they own three LNGCs and to shuttle tankers The companys balance sheet was in a rickety position before the recent upturn but strength in tanker rates from early2022 onwards has allowed the company to materially improve its financial positionShareholder returns have been substantially weaker than those of peers it is difficult to compete against DHTs 100 and EURNs 80 payouts of net income or FROs and OETs generous distributions which has disappointed investors Furthermore some questionable capital allocation decisions were made exemplified byTNP owns a fleet of 58 onthewater vessels along with ten vessels on order The company is mostly focused on the Suezmax and Aframax sectors with 18 and 19 vessels in each of those subsectors respectively including a few shuttle tankers plus two additional LR2s Suezmax and Aframax rates have been exceptionally strong since the Russian invasion of Ukraine but have suffered over the past few months as Urals oil traded above the price cap displacing the sanctionscompliant fleet from the trade and Russia curtailed its exportsThe company follows a balanced approach employing some vessels on the spot market and others on fixed and variable charters which is a differentiated strategy from most peers in the sector which tend to employ their vessels virtually 100 on spot This allowed the company to survive the downturn despite their levered balance sheet but has weighed on potential returns once the market turned upward since Tsakos still has several vessels earning wellbelow market rates On the other hand the charter coverage provides downside protection if rates would happen to notably weaken in the near to mediumtermTNPs current fleet employment can be seen in their  which was updated on August 30 The company has done a good job rolling legacy contracts at higher rates whereas they have also done some blendandextend deals For example TNP recently disclosed it had agreed to fix the Neo Energy a 2007built LNG carrier at 1155kday until February 2024 the charterer also has a oneyear extension option at 100kday Annualizing the increased contribution from the steamer relative to the previous 37kday contract equates to 096sh in annual EPS from this single ship alone illustrating the companys substantial operating leverage Additionally they also have a modern LNG carrier on a variable hire contract with a floor of 50kday and a cap at 145kday LNGC rates have increased materially over the past couple of months so the contribution from this vessel should also improve materially throughout the second half of the yearOf the 10 vessels on order six are already fixed on medium to longterm contracts including the four dualfuel Aframaxes and the two shuttle tankers whereas the two Suezmaxes with delivery in 2025 and the two recently ordered MR2s remain unchartered Considering current newbuild pricing I believe it makes sense to secure charter cover to derisk the investments although that is obviously contingent on the deals potentially availableOverall TNP has by far the highest operating leverage in the tanker sector but that has partly gone unnoticed given their substantial charter cover part of it remains at below market rates However if market balances remain tight TNP will continue to roll its exposure going forward leading to higher EPS and FCF helping illustrate their true earnings potentialLooking ahead I expect TNP to also divest the older portion of the fleet they own four 20052006 built Suezmaxes that look like prime disposal candidates as well as two 2007built Aframaxes two 2006built LR2s the Handysizes all built in 2007 and a 2003built Panamax I do not expect the disposal of this older tonnage in one fell swoop but for TNP to pursue a more gradua,41,2023-09-01,0
147,PepsiCo: Recession Fears? Now May Be The Time To Buy This Dividend King,PepsiCo  Pepsi is one of the most wellknown brands globally Ive actually been around the company my whole life My mother was and still is a huge Pepsi drinker I asked her why she preferred Pepsi over CocaCola I understand its hard seeing your stocks fall or your portfolio in the red for days or even months at a time As most of us know theres a lot of uncertainty going on right now Recession talks high interest rates surging oil prices etc When everything seems to be going great in the economy thats when stocks normally trade at very high premiums And right now there doesnt seem to be much positive sentiment surrounding the stock market But that uncertainty allows the best opportunities to present themselves to buy highquality stocks like PEP at discountsOne reason I believe the price has fallen recently is treasury rates Before the recent price pullback the stock was grossly overvalued in my opinion as investors were looking for safe places to park their money As you can see below bonds have surged in the last 6 months This has impacted investor sentiment and outlook on the market as a whole Why invest money into a stock that yields less than 3 when I can get almost 6 riskfree Thats a fair and valid question There are several elements that go into investing in the stock market Time horizons age how much capital one has type of investing investment goals etc all play an important roleSo investors have had to deal with not only rising interest rates but more and more talks of a recession which is speculated to occur in 2024 Hearing all this negative sentiment is hard as an investor because no one wants to lose money I actually mentioned a recession in one of my earlier articles and a reader commented that recession talks were debunked Im not so sure hes saying that nowAs analysts here on Seeking Alpha we dont have all the answers nor can we predict where prices will go All we can do is give our opinion with the knowledge  research we have done and give that to our readers Ill be the first to admit I find myself asking the same questions Did I miss something Was my research thorough enough I often go back and doublecheck Whatever you have to do to remind yourself I say do it For me I often go back and look at Warren Buffetts videos I was actually listening to one recentlyOne I watched stood out to me and I think is relevant with a recession loomingI think this is very important for my readers to think about Im sure some may have already heard this But sometimes we need a reminder especially when times are toughThe GFC lasted a total period of 18 months from December 2007 to June 2009 During that time the stock fell 31 Another quote from Buffett that stands out to me and I think it bodes well currentlyWell we see below what PEP has done since then The price has appreciated nearly 200 from a price of 5496 on June 30th the month the recession was declared over in 2009 Back in 2008 I was just starting to get my feet wet investing One of my superiors used to mention it and I would always ask questions about what companies I should invest in I was a young sailor back then so I had no clue what I was doing I was just looking to place my money into the stock market hoping to get a positive return I looked at it like the lottery and would log on to my brokerage account to check the balance multiple times every day Whenever it was green I was excited Whenever it was red I would get anxious and start questioning myself This caused me to sell a lot of great companies such as KO and miss out on great returns in the processMost of us know PEP has more than a half of century of dividend growth and is a dividend king The company actually raised its dividend during the last recession by 25 from 030 to 03750 And have continued raising it uninterrupted to the current dividend of 12650 PEP raised the dividend by 10 earlier this ,12,2023-10-24,0

167,When The Bough Breaks,Valueconscious historicallyinformed fullcycle investors place a great deal of emphasis on the relationship between the price an investor pays today and the cash flows they can expect to receive in the future The reason is simple For any given stream of future cash flows the higher the price you pay today the lower the longterm return you can expect and the greater your downside risk The lower the price you pay today the greater the longterm return you can expect and the smaller your downside riskIt seems counterintuitive but its true  lower expected market returns go handinhand with higher risk of loss higher expected market returns go handinhand with lower risk of loss That proposition seems to run counter to whats taught in finance but speaking as a former finance professor thats because the concept of inefficient risk isnt discussed carefully enough As I wrote in  at the January 2022 market peakInvestors are familiar with the idea of a tradeoff between return and risk which is typically stated as a proposition that investors must accept higher risk if they seek higher expected returns What investors are typically not taught is that this proposition applies only to efficient risks For example if a portfolio is poorly diversified one can typically find another portfolio that can target a higher level of expected return for the same amount of risk or a lower level of risk for the same expected return Likewise in a wildly overvalued market investors should expect not only poor returns but also higher prospective risk Put simply investors are not somehow rewarded for accepting higher levels of what Ben Graham described as unintelligent riskThe relationship between valuations and subsequent market returns tends to be fairly tight even over horizons on the order of 1012 years but its not perfect particularly if the end of that 1012year investment horizon happens to be the valuation extreme of a bubbleTo update the current valuation picture for stocks the chart below shows the relationship between our most reliable valuation measure the ratio of nonfinancial market capitalization to nonfinancial corporate gross valueadded including estimated foreign revenues MarketCapGVA and actual subsequent 12year average annual SP 500 total returns in data since 1928Bubble extremes lead investors to forget history Investors look back on the advance of the preceding years and see only that high valuations were followed by even higher valuations that every setback was followed by a resumption of glorious returns They conclude that valuations are worthless They imagine that the returns they enjoyed from the point of rich valuations to the point of extreme valuations are actually returns that they will keep over the complete cycle Worse like economist Irving Fisher catastrophically proposed in 1929 many investors insist that market cycles no longer exist and that valuations will maintain a permanently high plateauBuckle upThe red line in the chart below shows our MarginAdjusted PE MAPE which is not quite as reliable as MarketCapGVA but outperforms the Shiller cyclicallyadjusted PE CAPE in market cycles across history  the blue line is based on  SP 500 dividends across history Each point is obtained by taking the actual index dividends of the SP 500 from that point forward and discounting them to present value at a fixed 10 rate of return Its worth noting that per share index earnings revenues and dividends for the SP 500 include the impact of stock buybacks through adjustments in the divisor Over the past 20 years the SP 500 divisor has contracted at an average annual rate of 050 adding half of one percent to the annual growth rate of pershare SP 500 fundamentals Given that SP 500 revenue growth for the 10 20 and 30 years through 2020 averaged just 4 annually and current SP 500 dividends arent at all depressed relative to reve,12,2023-10-17,0
168,"Why BSTZ, BMEZ, And BIGZ Distribution Cuts Aren't A Big Deal",    and   have announced a change to their distribution policy which willFrom the Previously like most other BlackRock CEFs these three funds paid level distributions that would be reset infrequently based on market conditions or expectations However going forward BSTZ BMEZ and BIGZ will instead pay a variable monthly distribution at a 6 rate based on the past 12month rolling average daily NAV Given that BSTZ BMEZ and BIGZ had paid NAV yields of over 9 this change will effectively result in a significant cut when the new policy is implementedIs the new distribution policy good or bad Actually I dont think it has a very large effect either wayFirst lets remember that equity CEFs generally make use of capital gains and return of capital to fund their distributions see  When the stock prices of the companies in the CEFs portfolios are rising the funds can afford to pay out more distributions In fact BSTZ had actually increased its monthly distribution three times since inception from 0100month to 0192month in just over two years as growth stocks soared over the pandemicOn the other hand in a declining market the distributions will eventually have to be reduced to a more sustainable level in order to prevent the NAV from eroding too much Whether this happens monthly with small decreases or infrequently with larger cuts doesnt matter all that muchSecondly it should be remembered that return of capital is simply an accounting term see  While ideally we wouldnt want to see an overly high distribution resulting in an erosion of NAV socalled destructive ROC it should be remembered that any distribution regardless of its classification deducts from the NAVThis is why I always encourage our members to not just focus on the yield Ultimately it is the funds portfolios that drive the total return not the percentage yield of the CEF or the tax character of the distributionsMoreover remember that any distribution regardless of its classification should be included in calculating the total return With many CEFs their share prices and distributions may have been declining over time due to an overly optimistic payout policy However if you include the effect of compound distributions you would still get a very respectable total returnHere is a simple illustration Eaton Vance TaxManaged Global BuyWrite Opportunities Fund  has lost over half its NAV since inception in September 2005 with distributions declining by 612 but its total return on NAV is still a respectable 1658 when distributions are includedThis is why the critiques that ROC is just getting your own money back are rather misplaced though it is an understandable sentiment Remember that as a shareholder all of the CEFs assets are your money No matter whether the distributions are coming from earnings realized gains or capital its still your money coming back to youRather the premiumdiscount valuation is more important in terms of thinking about generating alpha from CEFs Consider the extreme case if a fund is at a discount Id be very happy to get all my money back in a single liquidating distribution This means that youd be paying 90 cents to get a 1 backFinally with the benefit of hindsight timing was everything BSTZ was the best performing CEF in all of 2020 and BMEZ also soundly thumped BME Remember the Z funds have a much greater allocation to more speculative companies including private firms which were bid up to excessive levels during the growth stock mania that reached its peak in early 2021Unfortunately those who added or bought these funds at their high points would have seen major losses as the growthinnovative companies crashed However on a total return basis we may have simply come back full circle Since inception on BMEZ on January 29 2020 BST 2752 only slightly leads BSTZ 2572 Although the difference between BME 2504 and BM,29,2023-10-04,0
169,GDXJ: Junior Miners Could Outperform In The Next Rally Higher For Gold,The VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF  has likely disappointed a lot of investors in recent years with the fund losing nearly half its value from a high in 2020 Even as the underlying price of gold currently tradingThat being said we believe this segment of the market deserves a closer look amid some renewed bullish momentum in the price of gold There are several moving parts here but we believe the junior mining stocks within the GDXJ fund are wellpositioned to outperform the price of gold going forwardGLDXJ technically tracks the MVIS Gold Junior Miners Index According to theAcross the universe of eligible stocks the bottom 40 of the sector in terms of market capitalization are covered as representing the junior miners or smallcaps of the broader sector There is also a minimum 150 million market value threshold and trading liquidity criteriaThe idea with gold mining stocks is that their income potential and implied market value can climb beyond the corresponding impact of an increase in the price of gold to sales This concept known as operating leverage is applied to all companies but is particularly relevant to commodity producersThe attraction of GDXJ is that the portfolio of smallcap names has a higher beta than the gold market meaning they are more sensitive to changes in the price of gold Simply put with a bullish view of gold and the expectation that the metal price can rally by 25 over the next year wed expect junior mining stocks to rally by multiples of thatSo while its difficult to predict exactly how high GDXJ could climb in a scenario where the price of gold reaches 2500oz for example our bet is that it would beat out its lower beta largecap alternativesIn terms of current holdings Kinross Gold Corp  with a market value of 65 billion is the largest holding in GDXJ representing 7 of the fund Here while the company is technically a midcap but within the cutoff for index inclusion Pan American Silver Corp  with a 7 weighting produces a significant amount of silver but falls within the gold junior miners themeThe bigger point here is that GDXJ is wellrepresented by major corporations that in many cases include  in terms of ore grades and mining yields The portfolio of 99 stocks also has a good diversification globally including several international stocks that are not otherwise traded on a US exchangeHere we can make a distinction between GDXJ and the VanEck Gold Miners ETF  which essentially holds all the bigger gold stocks that arent excluded from GDXJNaturally there are some advantages to that largecap strategy considering top holdings in names like Newmont Corp  and Barrick Gold Corp  are recognized as sector leaders with overall strong fundamentalsThese types of gold mining bellwethers typically have globally diversified operations that add a layer of quality to cash flows which minimizes risk That dynamic has translated into lower volatility for GDX historically including generating a modest positive gain yeartodate up 3 compared to a modest 3 decline from GDXJOn the other hand one weakness of the GDX ETF is the portfolio concentration with just the top 10 holdings representing 61 of the overall fund GDXJ offers a more extensive portfolio with 99 stocks that are a bit more balanced in terms of exposure to each underlying nameThat unique profile includes some of the more speculative exploitation and development stage comings down the line stand to benefit the most from a major move higher in the price of gold leading to a structural repricing higherThats what played out during the early pandemic for gold where prices climbed from a low of 1451oz in March of that year to 2028oz by August In this case GDXJ returned 160 which was well above the 117 gain in GDX and the 37 rally in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF  over the same periodThe most bullish case for GDXJ would envision a repeat of a similar outperformance in the next,11,2023-10-19,0

176,Gulf Island Fabrication Is My Top Value Pick In A Choppy Market,Gulf Island Fabrication  is the largest position in my portfolio and my highestconviction value investment The company has everything I look for in a value name assets that provide downside protection a clear path to improved earnings andGIFI is a steel fabricator and specialty services provider to the industrial and energy industries The companys operations areGIFIs situation has steadily improved since 2019 when a new CEO joined the company Richard Heo had once been a customer of GIFI in a previous role  and accepted the job as CEO to try and return the company to its fabrication roots Since joining the company Heo has sold off the shipyard divisions backlog and assets returned bidding disciple to the fabrication division and made a successful acquisition in the services spaceThere have been two major developments since my last article about GIFI First GIFI announced the signing of a major fabrication contract worth 100mm in September of 2022  By the time GIFI announced FY 2022 results in March the customer had put the project and hold and the contract was formally canceled in Q2 of this year GIFI has been paid for the work performed on the project but it is a meaningful setback towards fully utilizing the fabrication facilities Management is actively bidding on other projects and is confident that they can replace the lost work Second GIFI announced on Oct 8th that they settled the ongoing litigation between themselves and Hornbeck Offshore Services  Hornbeck was a shipyard customer who terminated a contract back in 2018 due to complaints about the quality of GIFIs work and significant project delays Hornbeck had demanded the ships be delivered midconstruction refused to pay the outstanding balance due to GIFI for work already performed and demanded compensation for financial damages incurred by the delays A trial date was set for later this month but GIFI decided to settle ahead of the trial The end result is that GIFI agreed to forfeit the remaining contract receivables 13mm and to pay performance bond company Zurich American Insurance 20mm and 3 annual interest over 15 years to make Hornbeck whole This is not the outcome I was hoping for as a GIFI investor but the silver lining is that the matter is now resolved and a large cloud of uncertainty has been lifted off of the company Despite the negative outcome the market was generally pleased to have the matter resolved GIFI shares are up 13 since the settlement was announcedThe foundation of a good value investment in my opinion is downside protection GIFI provides investors downside protection via its robust balance sheet At the end of Q2 GIFI had total assets of 136mm including 40mm of cash and shortterm investments against total liabilities of just 32mm Postsettlement GIFIs assets have decreased by 13mm due to writtenoff contract receivables and its liabilities have increased by 2029mm 20mm does not include the 3 annual interest 29mm is the total amount due to Zurich over the next 15 years Im not sure if GIFI will treat the liability like debt and only include the 20mm or if they will list the entire 29mm as an other noncurrent liability GIFIs book value is between 350share and 4share after adjusting for the settlement and taking out goodwill and intangible assets At the time of this writing GIFI is trading at 371 so net assets provide nearly 100 downside protectionGIFIs cash pile is robust and cash burn has been minimal so far in 2023 I expect them to be cash flow positive over the remainder of the year but in a hypothetical liquidation event I think GIFI investors would be well protected The companys PPE at cost comes in at about 125mm against accumulated depreciation of about 100mm GIFIs fabrication facilities and equipment have been underutilized for nearly a decade and I suspect their deprecation schedule has been overly aggressive as a result Buildin,9,2023-10-10,0
177,Hedge Funds Are Shorting Treasuries En Masse,2year treasuries are currently quoted with 49 yield to maturity YTM while the 10year treasuries promise to reward investors with 396 respectively Needless to say these YTMs can be considered as highly attractive especially reflecting on the 1 yield environment seen from early 2020 through late 2021With that frame of reference I have recently  that it is time for investors to rotate out of  stocks and into riskless fixed income securities such as US government bondsHedge funds however appear to strongly disagree with this thesis In fact according to the COT report leveraged money has accumulated the biggest short position in 10year treasury futures since almost a decadeBefore I present the latest data let me quickly give an explanation about the data source The COT is an acronym for Commitments of Traders a weekly publication released by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC that provides valuable insights into the positions of different market participants in various futures marketsThe report is based on data collected from futures traders including commercial traders often producers or consumers of the underlying commodity noncommercial traders typically large speculators such as hedge funds and nonreportable traders smaller traders who do not meet the reporting threshold That said the report is primarily used to track the positioning of noncommercial traders such as hedge funds as they often take speculative positions based on market trends and expectationsWith that frame of reference we are ready to look at the data Firstly investors should note the  for the 2year treasuries futures highlighting that leveraged money incl Hedge Funds see green line has shorted close to 1500000 contracts accumulating the biggest short position since 2019Secondly I would like to point investors attention to the 10year treasuries futures where Hedge Funds  close to 1500000 contracts Although the short position in longdated treasuries has started to revert back a bit the negative positioning of leveraged money is still the most extreme reading recorded in the past decadeAccording to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou the cumulative short bet of leveraged money is estimated at a 150 billion notional short exposureBut why are Hedge Funds shorting so aggressively I see three possible explanations1 Interest Rate Expectations Hedge funds may anticipate a rise in interest rates Because when traders investors expect interest rates to increase they take short positions in treasuries to benefit from falling bond prices As interest rates rise existing bonds with lower yields become less attractive leading to a decline in their market valuePersonally I dont think that Hedge Funds are betting on rising rates after the aggressive hiking campaign of the FED has already materialized And after the core inflation has recently  to below 3 YoY growth in June2 YieldCurve Strategies Hedge funds may implement yieldcurve strategies which involve taking positions based on expectations of changes in the yield curves shapeIf Hedge Funds would execute on YieldCurve Strategies then the COT report would likely show a discrepancy of how Hedge Funds view short vs longdated securities eg if traders would bet on a yield curve contango meaning longdated yields are higher than shortdated ones investors would buy the 2year and sell the 10year As the COT report shows however leveraged money is short on both ends of the curve3 Relative Value Trades Hedge funds engage in relative value trading strategies where they identify discrepancies in bond prices and exploit opportunities for profit They might short treasuries while simultaneously taking long positions in other assets seeking to profit from price differentialsWith both explanation 1 and 2 unlikely the Relative Value Trade is left to explain why Hedge Funds are shorting trea,19,2023-10-11,0
178,Atlantica Sustainable: Combine Its 8.6% Yield With Covered Calls For A ~15% Annualized Income Yield,Shares of Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure  have declined by about 315 over the past year resulting in the stocks yield climbing to a nearalltime high of 86While this in itself is likely to classify Atlantica as a compelling pickSpecifically I believe that combining a shareholding in Atlantica with selling covered calls should allow investors to realize an annualized income yield close to 15 all while improving their margin of safetyIn this article I willLets goAtlanticas core operational strategy revolves around the ownership and proficient management of an extensive renewable energy portfolioBased on its most  Atlanticas portfolio contains 44  collectively boasting a capacity to generate 2161 megawatts of clean energy Within this expansive portfolio 31 projects are dedicated to solar and wind farms while seven focus on the crucial domains of transmission and transportation Additionally three projects are committed to optimizing natural gas utilization with another three revolving around waterrelated initiativesWhat truly sets Atlantica apart is not just the breadth of its asset base across a spectrum of project types but also its extensive global footprint While a substantial portion of its revenue stream  stems from North America the companys cash flows are far from sourced by a singular region Europe and South America contribute 34 and 18 respectively to its cash flow mix while the remaining 8 is dispersed across the globe with significant contributions from countries such as South Africa and AlgeriaThe company primarily serves a customer base comprised of either private or governmentowned electrical utilities typically engaging in longterm Purchase Power Agreements PPAs Moreover Atlantica also leverages longterm concession contracts resulting in its assets currently enjoying an average remaining contract term of approximately 14 yearsFinally 92 of Atlanticas interest rates in project debt are fixed or hedged  a major advantage during a risingrates environmentHaving declined by roughly 315 over the past shares of Atlantica have underperformed the overall market significantly during this period But what is actually keeping Atlanticas stock under pressureThe answer can be broken down into two primary factorsThe first factor contributing to the decline in Atlanticas stock price can be attributed to a shift in investor sentiment In simple terms the stocks cost of equity has increased significantly following the shift to a rather shaky macro landscapeFor context in 2021 during the excitement running through equities induced by the pandemic investors were drawn to Atlantica for its yield However as interest rates began to climb investors started offloading their holdings in Atlantica They did this in response to the heightened risk associated with equities and the necessity for a higher return from a yieldcoParticularly in 2021 Atlanticas dividend had declined to as low as 359 Given the gradual increase in the Federal Funds Rate which currently stands between 525 and 550 it is understandable that investors have been gradually demanding a higher yield from AtlanticaThis demand stems from their need to be adequately compensated for the added risk associated with holding this stock This explains the gradual decline in the stocks value during the ongoing period of interest rate hikes and why the market has now pushed the stocks yield up to 86The second factor contributing to the decline in Atlanticas stock price can be attributed to growing speculation over Algonquin Power  Utilities selling their equity state in the company The Canadian company is Atlanticas major owner holding about 42 of its sharesIn Jueduce debt and improve earnings This comes after AQN amassed significant debt  following completing a series of acquisitions in previous years With rates on the rise its no wonder AQN needs to deleverage its overbu,47,2023-08-01,0
