1,BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,How does BHP Group Limited  one of the largest diversified mining companies globally fit into an energy investment thesisDespite the exceptional 20212022 runup energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities  particularly among stocks withThat in a nutshell is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too However I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand Perhaps emerging economies like India INDA manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs  or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughsI personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities For example cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an environmentally conscious voter base In either case for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even netzero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this This naturally points to the mining industry as a hedge if oil gets phased out faster  and within mining BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resourcesBHPs mining portfolio has shifted over the years but after the  to Woodside  currently the group focuses on the If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker it has to consume a lot more of BHPs products at least in the next few decades to build out the new infrastructure that would support a lowcarbon economy Mining itself is very energy intensive so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels but lets assume thats only a shortterm effect and in the longrun net fossil fuel use will still dropBHP is certainly not the only miner out there but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand outBHPs yeartodate return is a negative 72 but lets be clear  the only reason for this years underperformance are fears over Chinas economy Yet the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors China sentiment may have bottomed The markets are also forward looking so commodity futures and BHPs stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving As much as China remains the main risk the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higherThe short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything The Tesla  in your garage only substitutes one type of nonrenewable resource for a different one Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply To the IEAs credit their  entitled Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions tried to quantify these exact megatrendsThe IEA distinguishes between a stated policies scenario STEPS associated with a slower energy transition and a sustainable development scenario or SDS which implies even faster decarbonization The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels by resource typeCopper demand of relevance to BHP is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x depending on how quickly the energy transition moves In 2020 the world,33,2023-10-08,6
2,Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at 595B This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang the market didnt seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes transaction costs or asymmetric information about managements intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the companys future investment opportunities For example one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musks company isnt known for paying dividends but the market rightly or wrongly puts a very high value on its investment opportunitiesThe Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified Investors pay taxes and transaction costs a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining managements ability to invest in negative present value projects Last but not least many individual and institutional investors simply need current income You could theoretically generate income from a nondividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costsIn practice companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities  You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of managements confidence in the stability of the business Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isnt obliged to maintain them in bad yearsImportantly a very high dividend  or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage  doesnt by itself make for a good dividend stock If anything leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project The dividend may also be at risk of being cut ie the stock may be a dividend trapAt the end of the day oil  gas is a cyclical industry and producers cant control the price of their output For this reason large US independents like Marathon Oil  APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividendsExxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays but its still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staplesIt depends on your time horizon Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter  Gamble However a nice  dividend growth series doesnt mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from 250 to 250 The financial leverage also tends to yoyo a bitUnsurprisingly the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if youre a buyandhold investor though I would say yes Even if you never sell any stocks you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever To illustrate this point I ran a backtest that assumes you started with 1000 in January 2001 and invested another 1000 each month thereafter all the way through September 2023 I compared Exxon to PG as a typical consumer staples company and to Devon  as a more risky upstream player I assume,43,2023-10-15,8

4,Baytex Energy Offers Big Upside And A Growing Dividend But Beware Of The Risks,  isnt an obvious energy income investment It currently pays a 009 per share dividend on its stock which generates a 16 yield Thats not even inAt the moment BTE shares dont reflect this possibility so investors seeking income generated from higher oil prices could consider buying them now in anticipation of a higher dividendIn recent weeks BTE transitioned to paying out 50 of its free cash flow for debt repayment and 50 in a mix of dividends and share repurchases We estimate that at current oil prices BTE generates a 30 free cash flowAt oil prices above US80 per barrel WTI  we expect BTE to pay out 025 per share annually as a dividend which would generate a 45 yield on the current share price As the remaining free cash flow is used to repurchase shares the number of shares outstanding will decline over time and free cash flow per share will increase Consequently BTEs capacity to pay dividends on a pershare basis can grow as long as WTI remains above US80 per barrel and BTE shares remain undervalued by the marketFrom a capital appreciation standpoint BTE shares offer multibagger potential due to the huge amount of free cash flow generated at higher oil prices Our price target for the shares is 950 representing a 73 upside from the current priceThe challenge in analyzing the investment merits of BTE equity lies in the companys Eagle Ford assets The longterm economics of depleting shale assets is receiving more attention and investors have to be comfortable with the prospects for BTEs shale acreage to continue generating free cash flow Particular attention must be paid to the longevity of the assets reserves and the sustainability of their current production mix We address both issues in this articleBTE is a Canadiandomiciled oilandgas EP that derives half its revenues from several oilrich basins in Alberta and Saskatchewan and half from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas Its assets are shown in the BTE shares have been well known among Canadian oil investors for the companys tremendous cash flow torque to higher oil prices As oil prices increase its cash flows grow more rapidly than most of its peers Of course the flip side is that as oil prices decline BTEs cash flow falls more rapidlyOn February 28 BTE  it would acquire Ranger Oil for C34 billion US25 billion In the deal BTE paid Ranger shareholders 749 BTE shares plus US1331 in cash for each Ranger share which represented a premium of 74 to Rangers closing stock price the previous day BTE also assumed Rangers debtTo finance the deal BTE paid 7328 million in cash and issued 3114 million new BTE shares valued at 13 billion or 426 per share The newly issued shares increased BTEs share count by 54 It funded the cash portion through borrowings on its credit facility a twoyear term loan and the issuance of 800 million senior secured notes due 2030 The deal closed on June 20 2023The deal was transformative to BTE After it closed the companys Eagle Ford acreage was comprised of two largely contiguous blocks allowing for optimal development and lower costs per barrel  shows that its acreage is located primarily in the oily part of the Eagle Ford play depicted in greenThe deal has clear benefits for BTE shareholders It modestly extends the companys provedplusprobable reserve life for oil natural gas and NLGs by approximately one year to 12 years It also boosts the oil weighting of BTEs Eagle Ford productionThe before and after pro forma metrics for BTEs Eagle Ford acreage are shown belowImportantly the acquisition increases the percentage of Eagle Ford production that BTE operates With greater control over its Eagle Ford operations management can drill at its own pace and work to improve drilling techniques Weve heard an unsubstantiatedthough we believe credibleclaim that BTEs management believes it can improve the productivity of the legacy Ranger a,51,2023-10-05,6
5,180 Degree Of Separation From The Investment Hoard,   Our Graham  Dodd approach allows us to identify undervalued companies whose stocks we believe provide the opportunity for 100 appreciation over a onetothreeyear cycle Focusing on microcaps means we are participating in a market where there are significantly fewer sophisticated investors which we believe means there are more opportunities for us to unearth than would otherwise be available amongst larger market capitalization companies We also believe that being concentrated allows our investors to have the potential to achieve higher returns if we get our stock picking right than could be generated from diversified funds Of course the converse is possible if our stock selections do not perform as we believe they can and their stocks decline in value This risk is why we first ask ourselves How much do we believe we can lose on each investment so that we manage risks appropriately We are not afraid to walk away from an investment at a loss if the investment thesis is no longer applicableAnd lastly by being constructive activists we think and act as engaged owners like principals in a handson working relationship with managements which is unlike most traditional passive institutional investors We are able to work hand in hand with our portfolio companies in order to unlock the value that we believe we have identified through our analysis We apply a number of traditional value investor screens to the publicly traded microcap market All of the other pieces of our investment approach in particular our concentration and constructive activism are predicated on first identifying companies that we believe are undervalued relative to other comparable companies in the marketplace as well as undervalued relative to that companys longerterm earnings powerThis initial screening is followed by a deep dive into their management the strength of their current and prospective business and a rigorous analysis of their financial statements If this analysis yields a catalyst that we are able to identify and that we believe should it occur will lead to a sharp increase of the stock price of a target company then we will initiate a position As mentioned earlier we run a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 15 names Of those 4 to 7 are targeted to be core positions that ultimately determine our performance Because we are concentrated we own material stakes in many of our portfolio companies of often more than 5 and sometimes more than 10 of outstanding shares This outsized stake in each company we invest in typically provides significant leverage in working with company management After identifying areas where we can be helpful to management and the board we will bring our constructive activism to the process and in so doing aim to help the company to unlock the catalysts that we have identified We believe the microcap market provides a number of advantages for us as investors relative to larger markets One of those is that there are significantly fewer investors picking over the many stocks that make up this market So while we may be fishing in a fairly small pond we believe we are one of a limited number of institutional investors that actually has a pole in the water This characteristic provides us with the opportunity to try and find investment opportunities before their businesses turn and attract the interest of more investorsA second advantage is that because these companies are relatively quiet and small and additionally often lack experience with the public markets they often are open to working with us constructively to find ways to increase investor interest in their companies Also due to the size and the fact that many microcap companies should probably not be standalone public companies to begin with there is significantly more merger and acquisition activity than in the larger public markets One downside to the microcap market is that in a bearish environment thes,6,2023-10-20,8
6,AMLP: A Good Inflation Hedge With Lower Volatility Than Most Energy Investments,If you believe energy prices and inflation will be higher for longer but prefer to avoid the volatility of upstream oil and gas equities the Alerian MLP ETF  may be an investment vehicle toBut why invest in midstream MLPs Three reasonsThat said if you purchase the units of PAA EPD or MPLX directly you will achieve a better yield because the fees charged by AMLP are rather high However besides the diversification benefit the ETF also provides a wrapper around the K1 forms issued by individual MLPs While receiving a K1 isnt the end of the world many investors prefer to avoid the tax complexityAMLP may be particularly attractive if you think the Fed is approaching the end of its tightening cycle and we are headed into financial repression ie lower artificially managed interest rates while inflation has not fully receded Historically just as other highyield investments MLPs have underperformed when interest rates were high However this time perhaps because it is still recovering from the pandemic selloff AMLP has held up surprisingly well If the Fed pivots in the face of rising fiscal deficits I would expect AMLP to eventually rerate higherMidstream assets ought to do well in an inflationary regime because they are hard assets and also represent critical infrastructure  there is no substitute The only threat could be a rapid transition to renewables but that is simply not realistic as pointed out by EPD in a  presentationFurther as  upstream production is getting more gassy and this puts more pressure on the midstream segmentAs the Permians gas output is growing it is good to  that Appalachia is already constrained by offtake capacityThis promises for an interesting dynamic Both US LNG export capacity and upstream gas production are growing but the midstream capacity that links the two is lagging behind I think this is good for the owners of the existing infrastructureIn fact the midstream bull thesis extends beyond energy to petrochemicals as wellThe US has excess ethane which after getting cracked into ethylene is a basic petchem building block and managing the oversupply will put further premium on storage and export terminals along the US Gulf CoastWhile some midstream companies are organized as Ccorps similar to most traded stocks others are MLPs or publicly traded partnerships Unlike Ccorps MLPs are passthrough entities from federal income tax perspective which theoretically results in a lower cost of capitalA good  is MPLX which is  by Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC is the GP general partner in the MLP that is responsible for the commercial decisions In this case MPC isnt only the GP but also owns 65 of the common units  the common unit holders are basically the limited partners In MPLXs case only 35 of the common units are owned by investors and traded publicly but there is no reason why that percentage cant be different MLPs can also have preferred unitsWhile not all MLPs are linked to a corporation in the MPCMPLX setup the MLP gets a lot of revenue from the sponsor ie MPLX provides its infrastructure for MPCs use This usually happens under longterm agreements with minimum payment obligations to shift risk away from the MLP to the sponsor The GPs may also frequently have incentive distribution rights which act similarly to carried interest and increase the GPs returns after certain return hurdles are reached by the common unit holdersAs the GP controls the MLP from a commercial perspective the partnership agreement has certain safeguards to protect the common unit holders Usually all available cash above some minimal level has to be distributed quarterly Unlike a REIT the distribution requirement is not taxdriven However similarly to a REIT an MLP must derive at least 90 of its income from qualifying activities operating midstream energy infrastructure is of course a qualifying activityThe MLP s,7,2023-10-24,7
7,W&T Offshore: A Q3 Beat Could Be A Catalyst For This Undervalued Stock,WT Offshore  is small and undervalued offshore oil and gas producer in the US Gulf of Mexico Based on a recent precedent transaction the implied value of WTs hydrocarbon reserves could be at least 15 billion which significantlyWhile WT has struggled this year due to unexpected operational problems and weaker oil and gas prices the stock seems to have found a bottom in April and has since been hovering in this support regionWith the Holy Grail drilling prospect out of the picture until 2024 WTI is still in search of a catalyst In the meantime the renewed strength in oil prices In the medium term rising natural gas prices and oil prices proving they are able to hold their current levels will provide further tailwinds going into 2024Value can mean different things to different people but it is usually associated with low pricing multiples Seeking Alpha  the company A on valuation based on how WTs ratios compare to the peer sectorHowever while A looks pretty good it doesnt capture WTs full potential These ratios are based on flow measures EBITDA EBIT Sales and WT is currently underperforming on these dimensions due to Yet while investors value current profits an oil and gas company is also a claim on the underlying reserves Therefore a company can also be a value stock if it trades at a discount to its net asset value or NAV In my view this has indeed been the case and WTs discount to its NAV is significantThe  its PV10 a standardized NAV measure commonly used in the industryProved reserves or 1P was estimated at 2 billion Adding probable reserves increases this figure to 34 billion This compares to an enterprise value of 845 million Even focusing conservatively only on the producing portion of the 1P reserves suggests a PV10 of 14 billionThe PV10 though follows a standardized methodology that uses backwardlooking pricing so it isnt the same as a market value However WTs  of producing assets in the US GoM provides another angle from which we can look at thisPart of the reason WT delayed drilling its Holy Grail prospect was to conserve cash that could be used for opportunistic acquisitions It seems the company was indeed able to find suitable assets to acquireThis suggests WT paid about 100 per 1P boe or 63 per 2P boe applying these metrics to WTs legacy reserve base implies a NAV of about 15 billionMore of the acquired proved reserves are producing relative to legacy WT and the oil content is higher but on the other hand the acquisition is only 2 of WTs size Scale typically drives a premium so you could also say the 15 billion estimate is rather conservativeBased on WTs capital structure for the enterprise value to get to 15 billion the stock price would need to increase from 414 to 865 for a 109 gain The Wall Street target reported by Seeking Alpha is even north of my estimateFrom a value perspective WT has the potential to double The question is what could prompt the move upWTI is expected to report on November 1 According to Seeking Alpha the consensus estimates are revenue of 129 million and EPS of 0 However both oil and natural gas are tracking above the summer forecasts so the setup for a beat is favorableThe Q1 production issues  by now Based on managements midproduction guidance plus the realized Q3 marker prices assuming historical pricing differentials I estimate Q3 revenue at 137 millionIf revenue is a beat even by 5 very likely EPS will be a beat too Further given WT cut its initial capex guidance for the year and 2023 is rather light on plugging  abandonment expense I wouldnt be surprised if free cash flow comes out good tooLooking further ahead to Q4 WT would exit 2023 at about 3x EVEBITDANote that while 50 of WTIs production is gas the oil price is still more important as a revenueEBITDA driver WTI doesnt have oil hedges Gas is still 23 hedged but that ,10,2023-10-19,1

9,Transocean: Let's Do The Convertible Bond Math,I recently wrote about the improvement in Transoceans  credit prospects and what it could mean for the equityOne watch area that I identified were Transoceans convertible bondsAs I pointed out all convertibles are now in the money and this may imply up to 20 dilution for the equity holders Interestingly during the subsequent  RIGs management also emphasized this pointGiven we may now theoretically exit Q3 at northOne view is that everything is already priced in clearly the potential dilutive effect has been known since  when these bonds were issued From accounting perspective Transocean even records a liability associated with the moneyness of the exchange featureHowever what I want to show is that abstracting oneself away from what is or isnt priced in and just looking at the intrinsic value of the shares the exercise of the conversion options would potentially reduce this intrinsic value by 5 to 10 in most scenarios While not immaterial I think that 5 to 10 is small compared to the fundamental uncertainty over how much Transoceans underlying assets would be worth in say 2025In other words the conversion by itself shouldnt really change your bullish or bearish stance on the stock although shortterm buying opportunities could arise if the bondholders who avail themselves of the conversion option also seek to divest their newly minted shares Interestingly a corollary of the balance sheet mechanics is that if you are very bearish on Transocean the conversion should make you relatively more bullishFinally while in the long term the conversion could be a wash for the equity what is undisputable in my view is that it will be very bullish for the nonconvertible debt especially for the junior bonds which currently rank below the convertibles Despite the spread compression I described in my prior article these junior notes still offer an attractive yield for what at this point isnt that much riskA convertible bond can be seen as a combination of a straight bond and a call option on the equity We know from the theory that the early exercise of an option is never optimal but its not unusual that institutional factors may dictate otherwise For example distressed debt investors may rather get their money out and put it into another investment consistent with their mandate than retain longterm exposure to Transoceans equity As the conversion options are now deep in the money the primary driver for future bond gains would be the equity itselfInsider Perestroika already converted a lot of its debt in Q2 and this was already noted in a  from JuneNow that the 10Q is out we can also see the corresponding growth in the share countIf the remaining options get exercised this quarter going into the next quarter we are looking at a little more than 900 million outstanding sharesAs the conversion substitutes debt for equity the expected 20 dilution doesnt mean that the intrinsic value of the shares will drop by 20 too To quantify the effect we need to have a view on the fair value of the asset side of the balance sheetTo make things easy I am going to assume an average value of 450 million for the 27 active floaters As its an average youll have units such as the Titan and Atlas well above and older units below that mark I will assume zero value for the 12 stacked units If these assumptions dont seem reasonable to you dont worry I also ran a sensitivity analysis that shows how the impact of the conversion changes with the asset valuesGiven various estimates from offshore drilling earnings calls that suggest up to 1 billion cost for a newbuild I dont think 450 million is aggressive especially as I dont include any contracted backlog either In total my assumptions suggest fixed assets value of 1215 billion which is still below the latest net book value of 1692 billion Perhaps as additional reference point Deep Value Driller AS a company listed in Norw,97,2023-08-21,8

18,Energy Income Weekly: The Energy Sector Starts To Outperform,It was another week of outperformance for the energy sector Increasing oil prices raised the prospect of higher inflation which in turn pushed up Treasury yields and pushed down the SP 500  TheThe energy sector  was the topperforming sector in the SP 500 gaining 14 largely in response to WTIs 23 gain EPs  underperformed the oil price rising only 06 on the week and oilfield services  performed slightly better trading up 10Midstream underperformed for yet another week which is to be expected due to the segments relatively low direct exposure to oil prices The Alerian MLP Index declined 18 on the weekPositive inventory data supported oil prices US crude oil inventories declined by 63 millionThe oil markets fundamental outlook is set to gain additional support from Saudi Arabias export reduction The chart below courtesy of Vortexa shows that Saudi exports began to fall in August instead of July when its production cut began The timing of its export reduction will translate to falling onshore inventories in October and beyond as shipments arrive at their destinationsMajor consultancies see supply deficits even greater than our own forecasts Rystad for instance is  a massive 27 million barrel per day supply deficit in the fourth quarter As the supply deficit hits onshore inventories it is likely to push crude prices higher We expect it to push WTI into the 90s per barrelThe main obstacle to higher prices will come from the release of Chinas reserves accumulated over recent quarters at low prices Reserve releases are even more likely after Saudi Aramcos  that it was increasing prices to its Chinese customersWhile Chinas reserve releases are likely to prevent an oil price spike and could reduce crudes nearterm upside we dont expect them to be large enough to overwhelm the supply deficit which we expect to remove roughly 200 million barrels from global inventories from September through yearend Given where global inventories stand further draws are likely to exert upward pressure on prices And once Chinas reserve releases have run their course that pressure will intensifyOne of the most interesting developments during the week was the energy sectors 34 outperformance of the technologyheavy Nasdaq If oil prices continue to increase as we expect the same dynamics that sent energy shares higher and tech shares lower this week are likely to continue as higher energy prices translate to higher interest rates Higher interest rates suppress technology and other growth stock valuations because they make it easy for investors to obtain a high return at no risk  instead of having to wait for uncertain growth to provide a competitive return in the distant future They thereby incentivize the flow of capital away from technology and other growth stocks and toward sectors that offer immediate cash flow and inflation resistance with the energy sector being the most obvious beneficiary Investors should position accordingly before energys outperformance grows more pronouncedThe biggest energy income news during the week was Enbridges   of natural gas utility assets from Dominion Energy  ENB stock ended the week down 56 reflecting the markets concerns about the companys strategic direction and its lofty leverage metricsDespite the markets negative reaction the deal came at an attractive price and will diversify ENBs operations away from lowgrowth liquids We like the deal ENB is following TC Energy  in favoring its natural gas assets while reducing its liquids exposure At the moment TRP stock is more undervalued than ENB even after ENBs selloff during the week We continue to prefer TRP to ENB for a multiyear holding periodMidstream weakness was concentrated in natural gasweighted names as gas prices declined 58 Williams  Kinder Morgan  Oneok  and Antero Midstream  all traded at least 20 lowerBut even liquidsweighted na,8,2023-09-12,5

21,BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,How does BHP Group Limited  one of the largest diversified mining companies globally fit into an energy investment thesisDespite the exceptional 20212022 runup energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities  particularly among stocks withThat in a nutshell is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too However I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand Perhaps emerging economies like India INDA manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs  or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughsI personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities For example cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an environmentally conscious voter base In either case for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even netzero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this This naturally points to the mining industry as a hedge if oil gets phased out faster  and within mining BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resourcesBHPs mining portfolio has shifted over the years but after the  to Woodside  currently the group focuses on the If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker it has to consume a lot more of BHPs products at least in the next few decades to build out the new infrastructure that would support a lowcarbon economy Mining itself is very energy intensive so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels but lets assume thats only a shortterm effect and in the longrun net fossil fuel use will still dropBHP is certainly not the only miner out there but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand outBHPs yeartodate return is a negative 72 but lets be clear  the only reason for this years underperformance are fears over Chinas economy Yet the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors China sentiment may have bottomed The markets are also forward looking so commodity futures and BHPs stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving As much as China remains the main risk the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higherThe short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything The Tesla  in your garage only substitutes one type of nonrenewable resource for a different one Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply To the IEAs credit their  entitled Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions tried to quantify these exact megatrendsThe IEA distinguishes between a stated policies scenario STEPS associated with a slower energy transition and a sustainable development scenario or SDS which implies even faster decarbonization The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels by resource typeCopper demand of relevance to BHP is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x depending on how quickly the energy transition moves In 2020 the world,33,2023-10-08,7
22,Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at 595B This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang the market didnt seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes transaction costs or asymmetric information about managements intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the companys future investment opportunities For example one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musks company isnt known for paying dividends but the market rightly or wrongly puts a very high value on its investment opportunitiesThe Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified Investors pay taxes and transaction costs a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining managements ability to invest in negative present value projects Last but not least many individual and institutional investors simply need current income You could theoretically generate income from a nondividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costsIn practice companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities  You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of managements confidence in the stability of the business Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isnt obliged to maintain them in bad yearsImportantly a very high dividend  or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage  doesnt by itself make for a good dividend stock If anything leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project The dividend may also be at risk of being cut ie the stock may be a dividend trapAt the end of the day oil  gas is a cyclical industry and producers cant control the price of their output For this reason large US independents like Marathon Oil  APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividendsExxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays but its still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staplesIt depends on your time horizon Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter  Gamble However a nice  dividend growth series doesnt mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from 250 to 250 The financial leverage also tends to yoyo a bitUnsurprisingly the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if youre a buyandhold investor though I would say yes Even if you never sell any stocks you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever To illustrate this point I ran a backtest that assumes you started with 1000 in January 2001 and invested another 1000 each month thereafter all the way through September 2023 I compared Exxon to PG as a typical consumer staples company and to Devon  as a more risky upstream player I assume,43,2023-10-15,7

25,180 Degree Of Separation From The Investment Hoard,   Our Graham  Dodd approach allows us to identify undervalued companies whose stocks we believe provide the opportunity for 100 appreciation over a onetothreeyear cycle Focusing on microcaps means we are participating in a market where there are significantly fewer sophisticated investors which we believe means there are more opportunities for us to unearth than would otherwise be available amongst larger market capitalization companies We also believe that being concentrated allows our investors to have the potential to achieve higher returns if we get our stock picking right than could be generated from diversified funds Of course the converse is possible if our stock selections do not perform as we believe they can and their stocks decline in value This risk is why we first ask ourselves How much do we believe we can lose on each investment so that we manage risks appropriately We are not afraid to walk away from an investment at a loss if the investment thesis is no longer applicableAnd lastly by being constructive activists we think and act as engaged owners like principals in a handson working relationship with managements which is unlike most traditional passive institutional investors We are able to work hand in hand with our portfolio companies in order to unlock the value that we believe we have identified through our analysis We apply a number of traditional value investor screens to the publicly traded microcap market All of the other pieces of our investment approach in particular our concentration and constructive activism are predicated on first identifying companies that we believe are undervalued relative to other comparable companies in the marketplace as well as undervalued relative to that companys longerterm earnings powerThis initial screening is followed by a deep dive into their management the strength of their current and prospective business and a rigorous analysis of their financial statements If this analysis yields a catalyst that we are able to identify and that we believe should it occur will lead to a sharp increase of the stock price of a target company then we will initiate a position As mentioned earlier we run a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 15 names Of those 4 to 7 are targeted to be core positions that ultimately determine our performance Because we are concentrated we own material stakes in many of our portfolio companies of often more than 5 and sometimes more than 10 of outstanding shares This outsized stake in each company we invest in typically provides significant leverage in working with company management After identifying areas where we can be helpful to management and the board we will bring our constructive activism to the process and in so doing aim to help the company to unlock the catalysts that we have identified We believe the microcap market provides a number of advantages for us as investors relative to larger markets One of those is that there are significantly fewer investors picking over the many stocks that make up this market So while we may be fishing in a fairly small pond we believe we are one of a limited number of institutional investors that actually has a pole in the water This characteristic provides us with the opportunity to try and find investment opportunities before their businesses turn and attract the interest of more investorsA second advantage is that because these companies are relatively quiet and small and additionally often lack experience with the public markets they often are open to working with us constructively to find ways to increase investor interest in their companies Also due to the size and the fact that many microcap companies should probably not be standalone public companies to begin with there is significantly more merger and acquisition activity than in the larger public markets One downside to the microcap market is that in a bearish environment thes,6,2023-10-20,8

29,Transocean: Let's Do The Convertible Bond Math,I recently wrote about the improvement in Transoceans  credit prospects and what it could mean for the equityOne watch area that I identified were Transoceans convertible bondsAs I pointed out all convertibles are now in the money and this may imply up to 20 dilution for the equity holders Interestingly during the subsequent  RIGs management also emphasized this pointGiven we may now theoretically exit Q3 at northOne view is that everything is already priced in clearly the potential dilutive effect has been known since  when these bonds were issued From accounting perspective Transocean even records a liability associated with the moneyness of the exchange featureHowever what I want to show is that abstracting oneself away from what is or isnt priced in and just looking at the intrinsic value of the shares the exercise of the conversion options would potentially reduce this intrinsic value by 5 to 10 in most scenarios While not immaterial I think that 5 to 10 is small compared to the fundamental uncertainty over how much Transoceans underlying assets would be worth in say 2025In other words the conversion by itself shouldnt really change your bullish or bearish stance on the stock although shortterm buying opportunities could arise if the bondholders who avail themselves of the conversion option also seek to divest their newly minted shares Interestingly a corollary of the balance sheet mechanics is that if you are very bearish on Transocean the conversion should make you relatively more bullishFinally while in the long term the conversion could be a wash for the equity what is undisputable in my view is that it will be very bullish for the nonconvertible debt especially for the junior bonds which currently rank below the convertibles Despite the spread compression I described in my prior article these junior notes still offer an attractive yield for what at this point isnt that much riskA convertible bond can be seen as a combination of a straight bond and a call option on the equity We know from the theory that the early exercise of an option is never optimal but its not unusual that institutional factors may dictate otherwise For example distressed debt investors may rather get their money out and put it into another investment consistent with their mandate than retain longterm exposure to Transoceans equity As the conversion options are now deep in the money the primary driver for future bond gains would be the equity itselfInsider Perestroika already converted a lot of its debt in Q2 and this was already noted in a  from JuneNow that the 10Q is out we can also see the corresponding growth in the share countIf the remaining options get exercised this quarter going into the next quarter we are looking at a little more than 900 million outstanding sharesAs the conversion substitutes debt for equity the expected 20 dilution doesnt mean that the intrinsic value of the shares will drop by 20 too To quantify the effect we need to have a view on the fair value of the asset side of the balance sheetTo make things easy I am going to assume an average value of 450 million for the 27 active floaters As its an average youll have units such as the Titan and Atlas well above and older units below that mark I will assume zero value for the 12 stacked units If these assumptions dont seem reasonable to you dont worry I also ran a sensitivity analysis that shows how the impact of the conversion changes with the asset valuesGiven various estimates from offshore drilling earnings calls that suggest up to 1 billion cost for a newbuild I dont think 450 million is aggressive especially as I dont include any contracted backlog either In total my assumptions suggest fixed assets value of 1215 billion which is still below the latest net book value of 1692 billion Perhaps as additional reference point Deep Value Driller AS a company listed in Norw,97,2023-08-21,8

35,Why TC Energy Is A Better Buy Than Enbridge,When we first saw the news that Enbridge Inc  would acquire Dominion Energys  utility assets which we discussed On closer inspection our analysis shows that ENB wont benefit from a split into standalone liquids and nonliquids companies In fact it could cause the company to lose some of the valuation premium it enjoys from its stability and diversification ENBsOver the past year TRPs shares sank as investors grew concerned about the companys high leverage lack of progress in deleveraging and a series of operational setbacks that included massive cost overruns in its Coastal GasLink project and an oil spill from its Keystone Pipeline TRPs selloff caused its shares to trade significantly below our price targetOn the evening of July 28 the company  that it would sell its Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf assets for 52 billion Investors were disappointed by the low 105x EBITDA multiple that the Columbia assets fetched The next day TRPs share price fell as much as 76 to a 101x EVEBITDA multiple the lowest market valuation since 2005 and well below the shares longterm average multiple of 120x as shown in the chart belowAs TRP shares sunk to historic lows their longterm investment proposition became more attractive A simple reversion of their trading multiple back to its historical average would spur a significant increase in the share priceTo get there the company would have to show progress deleveraging and improving its operational track record We believed that both were likely over the coming quarters However the spinoff announcement which was made the same day as the Columbia asset sale was announced added an interesting wrinkle to the TRP investment proposition By separating its liquids segment from the rest of its businesswhich operates primarily in natural gas pipelines and utilitiesTRP could eliminate a segment that acted as a drag on its stocks trading multiple Liquidsfocused longhaul pipeline businesses trade at EVEBITDA multiples below 100x By contrast a pureplay natural gas and utilities business would trade in line with publiclylisted peers at an EVEBITDA multiple greater than 115x well in excess of TRPs 101x Moreover the two new standalone entities could benefit from greater operational focus and from management teams that are more strongly incentivized to expand in their respective marketsToday TRP shares trade at a 105x EVEBITDA multiple As such they still offer significant upside if their multiple rerates to 115x or aboveIf TRP can complete its Coastal GasLink project generate strong operating and financial results as it did in the second quarter and reduce leverage through a combination of EBITDA growth asset sales andor paring back growth capex we believe its multiple can revert back to its former highs The spinoff makes such an outcome more likely because TRP will have jettisoned its lowmultiple lowgrowthbut highprofileliquids assets The remaining assets will garner a much higher multipleThe following figures shed some light on the impact of TRPs planned business separation for current shareholders An Adjusted EBITDA breakdown by segment for 2023 and 2024 is shown belowIf we apply the appropriate EVEBITDA multiples to these Adjusted EBITDA estimates we get the following values for TRPs separate liquids and nonliquids businessesAt low EVEBITDA valuation multiples we estimate the separated entities are worth 5554 per TRP share whereas at high multiples their value increases to 6572 These prices imply 127 and 333 upside from TRPs current share price of 4930The highvalue scenario is consistent with a 145x PE ratio In the years before 2023 TRPs shares traded in a PE range of 14x to 20xIn contrast with TRP we estimate that ENB shares have less upside in a separation scenario If ENBs management acquired the Dominion utility assets in the hope of securing a permanently higher multiple after a spl,15,2023-09-26,8
36,Exxon Mobil: Earnings May Be Down But Oil Price-Adjusted ROCE Is The Highest In 15 Years,Exxon Mobil  posted  that are down sequentially and yearonyearThe bearish thesis is that the 2022 results were an anomaly sparked off by the geopolitical worries As oil prices have receded from theThese arguments miss the point Exxon doesnt control the oil price and earnings will always vary with the commodity Rather Exxons job is to allocate capital among competing assets and maximize its capital returns for any given commodity price realizationWhen adjusted for the oil price Exxons return on capital employed or ROCE for 20222023 is superior to more than a decade of prior returns XOMs ROCE to oil price relationship is now more consistent with the late 1990searly 2000s which was a better period forFor this reason the past several quarters shouldnt be dismissed as a fluke I believe we are seeing a transformational change that will result in structurally higher capital returns for Exxon over the coming years From this perspective stock price comparisons to the 2010s should consider the vastly improved ROCE tooROCE is a standard way to  value creation in the energy industryThe numerator is net operating profit after taxes ie excluding interest to account for different capital structures The denominator reflects the total assets of the business net of current liabilities which can be seen as a noninterest bearing source of financingGoing back to Exxon I summarize below 30 years of annualized quarterly ROCE data from 1994 to 2023 plotted against the inflationadjusted Brent price  for the respective quartersI have highlighted two time periods that stand out as distinct clusters 19942008 preGFC and 20092021 postGFC Within both periods there is a linear relationship between ROCE and the oil price However for the postGFC period ROCE is about 10 lower for the same oil price levelEnergy expert  has talked about a high ROCE period from 1991 to 2006 followed by a low ROCE period between 20062020 Paradoxically as Murti notes most of the lowROCE period had higher oil prices at least until 2014 but the returns on capital were nonetheless still poorOne explanation favored by Murti is that ROCE is inversely related to investment and the lowROCE period was characterized by chronic overinvestment However I think there is more nuance to the storyPeople forget this but a few decades ago Exxon and Chevron  along with the other majors were valued not just for their oil reserves but also for their knowhow Back then oilrich foreign countries were perhaps not as technologically sophisticated so working with the majors offered the best way to unlock the value of their reservesHowever sometime in the 2000s national oil companies or NOCs started displacing the majors as  from 2012Further Bain noted at the time that NOCs were becoming increasingly comfortable and adept at procuring human and technical resources from oilfield services companies which have grown dramatically in size and capability In other words if you are an NOC why not cut out the middleman and work directly with a Schlumberger  or a Halliburton This dynamic is part of the reason why I am  on the oilfield services component of the energy sector but with regard to Exxon or Chevron one could also see the postGFC overinvestment as driven by necessity as much as by greed If NOCs chose to develop the highest ROI assets by themselves that logically leaves the lower return prospects for the majorsThe good news going back to the ROCE scatterplot is that the oil priceadjusted 20222023 numbers are moving back to the 19942008 high ROCE trendline For five of the past six quarters ROCE has been much higher than in the 20092021 period when the inflationadjusted Brent price was similarThis says to me that we are seeing a structural change which I would attribute to the costcutting and optimization efforts that were spurred by the 2020 lowpoint Investment has also been lowe,12,2023-08-07,1
37,"Ørsted A/S: Don't Buy The Dip, The Wind Industry's Problems Are Structural",I looked at Ørsted AS   in March 2022 when  based on the macro trifecta of commodity inflation rising interest rates and economic protectionismThe stock is down 50 sinceHowever it puzzles me that as Ørsted was sliding down Seeking Alpha analysts published 9 buystrong buy and only 2 hold articles without any new bearish takes despite the multiple warning signs that offshore wind is currently not a healthy sector A unifying theme across the bullish articles appears to be that Ørsted is somehow undervalued because it was trading at a higher price beforeAs Ørsted crashed 25 just in one dayEventually one of the bullish calls will probably be right but until then you can lose a lot of your net worth by trying to catch the proverbial falling knife especially when the fundamentals are against you So allow me to explain why 18 months later my bearish call on wind energy still stands and why thinking that Ørsted will allow you to profit from the energy transition is rather naiveThe main reason why wind and solar stocks are crashing is that in the first place they only went up so high due to the massive liquidity wave and zero interest rate policies unleashed by central banks during the pandemic As liquidity tightened and US rates are now above 5 there has been a gravitational pull on longduration stocks that promise to deliver cash flows far out into the future In this regard renewable energy is following the path of other Covid bubblesNote the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF  is still up 86 from early 2020 which suggests the bubble deflation process may still have some runway leftMoreover high interest rates dont just influence wind and solar stocks through the discount factor but also have a direct impact on the attractiveness of project finance For example in a recent article the Wall Street Journal  that financing costs for solar projects had gone up by 30 compared to a few years ago due to higher interest ratesWithout doubt a second reason for the 20202021 outperformance of Ørsted and other renewable energy stocks has been the rise of the socalled ESG investing ESG is hazy concept but lets say the idea behind it is that fund managers should be scored not just on the returns of their portfolio but also based on the extent to which their holdings contribute to environmental and social goals including of course decarbonizationESG investing has had important repercussions across the investment industry includingProverbially you know that a new trend is over when one of the major business magazines proclaims it is going to be the future forever and with ESG investing I think we  that point 12 years agoThe linked Forbes article cites a PwC prediction that ESGoriented assets under management are toOne should approach studies sponsored by consulting firms with similar skepticism as the business magazine covers Ultimately consultancies are trying to sell more of their services and are tailoring their marketing message to the dominant trend but that by itself is also a lagging indicatorSo what is the leading indicator then I think it could be Larry Fink the head of BlackRock  which is the worlds largest asset manager backtracking on whole the ESG investing idea as featured It seems that we now even have  Its not a perfect indicator but when someone creates an inverse ETF it usually indicates there is already sufficient interest in the contrarian thesisSo long story short I think the times are changing again and I see a strengthening push towards evaluating investment performance based on more traditional metrics Ørsted can ring the carbon alarm bell as much as it likes see my comments on their earnings call below but unless they start generating tangible returns investors may keep them in the penalty boxOne of the greatest paradoxes in the renewables landscape is that building out the infrastructure requires a lot of traditional energy To q,10,2023-09-05,6
38,Energy Income Weekly: The Energy Sector Starts To Outperform,It was another week of outperformance for the energy sector Increasing oil prices raised the prospect of higher inflation which in turn pushed up Treasury yields and pushed down the SP 500  TheThe energy sector  was the topperforming sector in the SP 500 gaining 14 largely in response to WTIs 23 gain EPs  underperformed the oil price rising only 06 on the week and oilfield services  performed slightly better trading up 10Midstream underperformed for yet another week which is to be expected due to the segments relatively low direct exposure to oil prices The Alerian MLP Index declined 18 on the weekPositive inventory data supported oil prices US crude oil inventories declined by 63 millionThe oil markets fundamental outlook is set to gain additional support from Saudi Arabias export reduction The chart below courtesy of Vortexa shows that Saudi exports began to fall in August instead of July when its production cut began The timing of its export reduction will translate to falling onshore inventories in October and beyond as shipments arrive at their destinationsMajor consultancies see supply deficits even greater than our own forecasts Rystad for instance is  a massive 27 million barrel per day supply deficit in the fourth quarter As the supply deficit hits onshore inventories it is likely to push crude prices higher We expect it to push WTI into the 90s per barrelThe main obstacle to higher prices will come from the release of Chinas reserves accumulated over recent quarters at low prices Reserve releases are even more likely after Saudi Aramcos  that it was increasing prices to its Chinese customersWhile Chinas reserve releases are likely to prevent an oil price spike and could reduce crudes nearterm upside we dont expect them to be large enough to overwhelm the supply deficit which we expect to remove roughly 200 million barrels from global inventories from September through yearend Given where global inventories stand further draws are likely to exert upward pressure on prices And once Chinas reserve releases have run their course that pressure will intensifyOne of the most interesting developments during the week was the energy sectors 34 outperformance of the technologyheavy Nasdaq If oil prices continue to increase as we expect the same dynamics that sent energy shares higher and tech shares lower this week are likely to continue as higher energy prices translate to higher interest rates Higher interest rates suppress technology and other growth stock valuations because they make it easy for investors to obtain a high return at no risk  instead of having to wait for uncertain growth to provide a competitive return in the distant future They thereby incentivize the flow of capital away from technology and other growth stocks and toward sectors that offer immediate cash flow and inflation resistance with the energy sector being the most obvious beneficiary Investors should position accordingly before energys outperformance grows more pronouncedThe biggest energy income news during the week was Enbridges   of natural gas utility assets from Dominion Energy  ENB stock ended the week down 56 reflecting the markets concerns about the companys strategic direction and its lofty leverage metricsDespite the markets negative reaction the deal came at an attractive price and will diversify ENBs operations away from lowgrowth liquids We like the deal ENB is following TC Energy  in favoring its natural gas assets while reducing its liquids exposure At the moment TRP stock is more undervalued than ENB even after ENBs selloff during the week We continue to prefer TRP to ENB for a multiyear holding periodMidstream weakness was concentrated in natural gasweighted names as gas prices declined 58 Williams  Kinder Morgan  Oneok  and Antero Midstream  all traded at least 20 lowerBut even liquidsweighted na,8,2023-09-12,5

43,ClearBridge All Cap Value Strategy Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,The yield on the 10year Treasury rose 74 basis points bps in the third quarter reaching the highest level in 16 years This higherrate backdrop has significant implications for companies that grew up during the zerointerest rate policy period of the last 15 years These companies became dependent on the incredibly low cost of capital stemming from this monetary policy creating real concerns today about business models that lack the ability to selffundThe attractiveness of defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples has also diminished given the rise in interest rates and the relative attractiveness of returns investors can earn on short and longterm government bonds helping to explain the underperformance of those sectors Higher financing costs add to a list of growing realworld bottlenecks hampering the buildout of renewables and AI infrastructure This could ultimately drive a forceful change in market leadership away from the Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks if the resulting growth comes in short of what is currently embedded in their share pricesMany businesses are threatened by a higher cost of capital but one where reality has set in and which also touches many other growth areas of the market is the utility company NextEra Energy  Over the past few years the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act The problem for NextEra and the transition broadly is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital This requires high capital expenditures  often resulting in negative free cash flow  to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra To help the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners  providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically Ultimately the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog As a result the stock has declined by approximately 30 year to dateThis is merely one example of what is happening across industries at varying degrees of magnitude and rapidity leaving entire supply chains supporting renewable buildouts and related electrical grid infrastructure at risk This combined with a massive rerating in its valuation drove our decision to exit Quanta Services  during the quarter despite it being one of the biggest beneficiaries of the accelerating demand for renewables and electrical grid upgradesAdditionally we are seeing signs of other developments that could throw up roadblocks to capital expenditures both in renewables and elsewhere Access to skilled labor permitting for transmission power lines textbook Not in My Back Yard NIMBY pushback against landintensive solar and wind farms and potential ratepayer fatigue as utilities look to pass along the costs to consumers are all potential impediments to rapid deploymentWe believe this slower reworking of our electrical infrastructure has broader implications and could result in a much bigger market impact than the selloff in utilities in the third quarter Optimism around AI and perceptions of relative fundamental stability have helped drive a huge move higher in IT megacaps with the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index up 90 year to date compared to 13 for the SP 500 Index and 167 for the Russell 3000 Value Index Roughly half of the move higher in those mega caps has been from an increase in their forward PE ratios while the Russell 3000 Values multiple i,0,2023-10-18,6

45,Baker Hughes: The LNG Boom Can Be A Catalyst For This Stock,Baker Hughes Company  is one of the largest providers of oilfield services and equipment OFS globally It competes with the other two OFS majors Schlumberger  and Halliburton  asStructurally I am very bullish on OFS stocks  particularly those with offshore or international exposure or even select North America onshore service providers that differentiate themselves through stateoftheart technology or a more robust customer baseIn addition to checking the offshore and international boxes Baker Hughes also has a large industrial and energy technology IET business that supplies equipment eg gas turbines and services to the liquefied natural gas LNG value chainAs bullish as you may be on oil you have to acknowledge that a recession will temporarily bring down oil prices and investment However that isntIn a sudden change of heart governments started to worry about energy security which has led to a record number of LNG final investment decisions FIDs both on the export liquefaction plants and import regasification sides shipyard orders for LNG tankers are also at record highs In a paradoxical move perhaps underscoring how politically driven the whole energy transition debate has become the EU parliament even voted last year to Oil isnt robust to consumer gasoline jet fuel or industry petrochemical demand but natural gas is less cyclical due to its use for power generation and heating As Europe and Asia are short on gas that gas has to be brought from elsewhere and this requires investment in LNG infrastructure No matter which way things go for oil the LNG boom will continue to be a tailwind for Baker HughesI have laid out the macro foundations of my OFS thesis in prior articlesThe cornerstone of the OFS bull thesis is that we find ourselves in the early stages of a multiyear capex cycle not unlike 20022014 and will see increased spend across the energy value chain while the services capacity remains tight due to 20142020 attritionThe initial recovery in energy equities postpandemic left the OFS sector behindBack in 2021 the mainstream narrative was that upstream producers  would shy away from new investment while gradually depleting their developed production base to maximize oil price realizations and cash flows Under this capital discipline model OFS would see limited gainsHowever this narrative wasnt fully correct Since 2022 OFS stocks have performed relatively better than upstreamApart from the energy security wake up call there are a couple other reasons why the narrative has shifted from capital discipline to capex supercycleRight now US drilling rigs considered a profit driver for much of the OFS industry are downThis weighs on the OFS sector although the US is more of an outlier here International rigs Even US offshore rigs arent downThe negative press for OFS is largely reflective of US shale where mostly smaller private operators were forced to reduce rigsOutside of North America there are few signs that OFS demand is stallingNatural gas makes a lot of sense as a transitional fuel It emits almost 50 less carbon than coal provides reliable baseload and is fairly abundant Pipeline infrastructure achieves a lower transportation cost than LNG but as the European woes last winter showed pipelines also create mutual dependency on both sides of the trade In contrast LNG allows an importer to source from multiple potential suppliers and the spot trade as a proportion of total volumes has been increasing over timeUnfortunately it took European gas prices skyrocketing to 100 per MMBtu equivalent to 600barrel oil for policymakers to understand the benefitsIn the typical reactive fashion of our age we are now looking at record investments in the LNG sector According to the International Gas Unions 2023 LNG report my highlightsFor context the 2022 LNG trade was about 400 MTPA metric tons per annum,4,2023-08-13,4

48,NexTier Oilfield Solutions: Consider Taking Some Profits After The Rally,The regional banking worries back in March on the back of already crashing natural gas  prices opened up a decent value opportunity among some premium onshore oilfield services names including NexTier Oilfield Solutions The fundamental part of my argument seems to be largely holding out so far Onshore oilfield activity indeed moderated but it didnt fall through the floor NexTier as well as other onshore services companies are now calling the bottom sometime this Q3On the other hand the 40 runup has closed up the valuation gap to some extent Forward PE was at 26x when I wrote the  It has since risen to 42xItNonetheless since the announcement one NEX share is basically worth 0752 PTEN shares based on the merger terms so the NEX price now rather reflects the prospects of the future company I do think the PTENNEX combination will be a powerhouse for the reasons I covered before but the market will probably want to see some evidence the merger is working outThe two managements have promised for example 200 million in annual synergies which by my earlier estimate is about 10 addon to the combined pro forma EBITDA It will take some time for the integration to achieve its targets so in the meantime the major catalysts may be just the broader moves in oil  and natural gas pricesI am long NexTiers competitors Liberty Energy  and ProPetro  which also provide fracking services and too saw impressive runupsHowever consistent with my current sentiment toward NexTier I have scaled down my LBRT and PUMP positions in the anticipation of a possible correctionNEX had its  recently Impressively the company posted a modest 1 sequential increase in revenue despite the falling activity driversFrac fleets  from last year and at multiweek lows although they bounced back a bitSimilarly to its competitors NexTier thinks the activity bottom is nearNexTier expects a strong start to 2024Fracking companies are also more conscious of managing supply this time around and prefer to idle fleets than to erode pricingThe quality of equipment continues to matter as well as who your customers are and NEX believes it has an advantage in both areas Its now partner PTEN is also a premium services provider in the drilling space though it has a bit too much of exposure to private operators compared to some other drillersHowever in the shorter term I probably see more downside risk associated with integrating the two legacy companiesInvestment legend Michael Burrys  also disclosed a Q2 position in NexTier in the recent 13F filingInterestingly Burrys fund also had a position in Precision Drilling  another onshore oilfield services player which runs premium land rigs PDS had similar performance as NEX PUMP and LBRT over the last monthsUnfortunately we wont know if Michael Burry already sold until the Q3 filing which wont be available for quite a whileHowever what we do know is that NexTiers CEO sold 5 million worth of shares recentlyThe CEO still has a lot of shares left but perhaps this proves the point that after a strong runup its prudent to take some profitsWall Street gives about 20 upside to NEX from the current levelsHowever when I wrote my prior article the Wall Street target upside was 70I remain long both LBRT and PUMP but have scaled down after the recent runups I would approach NEX the same way but I am already overweight oilfield services Everyones individual circumstances will be different of course  My articles blog posts and comments on this platform do not constitute investment recommendations but rather express my personal opinions and are for informational purposes only I am not a registered investment advisor and none of my writings should be considered as investment advice While I do my best to ensure I present correct factual information I cannot guarantee that my articles or posts are errorfree You should perform your own due diligence befo,3,2023-08-17,1
49,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,This followup article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in US energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering 20072022 In this period the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet BCF of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas it is important to first reference some history Before that we want to lay out some relevant terminology Natural Gas not surprisingly is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature It is measured in cubic feet at sea level volume increases or decreases with pressure It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet MCFConveniently one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1036 million BTU one author has a friend who considers this one of the proofs of the existence of God and this makes certain calculations easier for example a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs After this removal the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumersFirst a little bit of simplified but instructive history Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers these phases have been 1 nuisance 2 luxury 3 necessity and 4 national security At first it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually flared In fact one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using noflare orders Natural gas began to be used in cities but this was largely city gas produced from coalIt dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks and pipelines started to make their way across the country All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions So far so goodThen the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and the FPC now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers The experts at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production There were various estimates most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by nowThis policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973 Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels fuels for power plants and in other applications As oil prices rose more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices In addition producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state intrastate gas was not price regulated leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those marketsA complex mess emerged  loved by lawyers and lobbyists but hated by the public Each interstate pipeline had curtailment proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand One point was widely agreed  natural gas could never be used under a boiler i,265,2023-10-09,6

I'm Buying The NextEra Energy Crash With Both Hands,Markets are in turmoil While the SP 500 is still holding up well real carnage has taken place in defensive sectors Looking at the data below we see that utilities real estate and consumer defensive stocks were among the biggest losers of the pastWhat were dealing with here is the realization that inflation is sticky This means the Fed will have to keep rates elevated for longer That wouldnt be such a bad thing if the economy were in better shapeThe market is now putting a 90 probability on a 450 Federal Funds rate 12 months from now In August that number was close to 60 In the first half of this year it was 0The worst thing on everyones mind at least on my mind is that Mr Powell may have to choose between protecting the economy versus fighting inflation soonLooking at the first chart of this article it is no surprise that energy stocks are doing well in this environment Energy stocks have pricing power Most major players have low breakeven prices healthy balance sheets and the ability to be profitable at subdued oil pricesConsumer staples REITs and regulated utilities are different While the strongest players have great balance sheets they often come with high gross debt levels and business models that make it hard to hike pricesRegulated utilities are no different emphasis addedThis brings me to  On August 11 I  that the company offered a compelling investing opportunity I was wrong Since then the stock has fallen 23Now the stock is down 45 from its alltime high yet its 10year total return is still 243 130 points above the weighted sector averageAs much as I hate being wrong Im doubling downWhile we can expect pressure to remain high on utilities the value is getting great at these levels which is why Im writing this articleSo lets get to itIn the lengthy introduction I already briefly explained the core of the problem sticky inflation and elevated ratesBloombergs  hit the nail on the headEssentially NextEras success is built on three pillars ownership of Florida Power  Light Co a reputation for efficiency and cost management and being the largest renewable power developer in the US I remember in 2020 and 2021 when rates were low and everyone was in love with renewables NextEra was one of the most popular stocks on the marketHowever the recent fall from grace can be attributed to the troubles faced by its subsidiary NextEra Energy Partners LP  The subsidiarys reduced expectations for dividend growth and challenges in selling planned projects led to a significant drop in its stock value impacting the parent companyAccording to the company during the September 27 Wolfe Utilities Midstream  Clean Energy Conference  emphasis addedThis is what Bloomberg wroteIn light of funding challenges and risks related to revenue growth it also does not help that investors get a better yield buying treasury notes as seen in the chart below When it comes to income there is no need to take huge risks Especially not when it comes to NEE which still yields less than 4Furthermore during the aforementioned conference the company acknowledged a slow start in the renewables market due to inflation interest rates and supply chain issuesHowever they are optimistic about the market gaining momentum in 2024 Despite increased power purchase agreement PPA prices renewables remain the lowcost generation optionAlso early signs of falling panel and battery prices along with resolving supply chain uncertainties are boosting the renewables market may be one of the most important things to keep in mind when investing However I also like to buy good investments at great prices When averaging down catching falling knives may not be the worst idea Ive done it many times In 2020 I did it with energy This year Im doing it with defense contractorsFor example Goldman Sachs  did cut its buy rating from 83 to 73 yet it remained ,185,2023-10-04,1
52,"NextEra Energy Partners: Is It Always Darkest Before Dawn, Or Pitch Black?",Over the past seven trading days the NextEra Energy Partners  unit price has fallen off a cliffAnalysts on Seeking Alpha and from numerous mainstream investment research groups have been piling on the gloomIn this article we will take a look at whether or not the dramatic stock price decline is justified by fundamentals and then offer our verdict on whether investors should get out before the lights at NEP go pitch black or if NEP has a good chance ofYes the market was likely not happy about the rough halving of the distribution growth guidance at NEP though no one who knew 1 where interest rates were 2 where its equity price was trading even before it recently lost half of its market value and 3 the sheer magnitude of its upcoming wall of CEPF and debt maturities believed that NEP was likely to achieve its lofty 12 distribution CAGR guidanceMoreover negative market sentiment was likely spurred further by the slew of downgrades and steep price target reductions from previously bullish mainstream investment analysts However based on the analysts commentary in most cases many of these downgrades seemed to be at least partially driven by chasing market sentiment rather than truly driven by fundamental analysis of the company itselfThe real reason for the selloff in the stock price  in our view  was the vicious cycle created by two major factorsThe main factor preventing NEE from rolling up NEP at this point is that it wants to limit its direct exposure to renewables in order to keep regulated assets at a higher percentage and therefore make the credit ratings agencies happy Could they eventually decide that they are going to roll up NEP anyway Absolutely However NEE has made it clear that an independent and healthy NEP is important to them being able to achieve their longterm growth goals by being able to develop and dropdown renewable assets to NEP thereby generating attractive profits for NEE via its renewables development business while also preserving its regulatedrenewables balance to protect its credit rating and retain a relatively attractive cost of debt capital so they are likely going to do everything they can to revive NEPs growth story before resorting to a rollupAs a result our view is that NEE is likely going to give NEP at least a few more years to try to recover an attractive cost of capital If those efforts fail  especially if NEP faces a choice between a distribution cut or financial distress  NEE could very likely go down the path of reabsorbing NEP This is a scenario that likely means that the current unit price decline is a case of it being darkest before pitch blackThat said we believe that there is still a very viable path for NEP to return to prosperity and that it could very well be darkest before dawn Here is the mathAfter Q1 management was expecting a December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA of 24172617 million based on the following assumptionsSince then the announced potential sale of their STX pipeline and the cancelation of an expected dropdown from their parent NextEra Energy  overwhelmed their other growth initiatives to reduce their December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA by nearly 500 million to 19302130 millionOn the positive side corporate expenses have declined by an expected 10 million and the IDR fees of 157 million have been suspended for the foreseeable future reducing the hit to the December 31 2023 runrate NEPlevel adjusted EBITDA to 320 million or 19002100 million Moreover debt service expense has also been reduced substantially given that the STX debt will be taken out and the expected debt costs on the dropdown asset also do not apply so that improves the midpoint of estimated pretax CAFD by another 135 million PreTax Tax Credit deductions also declined by 135 million at the midpoint NonCash Income deductions declined by 5 million at the midpoint and Main,292,2023-10-06,6

65,Baker Hughes: The LNG Boom Can Be A Catalyst For This Stock,Baker Hughes Company  is one of the largest providers of oilfield services and equipment OFS globally It competes with the other two OFS majors Schlumberger  and Halliburton  asStructurally I am very bullish on OFS stocks  particularly those with offshore or international exposure or even select North America onshore service providers that differentiate themselves through stateoftheart technology or a more robust customer baseIn addition to checking the offshore and international boxes Baker Hughes also has a large industrial and energy technology IET business that supplies equipment eg gas turbines and services to the liquefied natural gas LNG value chainAs bullish as you may be on oil you have to acknowledge that a recession will temporarily bring down oil prices and investment However that isntIn a sudden change of heart governments started to worry about energy security which has led to a record number of LNG final investment decisions FIDs both on the export liquefaction plants and import regasification sides shipyard orders for LNG tankers are also at record highs In a paradoxical move perhaps underscoring how politically driven the whole energy transition debate has become the EU parliament even voted last year to Oil isnt robust to consumer gasoline jet fuel or industry petrochemical demand but natural gas is less cyclical due to its use for power generation and heating As Europe and Asia are short on gas that gas has to be brought from elsewhere and this requires investment in LNG infrastructure No matter which way things go for oil the LNG boom will continue to be a tailwind for Baker HughesI have laid out the macro foundations of my OFS thesis in prior articlesThe cornerstone of the OFS bull thesis is that we find ourselves in the early stages of a multiyear capex cycle not unlike 20022014 and will see increased spend across the energy value chain while the services capacity remains tight due to 20142020 attritionThe initial recovery in energy equities postpandemic left the OFS sector behindBack in 2021 the mainstream narrative was that upstream producers  would shy away from new investment while gradually depleting their developed production base to maximize oil price realizations and cash flows Under this capital discipline model OFS would see limited gainsHowever this narrative wasnt fully correct Since 2022 OFS stocks have performed relatively better than upstreamApart from the energy security wake up call there are a couple other reasons why the narrative has shifted from capital discipline to capex supercycleRight now US drilling rigs considered a profit driver for much of the OFS industry are downThis weighs on the OFS sector although the US is more of an outlier here International rigs Even US offshore rigs arent downThe negative press for OFS is largely reflective of US shale where mostly smaller private operators were forced to reduce rigsOutside of North America there are few signs that OFS demand is stallingNatural gas makes a lot of sense as a transitional fuel It emits almost 50 less carbon than coal provides reliable baseload and is fairly abundant Pipeline infrastructure achieves a lower transportation cost than LNG but as the European woes last winter showed pipelines also create mutual dependency on both sides of the trade In contrast LNG allows an importer to source from multiple potential suppliers and the spot trade as a proportion of total volumes has been increasing over timeUnfortunately it took European gas prices skyrocketing to 100 per MMBtu equivalent to 600barrel oil for policymakers to understand the benefitsIn the typical reactive fashion of our age we are now looking at record investments in the LNG sector According to the International Gas Unions 2023 LNG report my highlightsFor context the 2022 LNG trade was about 400 MTPA metric tons per annum,4,2023-08-13,7

68,NexTier Oilfield Solutions: Consider Taking Some Profits After The Rally,The regional banking worries back in March on the back of already crashing natural gas  prices opened up a decent value opportunity among some premium onshore oilfield services names including NexTier Oilfield Solutions The fundamental part of my argument seems to be largely holding out so far Onshore oilfield activity indeed moderated but it didnt fall through the floor NexTier as well as other onshore services companies are now calling the bottom sometime this Q3On the other hand the 40 runup has closed up the valuation gap to some extent Forward PE was at 26x when I wrote the  It has since risen to 42xItNonetheless since the announcement one NEX share is basically worth 0752 PTEN shares based on the merger terms so the NEX price now rather reflects the prospects of the future company I do think the PTENNEX combination will be a powerhouse for the reasons I covered before but the market will probably want to see some evidence the merger is working outThe two managements have promised for example 200 million in annual synergies which by my earlier estimate is about 10 addon to the combined pro forma EBITDA It will take some time for the integration to achieve its targets so in the meantime the major catalysts may be just the broader moves in oil  and natural gas pricesI am long NexTiers competitors Liberty Energy  and ProPetro  which also provide fracking services and too saw impressive runupsHowever consistent with my current sentiment toward NexTier I have scaled down my LBRT and PUMP positions in the anticipation of a possible correctionNEX had its  recently Impressively the company posted a modest 1 sequential increase in revenue despite the falling activity driversFrac fleets  from last year and at multiweek lows although they bounced back a bitSimilarly to its competitors NexTier thinks the activity bottom is nearNexTier expects a strong start to 2024Fracking companies are also more conscious of managing supply this time around and prefer to idle fleets than to erode pricingThe quality of equipment continues to matter as well as who your customers are and NEX believes it has an advantage in both areas Its now partner PTEN is also a premium services provider in the drilling space though it has a bit too much of exposure to private operators compared to some other drillersHowever in the shorter term I probably see more downside risk associated with integrating the two legacy companiesInvestment legend Michael Burrys  also disclosed a Q2 position in NexTier in the recent 13F filingInterestingly Burrys fund also had a position in Precision Drilling  another onshore oilfield services player which runs premium land rigs PDS had similar performance as NEX PUMP and LBRT over the last monthsUnfortunately we wont know if Michael Burry already sold until the Q3 filing which wont be available for quite a whileHowever what we do know is that NexTiers CEO sold 5 million worth of shares recentlyThe CEO still has a lot of shares left but perhaps this proves the point that after a strong runup its prudent to take some profitsWall Street gives about 20 upside to NEX from the current levelsHowever when I wrote my prior article the Wall Street target upside was 70I remain long both LBRT and PUMP but have scaled down after the recent runups I would approach NEX the same way but I am already overweight oilfield services Everyones individual circumstances will be different of course  My articles blog posts and comments on this platform do not constitute investment recommendations but rather express my personal opinions and are for informational purposes only I am not a registered investment advisor and none of my writings should be considered as investment advice While I do my best to ensure I present correct factual information I cannot guarantee that my articles or posts are errorfree You should perform your own due diligence befo,3,2023-08-17,1
69,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,This followup article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in US energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering 20072022 In this period the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet BCF of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas it is important to first reference some history Before that we want to lay out some relevant terminology Natural Gas not surprisingly is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature It is measured in cubic feet at sea level volume increases or decreases with pressure It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet MCFConveniently one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1036 million BTU one author has a friend who considers this one of the proofs of the existence of God and this makes certain calculations easier for example a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs After this removal the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumersFirst a little bit of simplified but instructive history Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers these phases have been 1 nuisance 2 luxury 3 necessity and 4 national security At first it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually flared In fact one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using noflare orders Natural gas began to be used in cities but this was largely city gas produced from coalIt dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks and pipelines started to make their way across the country All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions So far so goodThen the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and the FPC now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers The experts at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production There were various estimates most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by nowThis policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973 Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels fuels for power plants and in other applications As oil prices rose more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices In addition producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state intrastate gas was not price regulated leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those marketsA complex mess emerged  loved by lawyers and lobbyists but hated by the public Each interstate pipeline had curtailment proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand One point was widely agreed  natural gas could never be used under a boiler i,265,2023-10-09,6

71,Down 45%! I'm Buying The NextEra Energy Crash With Both Hands,Markets are in turmoil While the SP 500 is still holding up well real carnage has taken place in defensive sectors Looking at the data below we see that utilities real estate and consumer defensive stocks were among the biggest losers of the pastWhat were dealing with here is the realization that inflation is sticky This means the Fed will have to keep rates elevated for longer That wouldnt be such a bad thing if the economy were in better shapeThe market is now putting a 90 probability on a 450 Federal Funds rate 12 months from now In August that number was close to 60 In the first half of this year it was 0The worst thing on everyones mind at least on my mind is that Mr Powell may have to choose between protecting the economy versus fighting inflation soonLooking at the first chart of this article it is no surprise that energy stocks are doing well in this environment Energy stocks have pricing power Most major players have low breakeven prices healthy balance sheets and the ability to be profitable at subdued oil pricesConsumer staples REITs and regulated utilities are different While the strongest players have great balance sheets they often come with high gross debt levels and business models that make it hard to hike pricesRegulated utilities are no different emphasis addedThis brings me to  On August 11 I  that the company offered a compelling investing opportunity I was wrong Since then the stock has fallen 23Now the stock is down 45 from its alltime high yet its 10year total return is still 243 130 points above the weighted sector averageAs much as I hate being wrong Im doubling downWhile we can expect pressure to remain high on utilities the value is getting great at these levels which is why Im writing this articleSo lets get to itIn the lengthy introduction I already briefly explained the core of the problem sticky inflation and elevated ratesBloombergs  hit the nail on the headEssentially NextEras success is built on three pillars ownership of Florida Power  Light Co a reputation for efficiency and cost management and being the largest renewable power developer in the US I remember in 2020 and 2021 when rates were low and everyone was in love with renewables NextEra was one of the most popular stocks on the marketHowever the recent fall from grace can be attributed to the troubles faced by its subsidiary NextEra Energy Partners LP  The subsidiarys reduced expectations for dividend growth and challenges in selling planned projects led to a significant drop in its stock value impacting the parent companyAccording to the company during the September 27 Wolfe Utilities Midstream  Clean Energy Conference  emphasis addedThis is what Bloomberg wroteIn light of funding challenges and risks related to revenue growth it also does not help that investors get a better yield buying treasury notes as seen in the chart below When it comes to income there is no need to take huge risks Especially not when it comes to NEE which still yields less than 4Furthermore during the aforementioned conference the company acknowledged a slow start in the renewables market due to inflation interest rates and supply chain issuesHowever they are optimistic about the market gaining momentum in 2024 Despite increased power purchase agreement PPA prices renewables remain the lowcost generation optionAlso early signs of falling panel and battery prices along with resolving supply chain uncertainties are boosting the renewables market may be one of the most important things to keep in mind when investing However I also like to buy good investments at great prices When averaging down catching falling knives may not be the worst idea Ive done it many times In 2020 I did it with energy This year Im doing it with defense contractorsFor example Goldman Sachs  did cut its buy rating from 83 to 73 yet it remained ,185,2023-10-04,1
72,"NextEra Energy Partners: Is It Always Darkest Before Dawn, Or Pitch Black?",Over the past seven trading days the NextEra Energy Partners  unit price has fallen off a cliffAnalysts on Seeking Alpha and from numerous mainstream investment research groups have been piling on the gloomIn this article we will take a look at whether or not the dramatic stock price decline is justified by fundamentals and then offer our verdict on whether investors should get out before the lights at NEP go pitch black or if NEP has a good chance ofYes the market was likely not happy about the rough halving of the distribution growth guidance at NEP though no one who knew 1 where interest rates were 2 where its equity price was trading even before it recently lost half of its market value and 3 the sheer magnitude of its upcoming wall of CEPF and debt maturities believed that NEP was likely to achieve its lofty 12 distribution CAGR guidanceMoreover negative market sentiment was likely spurred further by the slew of downgrades and steep price target reductions from previously bullish mainstream investment analysts However based on the analysts commentary in most cases many of these downgrades seemed to be at least partially driven by chasing market sentiment rather than truly driven by fundamental analysis of the company itselfThe real reason for the selloff in the stock price  in our view  was the vicious cycle created by two major factorsThe main factor preventing NEE from rolling up NEP at this point is that it wants to limit its direct exposure to renewables in order to keep regulated assets at a higher percentage and therefore make the credit ratings agencies happy Could they eventually decide that they are going to roll up NEP anyway Absolutely However NEE has made it clear that an independent and healthy NEP is important to them being able to achieve their longterm growth goals by being able to develop and dropdown renewable assets to NEP thereby generating attractive profits for NEE via its renewables development business while also preserving its regulatedrenewables balance to protect its credit rating and retain a relatively attractive cost of debt capital so they are likely going to do everything they can to revive NEPs growth story before resorting to a rollupAs a result our view is that NEE is likely going to give NEP at least a few more years to try to recover an attractive cost of capital If those efforts fail  especially if NEP faces a choice between a distribution cut or financial distress  NEE could very likely go down the path of reabsorbing NEP This is a scenario that likely means that the current unit price decline is a case of it being darkest before pitch blackThat said we believe that there is still a very viable path for NEP to return to prosperity and that it could very well be darkest before dawn Here is the mathAfter Q1 management was expecting a December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA of 24172617 million based on the following assumptionsSince then the announced potential sale of their STX pipeline and the cancelation of an expected dropdown from their parent NextEra Energy  overwhelmed their other growth initiatives to reduce their December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA by nearly 500 million to 19302130 millionOn the positive side corporate expenses have declined by an expected 10 million and the IDR fees of 157 million have been suspended for the foreseeable future reducing the hit to the December 31 2023 runrate NEPlevel adjusted EBITDA to 320 million or 19002100 million Moreover debt service expense has also been reduced substantially given that the STX debt will be taken out and the expected debt costs on the dropdown asset also do not apply so that improves the midpoint of estimated pretax CAFD by another 135 million PreTax Tax Credit deductions also declined by 135 million at the midpoint NonCash Income deductions declined by 5 million at the midpoint and Main,292,2023-10-06,6

83,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,562,2023-09-17,3

94,NextEra Energy Partners: 3 Reasons We Prefer Brookfield Renewable,The renewable energy bubble has burst While the march to increasing renewable energy sources has continued relentlessly the bubble of epic valuations has come to an end We documented this in real time with our  and With the froth out it is time to go hunting for bargains with the understanding that all bubbles always go far in the other directions That is what was once expensive and ridiculously priced will become cheap and ridiculously pricedSince we focus our work on finding quality income oriented investments we chose the two famous yield plays for todays topic Brookfield Renewable Partners LP  and its corporate nonLP version Brookfield Renewable Corporations BEP is a global energy powerhouse with 78 billion in assets in 20 countries around the worldThe contender to the crown is NextEra Energy Partners LP  The daughter company of NextEra Energy  has been a favorite amongst those who like a fastgrowing company that throws a solid distribution their way Both stocks have been on our radar as the renewable energy bubble burst took placeWe go over three reasons why we prefer BEP to NEP for those looking to add a little renewable energy exposure at these beaten down levelsThere is a time to take risk and there is a time to put caution first For most of the past decade it really did not matter whether you had tripleA credit or were rated in the last rungs of junk You got access to the credit markets But we have moved beyond that ZIRP Zero Interest Rate Policy era and we will likely differentiate in the months ahead between higher and lower quality ratings In fact the signs are in place that we are set up for some radical widening of spreads in the bottom tiers of the credit poolBEP is rated BBB by SP NEP on the other hand is at BB That single B differentiator actually puts these ratings a good distance apart with BB and BBB intervening BEP also has a far greater weighted average debt maturity We like having BEP in our portfolio here and would stay away from lower rated issuers except in very select casesNEP has backed itself into a corner with promises of high distribution growth While the ZIRP allowed this to flourish we think the 1215 distribution growth is simply not possible in todays world NEP stuck to its tag line despite a first half of 2023 that was significantly weaker than expected Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available For Distribution ie CAFD both coming in under 2022 levels That is going to make those lofty growth rates difficultBut we think the time is drawing closer when NEP resets the distribution growth expectations for the 20242027 timeframe That will likely create some panic in the stock In addition the payout ratio for NEP is likely to cross 100 in 20232024 timeframe further pressuring the stockBEP on the other hand has no such high and mighty promises to back up It has targeted a 5 to 9 growthBased on funds from operations expected for 2024 the payout ratio will be about 73 if BEP does hike by another 5 This is more in line with setting the right expectations for this financial climateWind and solar projects are great for expansion but they are not our top choice for stable base load generation NEP is focused on wind and solar while BEP gets half of its electricity generation from very high quality hydro assetsUnlike wind and solar you really cannot create new hydroelectricity assets at will We think these will hold substantial value in the long run and offer a better appreciation potential versus wind and solarIf you want to chase the 1215 distribution growth dream we really cannot stop you But we think that distribution growth is not going to come If 1215 growth rates alongside paying out every last cent of CAFD as distributions was easy to do even the parent NextEra Energy  would be doing itBEP is the better and safer option and this is the first time since we started its coverage that we are actually slappin,66,2023-09-15,7

103,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,562,2023-09-17,3

114,NextEra Energy Partners: 3 Reasons We Prefer Brookfield Renewable,The renewable energy bubble has burst While the march to increasing renewable energy sources has continued relentlessly the bubble of epic valuations has come to an end We documented this in real time with our  and With the froth out it is time to go hunting for bargains with the understanding that all bubbles always go far in the other directions That is what was once expensive and ridiculously priced will become cheap and ridiculously pricedSince we focus our work on finding quality income oriented investments we chose the two famous yield plays for todays topic Brookfield Renewable Partners LP  and its corporate nonLP version Brookfield Renewable Corporations BEP is a global energy powerhouse with 78 billion in assets in 20 countries around the worldThe contender to the crown is NextEra Energy Partners LP  The daughter company of NextEra Energy  has been a favorite amongst those who like a fastgrowing company that throws a solid distribution their way Both stocks have been on our radar as the renewable energy bubble burst took placeWe go over three reasons why we prefer BEP to NEP for those looking to add a little renewable energy exposure at these beaten down levelsThere is a time to take risk and there is a time to put caution first For most of the past decade it really did not matter whether you had tripleA credit or were rated in the last rungs of junk You got access to the credit markets But we have moved beyond that ZIRP Zero Interest Rate Policy era and we will likely differentiate in the months ahead between higher and lower quality ratings In fact the signs are in place that we are set up for some radical widening of spreads in the bottom tiers of the credit poolBEP is rated BBB by SP NEP on the other hand is at BB That single B differentiator actually puts these ratings a good distance apart with BB and BBB intervening BEP also has a far greater weighted average debt maturity We like having BEP in our portfolio here and would stay away from lower rated issuers except in very select casesNEP has backed itself into a corner with promises of high distribution growth While the ZIRP allowed this to flourish we think the 1215 distribution growth is simply not possible in todays world NEP stuck to its tag line despite a first half of 2023 that was significantly weaker than expected Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available For Distribution ie CAFD both coming in under 2022 levels That is going to make those lofty growth rates difficultBut we think the time is drawing closer when NEP resets the distribution growth expectations for the 20242027 timeframe That will likely create some panic in the stock In addition the payout ratio for NEP is likely to cross 100 in 20232024 timeframe further pressuring the stockBEP on the other hand has no such high and mighty promises to back up It has targeted a 5 to 9 growthBased on funds from operations expected for 2024 the payout ratio will be about 73 if BEP does hike by another 5 This is more in line with setting the right expectations for this financial climateWind and solar projects are great for expansion but they are not our top choice for stable base load generation NEP is focused on wind and solar while BEP gets half of its electricity generation from very high quality hydro assetsUnlike wind and solar you really cannot create new hydroelectricity assets at will We think these will hold substantial value in the long run and offer a better appreciation potential versus wind and solarIf you want to chase the 1215 distribution growth dream we really cannot stop you But we think that distribution growth is not going to come If 1215 growth rates alongside paying out every last cent of CAFD as distributions was easy to do even the parent NextEra Energy  would be doing itBEP is the better and safer option and this is the first time since we started its coverage that we are actually slappin,66,2023-09-15,7

120,NextEra Energy Partners Stock: The 5 Stages Of Grief,On our last coverage of NextEra Energy Partners LP  we focused on the fact that growth plans were completely out of touch with reality and a downgrade was coming soonSource While we would love to take full credit for the bloodbath that followed we were a bit surprised at the magnitude of the moveA 40 rewrite obviously changes things We give our latest thoughts belowThe announcement did not seem too badSource NEP emphasis oursGrowth rate was cut in half but honestly nobody who has been following the renewable space massive margin compression or looking at financing conditions was buying the 12 growth story So one might have expected a celebration of sorts After all the stock already was down by about half from its 2021 peak before this announcementSo what we think is happening is that the market is not even buying those growth rate assumptions The reason is that the distribution growth is tied to debt and unit countWithout growing either distribution growth of any variety will be impossible After all NEP is paying most or all of its CAFD back as distributions Sure most contracts have inflation escalators so theres some natural growth from that But it wont be enough to counteract the debt reset You have 34 billion coming due in the next 4 years at a weighted average of about 26That needs to reset to over 75 in todays market So roughly you would be jumping up 5 on 35 billion or about 175 million annually So what does that mean for the company The company did 103 of CAFD for Q22023 which was 8 below Q22023 Even this was boosted by lower debt principal payments lower cash interest payments and lower maintenance capex If you take away 175 million from higher rates from that you can kiss your growth and your current distribution goodbye Even assuming a baseline runrate growth from current operations of about 10 total over the next four years your CAFD per unit falls below the distribution rate projected for Q42023 With these LP setups we have seen the tango and the drama and they follow a predictable arc Though each time it happens investors act surprisedThe first stage is coming to grips with the end of the growth story This seems like a benign event but marks the limits to what the market will tolerate in a company that sends all distributions back to investors and then keeps tapping the market for equity and debt issuance This is when the company goes from a regular dividend payer to a high yield as the stock falls a lot We have this happen for NEP alreadyWoohoo doubledigit yieldThe second stage is investors piling in just for the income Hey no growth is not a problem as long as the distribution can be maintained right We can sympathize but investors tend to forget two important facts The first is that these companies require capital spending beyond what they classify as maintenance capex to actually maintain the distribution Most of these assets have a limited life and maintenance capex alone is not enough to even sustain the distribution in the long run The second is that their general partner did not throw them out there to throw a steady distribution back It was designed as a dropdown vehicle and a way to access capital without destroying their own credit ratings They have zero use for a regular distribution back to them when theres no growthSo that leads to the third stage which is a distribution cut Its blamed on capital markets asset specific problems specific events and occasionally the Easter Bunny The company may even say they are cutting to fund growth which is about the silliest thing they can say but thats where this ultimately goes In the case of NEP well you have the capital market clause already in play The numbers dont lie One point we want to make is that the debt profile shown earlier in the article is from December 31 2022 By June 30 2023 this was another 12 billion higherOf course the cut is no,260,2023-09-29,7

123,NextEra Energy Partners Makes For A Great Prospect Following Its Plunge,The past few days have not been particularly pleasant for shareholders of renewable energy company   Over the span of only two trading days shares of the enterprise dropped 349 with the market reacting inBack in May of this year the management team at NextEra Energy Partners  that the company would be going through a significant change aimed at simplifying the firms operational structure and moving the company in the direction of being a pureplay investment in the renewable energy market I wont spend too much time on this specifically simply because it is old news But it is relevant to the current conversation So a bit of discussion is warrantedAt present NextEra Energy Partners owns two primary sets of assets Some of these assets are natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure But these assets account for only a small portion of the companys revenue In fact in the  of the 2023 fiscal year the enterprise derived only 174 of its sales from these particular assets The rest of its revenue came from its ownership interests in various renewable energy assets Wind projects comprise the bulk of its production capacity In the most recent quarter for which data is available the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year its wind assets were responsible for the production of 7406MW of power Thats up 366 compared to the 5420MW produced the same time last year Solar is also another category that management is focused on In fact during the second quarter of this year alone the company made acquisitions totaling both wind and solar projects amounting to 690MW It does engage in some battery storage activities as well but that represents only a small portion of the firms focusThe plan that management announced earlier this year calls for it to over the next couple of years sell off its pipeline assets Using those proceeds the company wants to both simplify its corporate structure by buying out certain convertible equity portfolio financings and using any excess proceeds from said asset sales to fuel further growth in the renewable energy space At the end of the day managements goal is to turn NextEra Energy Partners into a pureplay renewable energy providerWhen management made this announcement they claimed that it was the companys goal to continue prioritizing distributions for the common shareholders And they believed that they could continue to grow the limited partner distributions per unit at a rate of between 12 and 15 per annum for the next few years In fact the company even extends this out to 2026 If the firm had been able to achieve this kind of target it would take distributions per unit from 325 last year to between 511 and 568 per unit in 2026 However the picture has since changed drasticallyOn September 27th management issued a  in which it said that the company was revising down its growth expectations for the next few years Instead of targeting distribution per unit growth of between 12 and 15 per annum they are now targeting growth of between 5 and 8 per annum The ultimate  is to hit around 6 which is in the lower half of the range This marks a drastic departure from the companys initial plan In the chart below you can see how the low high and target projections for distribution growth impact the total distribution per share of the company on an annual basis over the next few years You can also see that stacked up against the  that is also shown in the image above Even in the most optimistic case by 2026 we are looking at a distribution disparity of at least 101 per share That adds up and even with the current share count of the company which will actually increase to an extra 93 million a year that wont be paid out to shareholders But when you factor in future share issuances that disparity will likely be far higherManagements announcement likely has a lot to do with how the economy is and the opportunities that exist out,82,2023-10-01,6

126,Clean Energy Fuels: A Total Mixed Bag,Clean Energy Fuels Corp  comes with an interesting premise and promise to produce renewable clean energy from byproduct of cows in shape of RNG renewable natural gas in order to transform the global transportation industry The managements promises soundIn recent years the company was able to show some growth in its production and delivery numbers as well as revenues but none of that converted into profits and investors grew increasingly frustrated with lack of profits Even though the stock is up 41 in the last 3 years its been in a downtrend during most of this time after an initial rally of more than 500The company received large investments totaling 800 million from TotalEnergies  and BP  which made the former the largest shareholder in CLNE The company seems to have put this money into work by building a network of 580 fuel stations a large distribution network and RNG production sites These investments made the company a global leader in RNG fuel market for transportation The company was able to increase its annual sales from 13 million GGEs gasoline gallon equivalents to 198 million GGEs between 2013 and 2023 The company currently sells about half of RNG used for transportation fuel in the US These seem like good developments and the company has been making progress in reaching its long term goals but these have also been very costly for the company as it has posted some large lossesThe companys biggest selling point is its positive impact on the environment rather than making a profit and this also appears to be its first priority I respect the companys decision to emphasize its environmental impact over profits but at the same time Id like to see some profits as an investor before putting my money into it In the below chart you will see the environmental impact of different types of fuels in shape of carbon emission and as you can see the companys two products seem to have the lowest carbon emission as compared to alternatives Notice that RNG produced from manure actually has a negative carbon emission because it eliminates methane from the environment that normally would have been harmful so its net impact is actually positiveMeanwhile the company is facing a pretty big opportunity Early next year one of the biggest truck engine producers in the world Cummins  is  its new generation of 15L engine platforms that will be used by new generation semi trucks The platform includes hydrogen diesel and biogas options There are already some big customers lining up for the RNG version of these engines including Knight Transportation  which is one of the largest trucking companies in the country The company already  Cummins new generation X15N natural gas engine using RNG fuels from CLNE and reportedly has been happy with the results In addition several other companies such as Amazon  UPS  and Waste Management  are already using CLNEs natural gas in their fleets and shown interest in next generation RNG trucks These companies all have ambitious goals to reduce their carbon prints significantly in the next 2030 years As a matter of fact CLNE has a number of fuel stations that are specifically dedicated to Amazon trucks and the company wants to build more of those in partnership with AmazonIf the demand increases in a significant way the companys current network of 590 fuel stations will not be sufficient and it will need to build more stations along with more production plants Up until recently the company was getting virtually all of its cow byproducts from third party dairy producers but it also made some investments and took steps to have its own production sites which may help margins in the long term but will require a lot of initial investmentIn the long term the company sees itself supporting transportation industry in multiple shapes and forms Currently its mainly producing RNG which it distributes to its customers from fuel stations but in the future ther,20,2023-10-25,6

135,NextEra Energy Partners' Growth Has Been Stalled By Higher Rates: Time To Move On,From its listing in 2014 until the last year NextEra Energy Partners  was one of the great success stories within the renewable energy industry Through the end of 2022 NEP generated total returns of more than 280 wellI  on NEP back in May with a buy rating after management announced that NEE would suspend IDR payments and that the company was pursuing a sale of its pipeline assets in order to prevent any needed equity raises through the end of next year This was a positive development in my opinion as it eliminated an equity overhangHowever since I last published the US 10 year treasury yield has risen 12 from 351 to 471 As this sell off began to gain steam in August we discussed selling NEP in my investing group a few months ago The increaseDue to these circumstances I am now moving to the equivalent of a hold rating as the stock is just a couple of dollars above my bear case On September 27 NextEra Energy Partners  that it was revising its distribution growth rate expectations from 12 to 15 per annum to 5 to 8 Since the announcement the stock has subsequently fallen 40 and now sits below its 2014 IPO price at approximately 24 at the time of writingThe decline in the stock price has resulted in a spike in its dividend yield to 144 While this level of yield may seem enticing even in an environment with 5 money market yields we still believe the stock should be avoided as the companys leverage refinancing risk and payout ratios all remain far too riskyNextEra Energy Partners decision to cut its growth guidance was a necessary step towards ensuring the companys longterm viability Maintaining the initial 12 to 15 growth target would have required the company to pursue an additional acquisition from NextEra Energy  this quarterHowever the decline in the stock price earlier this year coupled with rising interest rates rendered the financing of such an acquisition as valueeroding By adjusting the growth rate NEP can now sidestep the need to raise external equity through the end of 2027The challenging fundraising environment is pressuring management to pivot towards organic growth projects instead of dealsdropdowns from NEE Moving forward the company suggests that they will focus mostly on repowering their wind assets which entails upgrading existing wind turbines with newer and more efficient technology to boost energy outputThe decision to lower growth guidance is largely attributable to higher interest rates and made worse by a low stock price Traditionally NEP has grown via acquiring 1 to 2 billion of assets annually from the renewable development arm of NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Resources NEER This highlights the capitalintensive nature of NEPs growth model It is rare to find businesses that can generate longterm sustainable returns for shareholders when they are capitalintensive have a high distribution payout ratio and heavily rely on external financing NEP pulled it off for years but the rapid rise in interest rates has essentially broken this modelThe trajectory of interest rates might be a topic of debate and a precipitous drop in rates could save the stock But theres no doubt that NEP finds itself in a precarious position in a higher for longer interest rate environmentBeyond the escalating costs to finance future growth the company is facing several nearterm bond maturities These bonds are likely to be refinanced at significantly higher coupon rates especially the low rate converts potentially adding around 100 million in interest expense cumulatively between 2024 and 2027 This additional financial burden could further strain NEPs ability to meet even its new distribution growth targetsIncorporating the revised assumptions into our model suggests that CAFD per share will grow modestly at around 48 from 2023 to 2027 That is lower than the companys dividend growth guidance of 58 and poses a problemThe combination ,33,2023-10-03,6

140,NextEra Energy Partners Stock: The 5 Stages Of Grief,On our last coverage of NextEra Energy Partners LP  we focused on the fact that growth plans were completely out of touch with reality and a downgrade was coming soonSource While we would love to take full credit for the bloodbath that followed we were a bit surprised at the magnitude of the moveA 40 rewrite obviously changes things We give our latest thoughts belowThe announcement did not seem too badSource NEP emphasis oursGrowth rate was cut in half but honestly nobody who has been following the renewable space massive margin compression or looking at financing conditions was buying the 12 growth story So one might have expected a celebration of sorts After all the stock already was down by about half from its 2021 peak before this announcementSo what we think is happening is that the market is not even buying those growth rate assumptions The reason is that the distribution growth is tied to debt and unit countWithout growing either distribution growth of any variety will be impossible After all NEP is paying most or all of its CAFD back as distributions Sure most contracts have inflation escalators so theres some natural growth from that But it wont be enough to counteract the debt reset You have 34 billion coming due in the next 4 years at a weighted average of about 26That needs to reset to over 75 in todays market So roughly you would be jumping up 5 on 35 billion or about 175 million annually So what does that mean for the company The company did 103 of CAFD for Q22023 which was 8 below Q22023 Even this was boosted by lower debt principal payments lower cash interest payments and lower maintenance capex If you take away 175 million from higher rates from that you can kiss your growth and your current distribution goodbye Even assuming a baseline runrate growth from current operations of about 10 total over the next four years your CAFD per unit falls below the distribution rate projected for Q42023 With these LP setups we have seen the tango and the drama and they follow a predictable arc Though each time it happens investors act surprisedThe first stage is coming to grips with the end of the growth story This seems like a benign event but marks the limits to what the market will tolerate in a company that sends all distributions back to investors and then keeps tapping the market for equity and debt issuance This is when the company goes from a regular dividend payer to a high yield as the stock falls a lot We have this happen for NEP alreadyWoohoo doubledigit yieldThe second stage is investors piling in just for the income Hey no growth is not a problem as long as the distribution can be maintained right We can sympathize but investors tend to forget two important facts The first is that these companies require capital spending beyond what they classify as maintenance capex to actually maintain the distribution Most of these assets have a limited life and maintenance capex alone is not enough to even sustain the distribution in the long run The second is that their general partner did not throw them out there to throw a steady distribution back It was designed as a dropdown vehicle and a way to access capital without destroying their own credit ratings They have zero use for a regular distribution back to them when theres no growthSo that leads to the third stage which is a distribution cut Its blamed on capital markets asset specific problems specific events and occasionally the Easter Bunny The company may even say they are cutting to fund growth which is about the silliest thing they can say but thats where this ultimately goes In the case of NEP well you have the capital market clause already in play The numbers dont lie One point we want to make is that the debt profile shown earlier in the article is from December 31 2022 By June 30 2023 this was another 12 billion higherOf course the cut is no,260,2023-09-29,6

142,A High-Yield Investor's Dream: Brookfield Renewable Partners' 6.4% Yield,Im extremely bullish on oil and gas which is why I have been buying drillers rather aggressively since 2020 One of the reasons Im so bullish is the spending shift from fossil fuels to renewables which has caused the fossil fuel industryBefore the pandemic spending on clean energy and fossil fuels was roughly the same Now renewable spending is much higherGreen debt issuance alone is now higher than oil gas and coalrelated financingAccording to the June 2023 Renewable Energy Market  from the International Energy Agency renewable power capacity is projected to witness a significant increase this year with a 33 jump driven by robust policy support rising fossil fuel prices and energy security concernsTheGlobal renewable capacity additions are set to skyrocket by a historic 107 GW marking the largest absolute increase ever to surpass 440 GW in 2023This dynamic expansion is unfolding across major global markets with Europe the United States and India experiencing significant increases due to new policy measuresMeanwhile China is solidifying its position as the leader accounting for nearly 55 of global renewable power capacity additions in 2023 and 2024Having said that a lot of renewable companies are not in a good spotBoth wind and solar stocks have massively underperformed the market and fossil fuel stocks over the past three years pressured by higher inflation and elevated rates that make financing expensive renewables a lot less attractiveOne victim in this industry is  which has given up almost all of its postpandemic gains excluding dividendsThe good news is that this has made the riskreward much more attractiveBEP now yields 64 It has a toptier balance sheet and a portfolio that makes it a cornerstone of the current energy transitionAlthough I prefer to hold fossil fuel companies adding highquality renewables makes sense for welldiversified incomefocused portfoliosEven better I would make the case that BEP is a highyielding stock that comes with income growth The company has strong operating cash flow growth and a track record of consistent dividend growthIn this article well discuss all of this and moreSo lets get to itWhen it comes to renewables I do not invest in smaller startups or companies that have big plans but no proven track record That may limit my potential upside but it also limits my risksWith that in mind Brookfield Renewable Partners operates a leading publicly traded platform globally focused on renewable energy and solutions for decarbonizationThe companys extensive portfolio includes hydroelectric wind solar distributed energy and sustainable solutions across multiple continentsAs the overview above shows the company has an operational installed base of more than 31000 megawatts It has more than 130000 megawatts in developmentMost of this is located in North America and Europe with a focus on utility solarInvestors have the option to access this portfolio through Brookfield Renewable Partners a limited partnership based in Bermuda or Brookfield Renewable Corporation  a Canadian corporationEssentially BEPC was established to offer investors increased flexibility in accessing BEPs welldiversified global portfolio of highquality renewable power assetsThe Class A shares of BEPC are designed to deliver an economic return equivalent to BEP units within a conventional corporate structure Each BEPC Class A share corresponds to the same distribution as a BEP unit and is exchangeable for one BEP unitSo technically speaking BEP shareholders are called unitholders Its dividends are called distributions However in this article I may use both as this makes it less confusing for a lot of people  although it may not be correctHaving said that because of its size BEP is a great way to get exposure to renewables without having to bet on small playersDuring its 2Q23 earnings call the company outlined its substantial progr,11,2023-10-16,6

161,NextEra Energy Partners: Outlook May Be Cut But Some Value Is Still Present,NextEra Energy Partners LP  is a pretty wellcovered company that is right now yielding over 15 with the dividend For investors that seek a stable play in the energy sector NEP might look decent on the surface butNEP specializes in the acquisition ownership and management of contracted clean energy projects throughout the United States The company boasts a diverse portfolio of renewable generation assets encompassing wind solar and battery storage projects in addition to holding contracted natural gas pipeline assets NEP enjoys a strategic advantage by actively  in the burgeoning renewable energy market in Florida This state is currently at the forefront of renewable energy growth in the United States making it a prime location for NEP to capitalize on the increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy solutionsInvestments into the renewable space are only accelerating and with NEP you are getting a significant amount of exposure to this trend But with the natural gas assets the company has it provides a strong base of earnings to grow fromInvestments have continued for the company and they now have resulted in over 23 billion of total assets on the balance sheet The vast majority of this is in gross property plant and equipment for the business around 18 billion to be exact With the heavy investments going into the business it hasnt necessarily translated into a stronger ROAThe ROA is right now slightly below the historical levels and the ROC has fallen a decent bit as well If this trend continues I think the poor sentiment on the share price will continue The company got caught up in the hype around renewables and green energy in 2021 and has since fallen quite a lotOn the 5year chart the company is quite a lot lower than 5 years ago a worrisome trend in my opinion Sure they have a lot of growth prospects going forward as renewables continue making up a larger sum of the energy generation but increasing margins and returns is necessary to drive the share price higher Estimates vary quite a lot as its more or less an estimate of how the electricity costs are going to develop As the chart below shows the net income of NEP is following the electricity prices very wellGoing into a peer comparison NEP continues to be one of the companies exhibiting a high premium right now The pe jumped up heavily in July following the  the company had on the earnings The EPS for the quarter ended at 053 a miss of 023 from the estimates This sent the company up high in terms of valuation and has been a supporting factor for the continued downtrend over the last 12 monthsWe are getting the  report from NEP very soon I think that given the bleak  that NEP has provided so far and the decision to not proceed with some asset dropdowns Current estimates are for Q3 to provide EPS of 046 and I think if we see a significant miss on this the share price will see even lower levels The outlook for distribution per unit was revised down to 5  6 annually and if 2023 proves to go below this it could be another shortterm headwind for the share price As for what I think Q3 will result in I am betting on a slight beat on both the top and bottom which could bring some shortterm relief I dont expect any significant positive news but perhaps some more necessary details on the shortterm trend of demand for the businessOver the last decade the dividend yield for the company has risen quite a lot following the decrease in the share price over the last 12 months With a yield of nearly 16 on an FWD basis the company might look appealing The dividends being paid out have landed at 697 million in the last 12 months and in comparison to the EBITDA of 682 million I find this quite worryingSupporting the dividend seems to be more and more debt and issuance of shares The two have gone up steadily over the last 5 years as NEP grapples with maintaining a satisfying yield for investors I think that the,12,2023-10-20,7

164,Energy Transfer: Potential Energy Trade Of The Decade,Energy Transfer  has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the commodities bull run of 2022 as its units outperformed the SP 500 while the successful performance of its business thanks to the increase of energy pricesEnergy Transfer units appreciated by 10 since my latest  on the company was published in December and there are reasons to believe thatAt the same time despite the price weakness Energy Transfers adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was 312 billion just slightly below the 323 billion from a year ago which indicates that the business has been able to successfully adapt to the new environment without suffering significant losses Thanks to this Energy Transfer was able to  155 billion in cash distribution to its unit holders in Q2 aloneGoing forward there are even more reasons for optimism First of all the overall improvement of the American  in recent quarters indicates that a hard landing that couldve destroyed the demand for natural gas even more is no longer in play This should help Energy Transfer to continue to increase its volumes as the market normalizesWhats more is that Russian natural gas is not returning en masse to the international markets which is good news for nonRussian natural gas producers and all the other businesses from the industry By the end of 2022 Russian gas supplies  for less than 13 of supplies to the European Union down from 41 in 2021 This was possible thanks to the increase in supplies of American LNG to the old continent which now provides 50 of the European LNG demandAdd to all of this the fact that Russia  be able to redirect its natural gas supplies to Asia in the same volumes in the following decades and it becomes obvious that the supply would remain tight while the demand is likely to increase thanks to the projected  of the global economy This is one of the main reasons why the IEA  that Asian spot LNG and TTF prices are expected to remain above their historic averages this year Thats why there are reasons to believe that Energy Transfer volumes would continue to increase and set new records as a combination of domestic and global developments would keep the natural gas flowing through its pipelinesConsidering all of this it seems that at this stage theres nothing not to like about Energy Transfer At the current price Energy Transfer  an attractive forward yield of over 9 and it expects its adjusted EBITDA for FY23 to range between131 billion and 134 billion On top of that back in December I noted that its units represent an upside of 40 Considering that they already appreciated by 10 since that time theres still around 30 upside left This view is shared by the street as well as the current  price target for Energy Transfer is 1728 per unitI see two major risks that could undermine the bullish thesis The first risk would be the inability of Energy Transfer to construct the Lake Charles export LNG facility and miss on global opportunities that the market offers So far the company signed deals to supply 79 million metric tons of natural gas per year to clients primarily from Asia but it still hasnt reached a final investment decision on whether the construct the facility in the first placeEarlier this week the management  the US Department of Energy to give the company a new export license for the facility as it wont be able to complete the project under the current license with a deadline in 2025 Considering that the request to extend the current license failed earlier his year and theres no guarantee that the new licensee would be issued at a time when others are already finishing the building of their export LNG facilities theres a risk that Energy Transfer would miss the ability to monetize global opportunitiesAnother risk to Energy Transfers bullish thesis is the return of Russian natural gas to international markets en masse which would lead to an extended period of price weakness in the natural gas market,460,2023-08-25,7

166,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time,1306,2023-08-14,6

184,Energy Transfer: Potential Energy Trade Of The Decade,Energy Transfer  has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the commodities bull run of 2022 as its units outperformed the SP 500 while the successful performance of its business thanks to the increase of energy pricesEnergy Transfer units appreciated by 10 since my latest  on the company was published in December and there are reasons to believe thatAt the same time despite the price weakness Energy Transfers adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was 312 billion just slightly below the 323 billion from a year ago which indicates that the business has been able to successfully adapt to the new environment without suffering significant losses Thanks to this Energy Transfer was able to  155 billion in cash distribution to its unit holders in Q2 aloneGoing forward there are even more reasons for optimism First of all the overall improvement of the American  in recent quarters indicates that a hard landing that couldve destroyed the demand for natural gas even more is no longer in play This should help Energy Transfer to continue to increase its volumes as the market normalizesWhats more is that Russian natural gas is not returning en masse to the international markets which is good news for nonRussian natural gas producers and all the other businesses from the industry By the end of 2022 Russian gas supplies  for less than 13 of supplies to the European Union down from 41 in 2021 This was possible thanks to the increase in supplies of American LNG to the old continent which now provides 50 of the European LNG demandAdd to all of this the fact that Russia  be able to redirect its natural gas supplies to Asia in the same volumes in the following decades and it becomes obvious that the supply would remain tight while the demand is likely to increase thanks to the projected  of the global economy This is one of the main reasons why the IEA  that Asian spot LNG and TTF prices are expected to remain above their historic averages this year Thats why there are reasons to believe that Energy Transfer volumes would continue to increase and set new records as a combination of domestic and global developments would keep the natural gas flowing through its pipelinesConsidering all of this it seems that at this stage theres nothing not to like about Energy Transfer At the current price Energy Transfer  an attractive forward yield of over 9 and it expects its adjusted EBITDA for FY23 to range between131 billion and 134 billion On top of that back in December I noted that its units represent an upside of 40 Considering that they already appreciated by 10 since that time theres still around 30 upside left This view is shared by the street as well as the current  price target for Energy Transfer is 1728 per unitI see two major risks that could undermine the bullish thesis The first risk would be the inability of Energy Transfer to construct the Lake Charles export LNG facility and miss on global opportunities that the market offers So far the company signed deals to supply 79 million metric tons of natural gas per year to clients primarily from Asia but it still hasnt reached a final investment decision on whether the construct the facility in the first placeEarlier this week the management  the US Department of Energy to give the company a new export license for the facility as it wont be able to complete the project under the current license with a deadline in 2025 Considering that the request to extend the current license failed earlier his year and theres no guarantee that the new licensee would be issued at a time when others are already finishing the building of their export LNG facilities theres a risk that Energy Transfer would miss the ability to monetize global opportunitiesAnother risk to Energy Transfers bullish thesis is the return of Russian natural gas to international markets en masse which would lead to an extended period of price weakness in the natural gas market,460,2023-08-25,6

193,Tesla Q3 Earnings Watch: All Eyes On Energy Margins,  has long portrayed itself as more than a car company by showcasing its various other business lines especially its Energy Generation  Storage vertical known as Tesla Energy As I CEO Elon Musk has for years promised big things from Teslas energy segment In 2019  that Tesla Energy would soon be growing far more rapidly than its automotive businessMusk doubled down on this prediction less than a year later  that Tesla Energy would eventually eclipse its automotive segment altogetherIn the years since the reality has proven far more prosaic While Teslas energy business remains Teslas only nonEV business segment of any meaningful size its growth has fallen far short of expectations Even so Tesla Energy showed remarkable margin improvement last quarter even as Teslas automotive segment experienced considerable margin compression That improvement and whether it can be sustained is worth examining ahead of the companys next earnings announcement on Oct 18Almost since its inception the energy generation side of Teslas Energy Generation  Storage business has been something of a problem child for the company Teslas solar division started out as one of many largely undifferentiated players in a crowded solar panel installation market The company launched the Tesla Energy brand in 2015 solar deployments that year totaled 750 megawatts MW However it was not until the following year that the epic saga of Teslas foray into solar truly beganIn October 2016 Tesla announced  a solar panel installer As luck would have it the chairman of SolarCitys board at the time was none other than Elon Musk The company which was run by a pair of brothers who also happened to be Musks cousins had found itself in a serious financial pickle At the heart of SolarCitys woes was an inability to service the massive debt load it had accumulated in its ultimately quixotic effort to sustain topline growth Teslas buyout offer was a lifeline for a company rapidly approaching insolvency Musk touted the tieup as a way for Tesla to leapfrog the competition to become the nations top solar energy player He also claimed it would help Tesla roll out its Solar Roof a brand new product that was he said already ready for commercial launchAs things turned out the planned expansion of Teslas solar business never materialized In fact the company saw a steep decline in solar deployments The 846 MW it deployed in 2016 was a new record one which stands to this day Deployments fell 383 in 2017 and another 376 in 2018 2019 marked the nadir with solar deployments of just 173 MW during the entire year a 47 drop from the year before and down fully 80 from 2016During the next couple of years Teslas diminished solar business showed some signs of bouncing back from the bottom In 2020 solar deployments actually rose albeit only modestly with fullyear deployments rising 185 to 205 MW While growth accelerated in 2021 seeing a 68 jump in deployments to 345 MW the positive momentum soon began to dissipate Tesla managed 348 MW in solar deployments eking out a yearoveryear increase of less than 1This year solar deployments are once again treading water Tesla deployed 133 MW in the first half of 2023 136 less than it managed during the same period last year putting Tesla on track for yet another down year In its  Tesla stated that it was only able to deploy only 66 MW during the quarter predominantly due to a high interest rate environment that is causing postponement of solar purchasing industrywideStagnant deployment numbers are not the only sour note for Teslas solar business Its bet on the Solar Roof has also largely failed to pay off Tesla had promised 1000 installations per week in 2019 As of March 2023 Tesla had managed The storage side of the Energy Generation  Storage story is somewhat happier at least by comparison Tesla first announced plans to use its battery techno,81,2023-10-17,7

211,Is Devon Energy The Next Target Of An Energy Mega-Merger?,The WSJ reported yesterday that Exxon Mobil  is in the late stages of finalizing a deal to purchase Pioneer Natural Resources  in a deal worth roughly 60 billion A direct consequence of last years boomThe potential ExxonPioneer deal is the latest in an emerging mergers and acquisitions boom in the oil and gas upstream sector Enverus Intelligence released a  in July of this year stating MA activity in the oil and gas upstream sector totaled 24 billion in the second quarter of 2023 tripling from 8 billion in theThe natural question then is which stock can investors look to next in the oil and gas MA boom In this article we will take a look at a stock that has been gaining attention from investors perhaps attributable to the fact that it is one of the worstperforming largecap oil  gas stocks of the year Devon Energy Corporation With a market cap of 28 billion Devon Energy is the sixth largest publicly listed oil  gas exploration company in the United States and the worstperforming of the largecap stocks in its industryPriced at 43 per share DVN stock is currently at 52week lows down a massive 45 from its 52week high down 28 YTD and threatening to make new lows In comparison the iShares Oil  Gas Exploration ETF  is down just 195 YTD and down 14 from its 52week highDoes this massive underperformance from DVN present a major opportunity for investors given the backdrop of an MA boom or signal a major red flagThe market perhaps leans towards the latter Following the WSJ report of Exxons potential takeover of Pioneer the reaction across the remainder of the industry remains muted While as of writing Pioneer stock is up approximately 10 on the news of its pending acquisition none of its peers have managed to gain more than 100 basis points Devon Energy itself is up a mere 06 on the news The markets response may change in the coming days as it fully digests the news but for now this signal or lack thereof suggests that the market doesnt have much faith in another industry megamerger in the immediate futureIn favor of a Devon Energy acquisition it is perhaps the cheapest stock in the industry boasting a forward PE ratio of just 64 in comparison to Pioneers forward PE ratio of 90 based on its price prior to the acquisition announcementPutting aside any potential acquisition for a moment Devon Energy may be worth considering on a pure valuation basis Whether or not Devon Energy is a good value investment hinges largely on whether oil prices will remain elevated  as recently as October 3rd higher oil prices are here to stay attributable to the recent and extended period of underinvestment supply cuts and relentless demand growthInvestors may also be attracted to Devon Energys welldefined dividend strategy to share a substantial portion of its free cash flow with its investors A couple of years ago the oil company introduced a unique dividend framework consisting of a fixed and variable dividend It pays a flat quarterly dividend that it aims to maintain even during periods of lower oil prices Additionally it distributes up to fifty percent of its remaining free cash as variable dividends In the calendar years 2021 and 2022 Devon Energy paid investors dividends totaling 197 and 517 respectively Yields of 46 and 12 based on the current approximate share price of 43 In 2023 YTD Devon has paid investors total dividends of 210 or a 651 annualized yieldThe idea that Devon Energy could be the target of an acquisition is also supported by the geographic location of the companys assets The Enverus Intelligence report cited earlier states that MA activity is largely focused on operations and assets located in the Permian Basin According to Devon Energys The Delaware Basin is the second largest component of the larger Permian Basin and according to  accounts for 64 of the companys combined production volumes across Oil Natural Ga,51,2023-10-07,0

213,Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nationThis has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently however As regular readers may recall we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices although that is almost certainly a factor As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience Investors are no longer willing to wait years or decades to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios In todays highrate environment their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now Energy Transfer currently boasts an 884 yield so it certainly meets this requirement In fact this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the SP 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves however Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense todayAs stated in the introduction Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines storage facilities natural gas liquids fractionators natural gas processing plants and terminals The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant Overall its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific CoastThis is not especially surprising as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state As a result there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a resultAs mentioned earlier it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfers units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfers unit price since August 3 2023We can obviously see a correlation here as the two charts move almost in lockstep However Energy Transfers cash flows have very little to do with oil prices As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90 of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA a proxy for pretax cash flow will come from these volumebased contractsThus the companys financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers not their value As such its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the companys adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years In particular the average price of West Texas Intermediate was 3968 per barrel in 2020 6817 per barrel in 2021 and 9453 per barrel in 2022 The yeartodate average for 2023 is 7790 per barrel and Energy Transfers annualized adjusted EBITDA is 13110 billion Thus we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the companys adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believeWith that said there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do After all there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices However as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Prof,27,2023-10-20,0

231,Is Devon Energy The Next Target Of An Energy Mega-Merger?,The WSJ reported yesterday that Exxon Mobil  is in the late stages of finalizing a deal to purchase Pioneer Natural Resources  in a deal worth roughly 60 billion A direct consequence of last years boomThe potential ExxonPioneer deal is the latest in an emerging mergers and acquisitions boom in the oil and gas upstream sector Enverus Intelligence released a  in July of this year stating MA activity in the oil and gas upstream sector totaled 24 billion in the second quarter of 2023 tripling from 8 billion in theThe natural question then is which stock can investors look to next in the oil and gas MA boom In this article we will take a look at a stock that has been gaining attention from investors perhaps attributable to the fact that it is one of the worstperforming largecap oil  gas stocks of the year Devon Energy Corporation With a market cap of 28 billion Devon Energy is the sixth largest publicly listed oil  gas exploration company in the United States and the worstperforming of the largecap stocks in its industryPriced at 43 per share DVN stock is currently at 52week lows down a massive 45 from its 52week high down 28 YTD and threatening to make new lows In comparison the iShares Oil  Gas Exploration ETF  is down just 195 YTD and down 14 from its 52week highDoes this massive underperformance from DVN present a major opportunity for investors given the backdrop of an MA boom or signal a major red flagThe market perhaps leans towards the latter Following the WSJ report of Exxons potential takeover of Pioneer the reaction across the remainder of the industry remains muted While as of writing Pioneer stock is up approximately 10 on the news of its pending acquisition none of its peers have managed to gain more than 100 basis points Devon Energy itself is up a mere 06 on the news The markets response may change in the coming days as it fully digests the news but for now this signal or lack thereof suggests that the market doesnt have much faith in another industry megamerger in the immediate futureIn favor of a Devon Energy acquisition it is perhaps the cheapest stock in the industry boasting a forward PE ratio of just 64 in comparison to Pioneers forward PE ratio of 90 based on its price prior to the acquisition announcementPutting aside any potential acquisition for a moment Devon Energy may be worth considering on a pure valuation basis Whether or not Devon Energy is a good value investment hinges largely on whether oil prices will remain elevated  as recently as October 3rd higher oil prices are here to stay attributable to the recent and extended period of underinvestment supply cuts and relentless demand growthInvestors may also be attracted to Devon Energys welldefined dividend strategy to share a substantial portion of its free cash flow with its investors A couple of years ago the oil company introduced a unique dividend framework consisting of a fixed and variable dividend It pays a flat quarterly dividend that it aims to maintain even during periods of lower oil prices Additionally it distributes up to fifty percent of its remaining free cash as variable dividends In the calendar years 2021 and 2022 Devon Energy paid investors dividends totaling 197 and 517 respectively Yields of 46 and 12 based on the current approximate share price of 43 In 2023 YTD Devon has paid investors total dividends of 210 or a 651 annualized yieldThe idea that Devon Energy could be the target of an acquisition is also supported by the geographic location of the companys assets The Enverus Intelligence report cited earlier states that MA activity is largely focused on operations and assets located in the Permian Basin According to Devon Energys The Delaware Basin is the second largest component of the larger Permian Basin and according to  accounts for 64 of the companys combined production volumes across Oil Natural Ga,51,2023-10-07,0

233,Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nationThis has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently however As regular readers may recall we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices although that is almost certainly a factor As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience Investors are no longer willing to wait years or decades to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios In todays highrate environment their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now Energy Transfer currently boasts an 884 yield so it certainly meets this requirement In fact this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the SP 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves however Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense todayAs stated in the introduction Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines storage facilities natural gas liquids fractionators natural gas processing plants and terminals The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant Overall its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific CoastThis is not especially surprising as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state As a result there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a resultAs mentioned earlier it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfers units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfers unit price since August 3 2023We can obviously see a correlation here as the two charts move almost in lockstep However Energy Transfers cash flows have very little to do with oil prices As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90 of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA a proxy for pretax cash flow will come from these volumebased contractsThus the companys financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers not their value As such its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the companys adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years In particular the average price of West Texas Intermediate was 3968 per barrel in 2020 6817 per barrel in 2021 and 9453 per barrel in 2022 The yeartodate average for 2023 is 7790 per barrel and Energy Transfers annualized adjusted EBITDA is 13110 billion Thus we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the companys adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believeWith that said there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do After all there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices However as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Prof,27,2023-10-20,0
234,NextEra Energy: Why This Is An Opportunity To Be Greedy,I started a small position in another beatendown company last week NextEra Energy  which in my opinion provides dividend investors with a contrarian opportunity to invest after one of the companys subsidiaries NextEra Energy Partners While an investment in NextEra Energy certainly has risk I believe the market is overreacting to the announcement With shares of NextEra Energy plunging 25 lately I believe NextEra Energy has not only an attractive risk profile but also material rebound potentialNextEra Energy is a utility company with considerable investments in wind sun and battery storage projects The company had 68 GW in operations in the secondquarter plus another 20 GW in backlog as the company invests in new energy segments and drives growth in its renewables segment NextEra Energy owns Florida Light  Power through which it provides utility services in Florida and NextEra Energy Solutions which consolidates the companys new energy assets 75 of NextEra Energys business relates to FPL and 25 to other energy interestsNextEra Energy is also the parent company of NextEra Energy Partners which was formed in 2014 to acquire manage and own contracted clean energy projects These projects are expected to generate stable cash flows which will be used to pay a growing distribution to the companys unitholdersThe drop in NextEra Energys share price is due to NextEra Energy Partners recently announcing that it will reduce its dividend growth from a range of 1215 annually to a more sustainable range of 58 per year Since NextEra Energys financial prospects are tied to NextEra Energy Partners the utilitys share price has taken a serious hit NextEra Energy Partners also said that will reduce its dividend growth rate due to higher financing costs which are linked to higher interest rates As borrowing becomes more expensive management had to make a decision about curtailed dividend growthNextEra Energy presented dividend investors with near doubledigit adjusted EPS growth in the last decade 10 and translated this earnings momentum into an annual average growth rate of 11 The current dividend payout is 047 per share quarterly which calculates to a dividend yield of 37In the first six months of FY 2023 NextEra Energy achieved adjusted earnings of 35B which calculated to adjusted EPS of 171 This means that the parent company had a dividend coverage ratio of 183 YTD Given the very good dividend coverage of the parent I believe the dividend of NextEra Energy should not be affected by the lowered growth prospects of NextEra Energy Partners NextEra Energy also still expects to grow its adjusted earnings to a range of 363400 by FY 2026 from 290 pershare in FY 2022NextEra Energy is a trading 25 lower after NextEra Energy Partners recently changed its growth outlook I doubt however that a 25 cut to the companys valuation multiplier is an appropriate response given that NextEra Energy has good dividend coverage and sticks to its own growth forecast NextEra Energy is currently trading at 148X FY 2024 earnings which is significantly below the shares 1year average PE ratio of 226X The valuation is more in line with those of its rivals now however I believe investors can continue to expect aboveaverage dividend growth that would be worthy of a premiumIn my opinion dividend investors have overreacted to last weeks growth outlook and investors could see recovery gains in the medium term Shares of NextEra Energy are now way oversold based off of the Relative Strength Index which is a contrarian signal that investors have turned too bearish on the utility companyThere is always a certain amount of risk when buying a company whose share price has dropped significantly in a very short period of time after all it can always go lower However investors also have a tendency to overreact to corporate announcements in the short term which is why I have bought a smal,20,2023-10-09,0

240,Devon Energy: Time To Go Bear Hunting,Devon Energy  has flat out taken a beating over the last 30 days falling nearly 19 since the beginning of September This has occurred while other companies in its peer group have been able to treadI  to identify a trading pattern that developed for sudden price drops following earnings I correctly predicted the dividend payout and response following earnings in Q2 In this article I use the same methodology to show that DVNs recent price performance makes it undervalued todayI propose an explanation for investors looking to understand this price performance as well as a target price to accumulate shares The current price creates a valuable value to price dislocation for DVN that can be extremelyI will be blunt The current price decline for DVN is simply not rooted in logic in any sense of the word Other producers who sell the exact same product do not show the same dismal share performance For comparison there is a 25 difference in price performance between DVN and FANG over the last three months I did not count PXD due to the 10 spike in share price prior to this article being published The last time I checked both of these companies sell oil NGLs and natural gas into essentially the same market What can possibly explain thisSimply put WE are the cause of this DVN has an extremely high exposure to individual investors versus institutional investors compared to its peer group As a result its investor base has shown to be more erratic to market events than typicalThis is in part created by its share price relative to its peers and the lack of a major shareholder like Warren Buffett in the case of OXY In the table below you can see that DVN has 15x to 3x the amount of public ownership exposure compared to Occidental Pioneer or Diamondback Energy All data was obtained from the SA page for each companyI believe the recent price performance is the culmination of individual investors finally having enough after several quarters of falling dividends While in my opinion this should not have been expected the market as a whole never tends to respond rationallyTo prove this thesis the impact of this can again be seen in the volatility of Devons share price DVN exhibits a significantly higher beta than either of the other three companiesMost investors would call this a negative but I view this as one of my fundamental differentiators for why I invest in DVN and not either of the other three stocks Having a higher beta ensures two things Higher highs and lower lowsThis presents investors with the opportunity to invest at more attractive entry points and also the opportunity to trim their profits when they potentially become overvalued You may need a strong stomach at times but this can be counteracted by having a clear vision of what price DVN represents for a solid value purchase Thanks to a fairly simple business model and highly public commodity prices this can be derived from some basic math the average WTI price in Q3 was 8230barrel This is up from 7376barrel in Q2 a very sizeable increase Yet DVN is now at the lowest price so far in 2023 even exceeding the low set in March during the brief banking crisis that developed after the run on Silicon Valley BankFurther DVN has guided both an increase in production and a drop in capital expenses for the quarter and the remainder of the year DVN has guided for capex to  at the midpoint This is down from 1036 billion in Q2 Production is guided to rise to 326000 barrels of oil production per day up from 323000 barrels per day in Q2Running these variables through my model and the slight increase in average natural gas price in Q3 of 259MCF generates net earnings of about 107 billion This is up  when DVN only registered net earnings of 698 million This number was calculated using  provided by DVN for production price realizations taxes and expensesIf the base dividend remains unchanged 020share I expect,57,2023-10-09,0

244,Vaalco Energy: Doubling Down On Acquisition,   appears to have focused upon the growth aspects of the recent  of TransGlobe Energy TGA This likewise appears to be paying dividends in excess of what was publicly anticipated before theThe  Gabon has not affected the company at all according to the press release That is probably because the companys operations are offshore and those operations provide some badly need currency Offshore operations are less likely to be disturbed by something like thisVaalco Energy began as a small player in theEven wells to add production are expensive for a company of this size Therefore enough cash and cash flow was necessary before more drilling could occur as this management wisely decided to keep a debtfree But the acquisition of TransGlobe Energy will allow for production growth in between the major offshore projects that were not originally available to Vaalco Energy The TransGlobe Energy wells are onshore and actually very cheap onshore wells So activity is easy to rachet up or down as industry conditions dictateFurthermore both companies were small enough that production was picked up periodically rather than sold at the time of production as is typical in the United States and Canada The combined companies have a smoother cash inflow than they did separately Therefore there is less need to keep as much cash on hand in between production salesBoth the Canadian and the Egyptian businesses showed growth in the latest quarters have clearly improved Since the majority of these wells are vertical wells drilling time is a larger part of the total well cost than is the case when horizontal drilling and fracking would be involved Management has not yet released payback periods and rates of return on these wells But an improvement shown like the one discussed above is likely to significantly elevate profitabilityThe new issue is the horizontal well Since that type of well is a brandnew idea there is likely to be a period of time between this well and any potential horizontal wells in the future In this area horizontal wells were not needed for some very good production results But an older field could change that attitude That is what management is trying to figure outLike any other production area Egypt has a lot of tired fields and intervals Success of horizontal drilling and modern completion techniques could spur a revival of production in some places that were deemed uneconomical as was the case in the United StatesVery longterm readers may remember that this acreage was originally considered natural gas acreage especially by the seller Clearly enough progress was made to find a very different production mix Many times in the years since this acreage was acquired readers have wondered if it was worth the effort because previous management largely concentrated on the Egyptian businessIt looks like not only was the acquisition worth the effort by previous management it also looks like the acquisition is going to turn out to be a steal The kind of production mix shown above is far more valuable than just natural gas It will also likely be more profitable as wellMore importantly Canada often has acreage nearby that can be acquired to cheaply expand operations if this initial venture proves successful It is very likely that the current management will acquire more acreage in the future given the progress noted aboveIn summary this management has brought more energy to bear on both of these businesses than I have seen in a long time The result is progress I had nearly given up hope in seeing If management keeps up the current pace both businesses will be far more successful than many of us dreamed possible of the original company production before the acquisition of TransGlobe Energy Management had finished a campaign of drilling to expand production The next step is to get those wells producing to the extent possible while rebuilding cash levels to rinse and repe,50,2023-10-12,0

255,9% Yield - MPLX Is A Top Pick For Low-Stress Energy Income,Im a longterm oil and gas bull By now I doubt this comes as a surprise I have close to 20 energy exposure Almost all of it is invested in upstream companies which are the ones that get the commoditiesRight now were in a very volatile period After coming close to 95 WTI oil prices are rapidly declining again as demand fears have hit the market like a wrecking ballAs mentioned in previous  a pullback to 80 is expected due to demand risks and overcrowding in the oil tradeIn general the issue with upstream companies is their volatile behavior While it shouldnt be an issue for seasoned investors who know what they are getting into some investors are better off buying income with less volatility evenThats where midstream companies come inUnlike upstream companies midstream companies do not produce oil and gas They store and ship it connecting producers to customers It also means they do not have direct commodity price exposureThe biggest risk for midstream companies is an event where commodity prices are so low that producers reduce output or demand destruction thats so bad that throughput volumes implode Other than that it wont make much difference to most midstream players whether oil is trading at 70 80 or 100This brings me to This Master Limited Partnership which issues a K1 form is one of just three midstream companies in North America with a yield of 9 or more Please note that I excluded smaller midstream companies with a market cap of less than 10 billion in the table belowOn a side note it also has toptier profitability when looking at the elevated return on assets and return on equityIn this article I will explain why this wellcovered 9 yield is a great way to buy income without having to worry about the oil price on a daily basisSo lets get to itEvery midstream company is differentMPLX for example was formed by Americas largest pureplay refiner Marathon Petroleum  in 2012 MPC owns 12 major refineries and is an essential part of North Americas energy industry especially in the Midwest where it is headquarteredThe company owns and manages a range of midstream energy infrastructure including pipelines marine operations terminals storage facilities and natural gas processing unitsMPLX operates in two primary segmentsNot only does MPC account for most of the companys LS revenues but it also owns 65 of MPLX and general partner shares In 2022 MPC accounted for 47 of MPLXs total revenuesUsually concentrated revenues are a risk However in this case the risk is limited After all MPC needs these assets It cannot switch to a competitor Also because of its significant interest in MPLX there is no need to invest billions in alternativesIf anything I believe the connection with MPC lowers shareholder risks as MPLX has a customer it can count onFurthermore since its birth MPLX has returned 182 including dividends distributions Excluding dividends that number is 29 The Alerian MLP ETF  has returned just 18 during this period  including dividendsHaving said that lets take a closer look under the hood including the companys juicy dividendMPLX pays a 0775 per share per quarter dividend This translates to an annual payout of 310 Given the current stock price of 35 we get a yield of 88The companys dividend has never been cut The same cannot be said about a lot of peers Most investors are still scarred from the Kinder Morgan  cut and remember Energy Transfers  cut during the pandemicOn November 1 2022 the company hiked its dividend by 99At the end of 2021 the company paid a special dividend of 0575 per unit which explains the spike in the chart aboveAccording to Seeking Alpha  MPLX has a 5year dividend CAGR of 49 which isnt bad for a stock yielding 9 and the fact that the past five years included a devastating pandemicFurthermore the company uses buybacks for additional distributions Ov,118,2023-10-05,0

257,NextEra Energy Partners Is A Sell: Evaluating CEPF And Take-Under Risk,NextEra Energy Partners  has plunged to apparently distressed levels with a distribution yield well into the double digits The stock has plunged 50 over the past week alone triggered by an announcement that the company has lowered its targeted distributionIn my last and first report on NEP  I recommended readers to avoid buying the stock At the time NEP was highly touted by my peers but I couldnt reconcile the math to see why this wasnt just a 7 yield with poor growth prospects The stock has been clobbered since then and now trades lower than it did 10 years agoI didnt go far enough My goal in that report was merely to tame bullish expectations To that aim identifying that higher interest rates would significantly hold back growth far from the companys thentarget of 8 to 12 distribution growth was just enough But had I spent more time understanding the ramifications of the convertible equity portfolio financings then I would have instead rated the stock a clear short I am kicking myself for that  and to add insult to injury I even sold a couple puts at a 25 strike price that I have since covered at a nonsignificant loss Even after a big valuation reset I must downgrade the stock to a sell  better late than neverTo the unsuspecting eye the extent of NEPs stock price plunge looks unjustified Sure the stock deserved to fall after lowering both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution CAFD guidance from prior targets of 24 billion and 860 million respectively But the 50 plunge at first glance looks overdone given that management is still targeting 6 distribution growth through 2026The problem is that 6 growth still looks too aggressive In my prior report I have already discussed how higher interest rates should bring growth down to a crawl due to the companys heavy reliance on external acquisitions to drive growth but there I missed something the convertible equity financing buyoutsThis was an issue that was frequently dismissed due to the company having previously outlined plans to sell off their natural gas pipeline portfolio to raise funds as well as parent NEE suspending 157 million in IDRs to offset that sale We can see below that NEP has around 18 billion of convertible equity financing that needs to be paid off over the next few yearsIn total there is around 46 billion of CEPF that needs to be addressed over the coming yearsThe sale of the natural gas pipelines is expected to address around 1518 billion of that if they are able to sell the pipelines at a 10x multiple Even if we assume that they are able to execute on such a transaction which is no guarantee given that the stocks of publicly traded pipeline companies are trading around that 10x EBITDA multiple they still have around 3 billion remaining to deal with I am doubtful that NEP could issue additional unsecured debt to raise financing given that the company is already approaching downgrade thresholdsMoreover issuing debt would likely need to come at a 7 to 8 interest rate if not higher which would heavily impact cash available for distributions 8 interest on 3 billion in debt would amount to 240 million  compare that against 820 million in projected 2023 consolidated CAFDStill though many readers may be thinking that the price is right here with the stock trading at its highest distribution yield everAgain it isnt so simple We should first calculate the valuation There are 190 million shares outstanding inclusive of NEE shares yielding a 43 billion market cap As of the latest quarter there was 59 billion of longterm debt 573 million of nearterm debt and 587 million in cash I have included a breakdown of the debt from the annual report to show the low interest rates of maturing debtI have seen some peers use the above numbers to conclude that NEP is trading at around 4x EBITDA using guidance for 21 billion in adjusted EBITDA But the pr,0,2023-10-24,0

271,Chesapeake Energy And The Electrification Of Energy Demand,  EPS prospects are expected to deliver negative figures until summer 2024 Despite these lackluster prospects I find this stock highly compellingPersonally Ive invested in Antero Resources In fact I argue that this narrative revolves around a substantial and sustainable increase in natural USbased gas demand in 2024 Presently investors show little interest in this sector but now is a really great time to engage with natural gas stocks like Chesapeake EnergyThe global landscape is witnessing a monumental shift as we progress further into the electrification of diverse sectorsWhile the conversation surrounding this movement might not be as prevalent as it deserves its impact isFrom the surge in demand for electricpowered appliances like air conditioners and heat pumps to the growing popularity of electric vehicles EVs the strain on our electricity grids is undeniable Additionally the proliferation of massive data centers crucial for the digital infrastructure further amplifies the demand for reliable and substantial energy sourcesHowever its crucial to recognize that despite the widespread perception of a balanced energy production system the reality is more complex Energy sources vary significantly in their applicability and efficiency for generating electricity The practicality of using diesel for electricity production for instance is fraught with numerous challenges including environmental concerns and inefficienciesConsequently I argue that this leaves only nuclear and natural gas production to meet this increase in demand Ive already discussed nuclear energy  so I wont repeat myself disclosure Im long Uranium Energy Corp These energy sources offer a dependable and robust means of generating electricity providing what I believe to be the main viable solution to the challenges posed by the electrification of various industriesNatural gas serves as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels emitting fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases Furthermore its flexible affordable scalable and lower in carbon emissions than coalNow lets discuss renewable energyThe electrification of everything movement cannot solely rely on renewable energy sources due to the current limitations of the electrical gridThe primary challenge lies in the lack of an efficient energy storage system within the grid infrastructure specifically lithiumion batteries The demand for electricity needs to be carefully balanced with its production a balance often disrupted by the intermittent nature of renewable energy sourcesAlthough renewables generate a substantial amount of energy during the day the peak consumption period typically occurs in the evening after working hours This mismatch underscores the critical need for a massive energy storage solution to bridge the gap between renewable energy production and demand ensuring a more stable and reliable power supply for the electrification movementInvestors look at natural gas prices headed into yet another warm winter and presume that natural gas prices will not reach 4 MMBtu in 2024I argue that this is a faulty assumption The demand for USbased natural gas is going to dramatically increase in 2024 Why Because it doesnt make sense for prices for this coveted commodity to be so cheap in the US while the rest of the world is paying more than 5x the price for this commodityThe feedback I get to this argument is that Europes energy demands for this winter are already sorted out And whilst this is true everything that weve discussed here is about a short medium and longterm demand for natural gasFurthermore its not only Europe that seeks USbased natural gas but Asia too Consequently I argue that natural gas prices will find a floor at around 3 MMBtu and steadily climb from this figure over the next several monthsThe other argument Ive heard from investors is that CHKs EPS comparables look horrible and unpal,5,2023-10-27,0

290,"Daqo New Energy: A New Sunrise, But With Some Clouds",Daqo New Energy  is a leading global producer of polysilicon The company has a number of competitive advantages including highquality products at a low cost strong manufacturing capabilities and a healthy balance sheet Daqo is also exposed to a numberIn the last two decades the weight of China in the polysilicon industry has grown exponentially from less than 5 in 2005 to more than 60 in 2021 The reason behind the growth is the subsidies given by the Chinese government to polysilicon manufacturers alongside However protectionism doesnt tell the whole story Chinese manufacturers such as Tongwei GCLPoly or Daqo have moved their productions to landlocked provinces in China where energy price is lower allowing a costeffective production of highquality polysilicon Note that the highquality polysilicon is produced only by the largest manufacturers in China so China has been partly dependent on foreign manufacturers to produce it Additionally China focuses on monocrystalline solar wafers to ensure higher energy efficiency than multicrystalline solar wafers However as the industry giants expand  this dependence will likely be erased even moreFurthermore China aims to change its electricity capacity from coal to solar and wind It has led China to dominate the global solar panel supply chain Nevertheless China is far from replacing coal and gas as the principal  thus I think the solar energy industry is far from reaching its peak in ChinaAs you see China is the dominant player in every supply chain step Moreover according to  the output of silicon materials in 2022 was only 920000 tonnes in China equivalent to 370GW of silicon wafers while the wafer production capacity is 621 GW Consequently from my perspective the polysilicon industry can keep expanding its production in fact  estimates an annual growth rate of 1321 until 2028Nonetheless this industry is harsh for many producers as the supply cannot adapt to fastchanging demand and history shows us many stages of oversupply and undersupply The process of building a plant and starting production could take  and once the construction is started it is hard to stop it without incurring significant financial lossesConsequently when prices are up incumbents expand production and new companies enter the market to realize they now have a sizeable idle capacity as demand slows and prices go down Low prices drive less costefficient companies out of the market which along with a recovery of demand increases the prices and the cycle starts againSpecifically in 2022 the  polysilicon price soared higher than 35 per Kg which lures new entrants and China and further expansions of incumbents However Chinese companies aim to keep ramping up production even if market conditions do not seem appropriate as they focus on substituting all the output with costeffective production For instance the CEO of Daqo in 2018 estimated that only a third of all Chinese output was costeffective in 2017Seeing the planned expansion by all these companies its clear why the Chinese price of polysilicon fell under 10 per kg in 2023 as the new additions ended up in a sizeable idle capacity As can be noted in the chart below the price has stabilized at around 10 per Kg after plummeting more than 70 During this period 1H23 according to the Ministrys  Chinese companies produced 606000 tons of polysilicon an increase of 661 YoY Nevertheless the demand continues to be strong as the China Photovoltaic Industry Association revised its forecast for annual solar PV installations in China to 120 GW to 140 GWAlthough the price has fallen significantly I believe that Daqo and other Chinese manufacturers will keep doing fine in the future as the demand for their products in China will be continuous as China aims to increase renewable energy sources Furthermore Daqos management estimates to produce between 193000 and 1980,19,2023-10-03,0

309,"Daqo New Energy: A New Sunrise, But With Some Clouds",Daqo New Energy  is a leading global producer of polysilicon The company has a number of competitive advantages including highquality products at a low cost strong manufacturing capabilities and a healthy balance sheet Daqo is also exposed to a numberIn the last two decades the weight of China in the polysilicon industry has grown exponentially from less than 5 in 2005 to more than 60 in 2021 The reason behind the growth is the subsidies given by the Chinese government to polysilicon manufacturers alongside However protectionism doesnt tell the whole story Chinese manufacturers such as Tongwei GCLPoly or Daqo have moved their productions to landlocked provinces in China where energy price is lower allowing a costeffective production of highquality polysilicon Note that the highquality polysilicon is produced only by the largest manufacturers in China so China has been partly dependent on foreign manufacturers to produce it Additionally China focuses on monocrystalline solar wafers to ensure higher energy efficiency than multicrystalline solar wafers However as the industry giants expand  this dependence will likely be erased even moreFurthermore China aims to change its electricity capacity from coal to solar and wind It has led China to dominate the global solar panel supply chain Nevertheless China is far from replacing coal and gas as the principal  thus I think the solar energy industry is far from reaching its peak in ChinaAs you see China is the dominant player in every supply chain step Moreover according to  the output of silicon materials in 2022 was only 920000 tonnes in China equivalent to 370GW of silicon wafers while the wafer production capacity is 621 GW Consequently from my perspective the polysilicon industry can keep expanding its production in fact  estimates an annual growth rate of 1321 until 2028Nonetheless this industry is harsh for many producers as the supply cannot adapt to fastchanging demand and history shows us many stages of oversupply and undersupply The process of building a plant and starting production could take  and once the construction is started it is hard to stop it without incurring significant financial lossesConsequently when prices are up incumbents expand production and new companies enter the market to realize they now have a sizeable idle capacity as demand slows and prices go down Low prices drive less costefficient companies out of the market which along with a recovery of demand increases the prices and the cycle starts againSpecifically in 2022 the  polysilicon price soared higher than 35 per Kg which lures new entrants and China and further expansions of incumbents However Chinese companies aim to keep ramping up production even if market conditions do not seem appropriate as they focus on substituting all the output with costeffective production For instance the CEO of Daqo in 2018 estimated that only a third of all Chinese output was costeffective in 2017Seeing the planned expansion by all these companies its clear why the Chinese price of polysilicon fell under 10 per kg in 2023 as the new additions ended up in a sizeable idle capacity As can be noted in the chart below the price has stabilized at around 10 per Kg after plummeting more than 70 During this period 1H23 according to the Ministrys  Chinese companies produced 606000 tons of polysilicon an increase of 661 YoY Nevertheless the demand continues to be strong as the China Photovoltaic Industry Association revised its forecast for annual solar PV installations in China to 120 GW to 140 GWAlthough the price has fallen significantly I believe that Daqo and other Chinese manufacturers will keep doing fine in the future as the demand for their products in China will be continuous as China aims to increase renewable energy sources Furthermore Daqos management estimates to produce between 193000 and 1980,19,2023-10-03,0

374,Energy Transfer: An Old Adversary Threatens A Material Future Change,Energy Transfer  has had a quiet time since the Army Corps was ordered to come up with a new study on the effects of the DAPL pipeline That has led more than a few investors to think thatMaking matters dicier was the fact that theNow it looks like the process will again get going One of the main issues in the past included the Energy Transfer operator record in Pennsylvania Those issues are now settled and a matter of record How those results weigh into what is about to happen is another matterHere is the note from Phillips 66 Partners which is now part of Phillips 66 Source Phillips 66 Partners Since Phillips 66 Partnership was the smallest partner in the DAPL partnership and was its own legal entity at the time there was a good deal more detail on the ongoing dispute in the legal filings of this entity until it was merged into Phillips 66 This management stated in several conference calls that they expected the court fight to continue for yearsThe problem was that everything died down until the latest study was complete There really was nothing legal to be done until the results became public Now it appears there will be a period of public commenting before the next step That means that any court filings are likely to happen next yearThe key is that as the operator of this partnership this news is likely to overshadow anything else Energy Transfer does and the uncertainty surrounding this issue is one significant reason that the partnership common units are considered cheap and are likely to stay cheap until this issue is resolvedThose of us who have followed Energy Transfer long term know that the record here is probably on the minimal side from all these issues that are likely to detract from profitabilityAs the Seeking Alpha website shows this is one of the least profitable operators in the industry It is also very large and investment grade A court case like this if it goes in a big time unfavorable direction could have a material impact on the future of the company overnightOne of the things about the Quant system is that it is primarily a numbers system There is really no impact on a system like this for something like the DAPL case that is really a footnote in most official reports The only real cost at the current time is legal fees which are likely to be very small compared to the operations of a big company like thisTherefore the quant system is really unable to forecast the effects of a potential liability like this Instead evaluating the liability is a qualitative process Once the court case is decided and all appeals and other motions have been dealt with then there will be considerably more certainty to the outlook that something like that quant system can deal withStill the system has a hold rating on the common units This does indicate some trepidation in the market that likely relates to the uncertainty of all options listed in the Army Corps of Engineers report studyOne of the things that investors nearly always underestimate is risk David Dreman in his latest book Contrarian Investment Strategy The Psychological Edge has noted this But so have many other authorsThe mathematical argument would be something like thisThe reason is that many will go for Case 2 because the returns look good until a loss year happens Many times that loss year is far in excess of the 25 shown But many investors assume that year will not happen because it did not in the pastFor me I have followed many examples like this The latest of those was my coverage of California Resources  up until the bankruptcy  year 2020 The comments to my articles clearly state that the company had valuable land that would get it out of trouble Alternatively the company had a lot of reserves behind each share never mind that no one reviewed the high cost of those reserves or lack of profitability of the company compared to debt levelsSo when California Resources soared before ,485,2023-09-17,0

387,Peabody Energy - What's Up With Coal?,Coal is in a tricky spot In 2020 everyone was convinced that coal was dead Newcastle Coal futures were trading at 50 per ton one of the lowest numbers in modern history Economic growth was in a very bad spot and everyone wasWhile renewable energy is still a hot topic coal isnt going anywhere Currently coal futures are significantly lower than their 2022 highs which occurred when the world had to quickly transition to coal due to the high cost of natural gas However we are still far from the lows that were observed before the surge in coal demand in 2021Coal seems to have plateaued at least for the time being For example looking at the EIAs  which was published on July 3 we seeIn other words were witnessing that the US is playing an increasingly important role in facilitating international coal demand Its production and exports remain strong while domestic consumption is steadily declining fueled by the ongoing energy transition This is good news for  which recently released its earnings and continues to do quite well despite secular challenges in the domestic coal industry While its stock price is trading roughly 34 below its 52week high the company is upbeat about its future and eager to let shareholders participate in its success In this article Ill walk you through the companys numbers and discuss the riskreward for investors So lets get to it Because most investors including me went into the past winter with expectations of severe energy shortages the surprisingly warm winter weather caused investors to unwind very bullish bets on coal natural gas and related It also left some nations with large coal stockpiles Even my home country the Netherlands briefly turned into a net export nation of coal because it had too much coal The result was the decline in coal prices I discussed in the introduction Having said that theres good news  despite the ongoing decline in economic growth expectations To quote Peabody Energy emphasis addedHeres a recent screenshot from Google showing coalsupporting China headlinesNot only is this great news for American coal exports and prices but it should also be reflected in the 3Q23 earnings of major American railroads which ship coal from mines to export facilities In the case of Peabody Energy these railroads are Buffettowned BNSF and Union Pacific  which services mines like its North Antelope Mine the worlds largest coal mine Moving over to steelmaking coal the seaborne metallurgical market experienced variable global crude steel output with China and India showing notable growthMetallurgical coal supply remained constrained due to weather events keeping premium hardcoking coal pricing elevatedDespite challenges demand for seaborne thermal coal remained robust and supply constraints across key regions are expected to balance out due to peak summer energy demand and winter restockingBTUs seaborne thermal coal exports in the second quarter surpassed expectations at 26 million tons thanks to the completion of a Longwall move at its Wambo mine and improved weather conditionsSeaborne met coal shipments also exceeded projections driven by strong sales from the CMJV CoppabellaMoorvale Joint Venture complex in AustraliaThe company also successfully resumed operations at Shoal Creek after a firstquarter fire focusing on the new L panel area for better mining conditionsThe PRB Powder River Basin experienced lowerthananticipated shipments due to low customer demand high coal inventory levels natural gas pricing and a tornado event These are essentially the fundamental headwinds discussed in the first part of this article Having said that the company is preparing to boost coal output in 2024 which should hopefully come with a bottom in global economic growth but its too early to make that call With this in mind lets take a look at the performance per segment including some comments before we mov,34,2023-08-03,0

389,3 Reasons Why TC Energy Is A Better Buy Than Energy Transfer,TC Energy  and Energy Transfer  are two investment grade high yielding midstream infrastructure businesses that have large and welldiversified portfolios Moreover we own both and think both are undervalued at present While ET has long been  and stillBoth businesses have solid balance sheets and ETs balance sheet in particular has been strengthened considerably in recent years After slashing its distribution in half in late 2020 in the wake of the energy market crash and its investment grade credit rating being threatened ET management has aggressively paid down debt and brought its leverage ratio down to within its longterm target range ofMeanwhile TRP has a better credit rating than ET with a BBB scoring from SP albeit with a negative outlook However TRP took a significant step forward in securing its credit rating and strengthening its balance sheet by  a 39 billion stake in its Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf Transmission systems As a result it is now on much firmer financial footing and has more flexibility moving forward to invest in growth projects and return capital to shareholdersIn addition to its slightly higher credit rating what sets TRPs balance sheet apart from ETs is that its debt maturity ladder is in better shape As of the end of 2022 41 of ETs debt  by the end of 2027 putting considerably pressure on them to either pay down debt aggressively as it matures which would in turn limit ETs ability to invest in growth projects andor grow returns of capital to unitholders or potentially absorb meaningfully higher interest expense given that interest rates have risen so rapidly in recent yearsMeanwhile TRPs weighted average term to maturity is a whopping 20 years with much of its debt not due for decades to come This gives it a very stable cost of debt profile which is very valuable at a time when interest rates have risen so rapidly Moreover its recent large asset stake sales give it considerable capital to pay down debt that matures in the near futureWhile ET has closed some of the gap with TRP in this category over the past few years TRPs recent asset stake sale continues to give it the edge in balance sheet strengthTRPs greatest strength relative to ET is its asset portfolio While ET is certainly well diversified and generates the vast majority 90 of its cash flow from feebased contracted assets TRP has a superior combined contractedregulated exposure 95 compared to ETs Moreover much of its 95 contractedregulated exposure comes from regulated assets which are utilitylike in nature with investment grade counterparties making them inherently more defensive and higher quality in nature than ETs contracted assets TRPs contracted assets are also extremely competitively positioned with lengthy contract terms giving them a more stable cash flow profile than ETs assets have in aggregateWith some of the very best midstream assets on the North American continent TRPs portfolio is built to last As Morningstar  its portfolioLast but not least we think that TRP stock has more upside potential than ET stock at the moment As you can see in the chart below ET stock has risen nicely over the past year whereas TRPs stock price has lost nearly one quarter of its valueWhile ET remains slightly undervalued in our view  thereby justifying its stock price appreciation over the past year  TRP has traded down to at least some degree in a manner that is unjustified Mr Market disliked the uncertainty that came with the asset sale program was somewhat disappointed by the valuation that the company fetched for its asset stake sale and now appears to be a bit unhappy about its announced  of its liquids business However the underlying asset portfolio remains very high quality and performing quite well the balance sheet is in quite solid shape and we believe that the spinoff will actually  for the business Meanwhile the dividend remai,248,2023-09-04,0

395,The Costs And Investment Implications Of Reshoring,For the past three decades and in some ways stretching back up to five decades the US has been in a relative industrial declineMore specifically the share of the US economy that has been involved with manufacturingWe can see this manifested in our structural trade deficitAnd we can see it in our industrial production per capitaTo some extent this is to be expected as a country grows in wealth it tends to shift a bit more towards services and begins to rely on developing countries to supply it with physical goods However a number of countries like Switzerland Singapore Japan South Korea Taiwan and at least until their recent energy problems Germany have been successful at maintaining largeThe challenge with deindustrialization is that an economy can become hollowedout andor it can face national security issues during a cold war type of environment or during various logistical emergencies In other words its just not just about access to plastic trinkets its about access to critical things we dont think about like medical dyes military components or even just basic tools that we use for everything elseSo the themes of onshoring or reshoring or nearshoring have become a hot topic lately to some extent on the corporate level but especially on the federal level It refers to the idea of moving manufacturing facilities back to the US or to nearby countries so that supply chains in general are shorter less complex and more resilient And along these lines various stimulus efforts have gone into encouraging a boom in domestic manufacturingAnd it  showing up in the data This chart shows annualized spending on the construction of manufacturing facilitiesThe US used to run sub100 billion per year in manufacturing construction expenditure and now it has more than doubled Thats tangible even after adjusting for inflationHowever to provide context to the situation the US is currently heavily reliant on Chinas industrial base that is worth many trillions of dollars So this extra 100 billion just puts us in the first inning here if this is indeed to be the start of a reversalFor decades the United States was a larger trading partner than China for most countries However by the late 2010s China had flipped the US in this regard and it has only tilted further in Chinas favor since thenThe ability to be the worlds largest trading partner requires both making stuff and having the logistics to organize and ship that stuff Along those lines among the  seven are in China one is in Korea one is in Singapore and one is in the Netherlands To find the US on the list we have to dig down into the top 20 and top 30 container portsChina now produces more steel than the rest of the world combined and more than 12x as much as the USChina is by far the world leader in solar panels In terms of market share they are more important for the global solar market than Saudi Arabia is for the global oil marketFor rare earth elements broadly which are widely used throughout the electronics industry including the alternative energy industry China produces more than the rest of the world combined In recent years the rest of the world exUS has been regaining a minority share Rare earth elements are not particularly rare but they are found in low concentrations and thus tend to be environmentally destructive to extract and refine Most wealthy regions dont want to deal with thatJust within the past three years Chinas auto exports have hockeysticked in terms of growth Last year China surpassed Germany and this year they are  as the worlds largest auto exporter We dont see them in the United States but if you travel around the world youll see a lot more Chinese cars on the road than just a few years agoHere in 2023 China also officially put their first commercial airplane  into service The world now has the ABCs of commercial aviation Airbus  of E,161,2023-08-12,0

407,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time,1306,2023-08-14,0

419,Exxon Mobil To Buy Pioneer? 3 Fantastic Alternative Stocks I'm Buying,I did not expect to write this article so soon after I wrote an  titled  That article was written on August 29 In that article I reiteratedWhile I dont mind Exxon Mobil paying a premium for stocks that I own I hate this potential deal as I wanted to hold PXD for many decades benefitting from its ability to reward investors with special dividends In this article Ill walk you through the potential deal and explain how Im dealing with this situation AfterSo lets get to itWhen talking about Exxon I always use it as an opportunity to brag a bit about my investment in the company In 2020 I bought Exxon in the low 30 range which was a few cents away from its multidecade low The company was the first upstream energy holding of what would become an energyoverweight portfolio As some readers may remember I sold Exxon because I wanted a stock with special dividends As much as I still like Exxon I prefer companies that are focused on oil production have deep reserves efficient production a healthy balance sheet and this is why I sold Exxon plans to distribute almost every cent of free cash flow to shareholders Now Exxon is buying that company from me  so it seems In an  that ruined my sleep the Wall Street Journal wrote that Exxon is preparing to make a massive bid for Pioneer According to the article Exxon Mobil is in advanced negotiations to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources which is a potential gamechanging takeover valued at approximately 60 billion that could significantly reshape the US oil industry Please note that this implies roughly a premium of roughly 20 The deal expected to be finalized within the coming days would grant Exxon a dominant position in the oilrich Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico aligning with the companys growth plansIf completed the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources with a market capitalization of about 50 billion would stand as Exxons largest deal since its merger with Mobil in 1999This strategic move comes after Exxons recordbreaking profit in 2022 leaving the company financially robust and eager to delve deeper into West Texas shaleLooking at Bloomberg data below Exxon has been doing so well lately thanks to elevated oil and gas prices It also benefited from favorable refinery spreads After all its one of the worlds largest refiners as well As Ive written in many almost countless articles the US shale industry is going through a transition Were beyond peak supply growth not peak supply companies are slowly running out of Tier 1 reserves the best drilling spots and even the mighty Permian Basin is expected to see peak production not peak production growth in 4Q24 When adding that most companies make billions in excess cash in this environment it makes sense that MA talks are heating up According to the Wall Street Journal the prospective ExxonPioneer deal may signal a broader trend of consolidation within the shale industry as companies face the imperative to extend their drilling capabilities and secure their future amid diminishing drilling opportunitiesPioneer in this case might be one of the best takeover targets With its expansive acreage in West Texas particularly in the highly productive Midland Basin Pioneer stands as a key player in the US shale boom The companys substantial untapped drilling locations and wellpositioned assets make it an attractive target for Exxon in a potential acquisition that could pave the way for further industry consolidation in the Permian BasinInterestingly enough just yesterday I was interviewed by a major publication in the US about exactly these benefits As the overview below shows Pioneer has more than 20 years worth of highreturn inventory in the Midland Basin No peer even comes close to that in this highmargin basin Not only that the company is also in a good position to sell its gas In the second half of this year 70 of its natura,109,2023-10-06,0
420,There Is Way Too Much Misinformation On U.S. Oil Production,Thanks to the EIAs new quest of eliminating the adjustment factor people are now completely misunderstanding US oil productionIn EIAs latest weekly oil storage report it rebenchmarked US weekly oil production higher by 300k bd For those of you who areBut at the start of the year the new EIA administrator following months of scrutiny on the unexplainable elevated adjustment figure decided to embark on a study to identify why the adjustment is so high During this study period it found that transfers to crude oil and underreported US crude production were factors that contributed to elevated adjustmentFrom what weve seen so far in the monthly reports roughly 500k bd to 600k bd are attributed to transfers to crude oil while the remainder was attributed to underreported productionTaking all this into account our methodology of always using the adjustment to calculate real supply in the US was unchanged by this methodology change from the EIAYou can see this in our oil production matrixNow you will notice that bluedotted line going straight up Thats the EIA attempting to explain away the ridiculous weekly adjustment figureBut we want you to take a closer look at our production matrix If you go all the way back to May 2018 you will notice the closely fitted lines amongst all of the things we track By 2019 there was a separation between reported US oil production EIA 914 and the EIA 914  adjustment figure Thats when transfers to crude oil became a much bigger thing which in our view is likely what caused adjustment to start becoming so elevatedIn fact the adjustment became such a big issue that we started incorporating plant condensate or our version of the adjustment into our weekly US crude storage estimates And since weve started tracking this it averaged 500k bd from 2018 to 2023But this is where things get really interestingIf you look at our modified adjustment we only separate out actual imports and exports to what EIA reports But if US oil production is structurally underreported then our modified adjustment will be elevated regardless Similarly with the methodology change that the EIA has adopted our modified adjustment will become structurally lower going forward Netnet there wont be any real change to the supply side since all of this has been included from the beginningSo to summarize EIAs attempt at solving the mysteries of the adjustment factor is leading the public to believe that theres been a major surge in US oil production when in fact its the exact oppositeNow lets talk about the fun stuffIn our latest associated gas production update weve seen a meaningful drop in production You will notice that this is in stark contrast to what we are seeing on the crude production sideIn addition if we look at our highfrequency US oil production tracking we dont see it making a new high by yearendIn essence we dont expect US oil production to push higher going forward Without an uptick in associated gas production EIAs own adjustment figure is going to tip into a consistent negative which will suggest that US oil production is overstated at 132 million bdBeware of oil tourists talking about how US oil production increased 12 million bd from the end of last year to today They dont know what they are talking aboutThe reality is that US oil production is growing but because we are comparing apples to oranges yoy comparisons become irrelevant when discussing US oil production going forward You can thankblame the EIA for that oneThank you for reading this article We launched our oil trading portfolio in 2019 The oil trading portfolio is designed to take advantage of shortterm longshort oil and energy stock trades in the market For readers interested in our positioning along with realtime trades    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being giv,19,2023-10-20,0

426,"XLE: Crude Oil Goes Boom - Protect Yourself, Buy Energy",On April 20 I wrote an  titled  In that article I made the case to buy energy stocks to be protected from what could become aHeres a part of my takeawaySince then the Energy ETF  has rallied roughly 11 beating the SP 500 by 300 basis pointsNow its time for an update Not only have I written countless articles on various energy stocks updating my bull case but weve also seen a confirmation of my thesisAfter breaking out in July crude oil futures are back at 90 Thats despite poor consumer confidence and a general downtrend in economic growthIn this article Ill discuss the drivers of this bull case and explain why I continue to believe that owning energy stocks is so importantSo lets get to itLike every other commodity oil is all about supply and demandThe supply picture is what worries me meaning it could cause high inflation for many years to come because major basins in the US are running out of steamAfter the Great Financial Crisis US shale production was the reason why global oil prices were subdued most of the time especially after 2014 In 2007 the US produced roughly 500 thousand barrels of oil per day using unconventional measures horizontal drilling Now that number is 8 million barrels per day higherThis annoyed OPEC a lot It even annoyed US producers as they were producing so much that every decline in demand caused oil prices to crashSo many smaller players went bust in the past few yearsNow things are changing US shale is running out of stream Were not seeing peak oil but a significant decline in supply growth Producers are seeing rapidly declining Tier 1 drilling reserves They focus on free cash flow generation instead of production growth and reward investors through dividends and buybacksThey have learned their lesson  especially in an environment where new climate movements want to put big oil out of businessAs the chart above shows shale production is barely higher than it was prior to the pandemic The only basin with growth left is the Permian the big oneEven that basin is expected to reach peak production in 4Q24With the US losing pricing power OPEC is witnessing a chance to become more powerfulOne of the reasons why oil is back at 90 is aggressive output cuts from OPEC mainly Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants to protect 80 Brent at all costs It also seems to be willing to defend 90 Brent given that they announced an extension of the cutsBecause of the supply squeeze were dealing with an increasing supply shortfall pushing up pricesWe can assume that OPEC is likely playing a political game here While Im obviously not a political insider who knows what for example the Saudis are up to I can imagine what they are doing hereLooking at the chart below we see that crude oil storage levels in the US are way below anything weve seen over the past five years and before thatIncluding the strategic reserves reserves are more than 200 million barrels below their longerterm average Also were going into a major election year I doubt Biden  or any Democrat  wants to buy back oil in this environmentHaving said that demand developments are also favorableAs reported by  on September 14 forecasts from leading energy analysts suggest that global crude oil consumption is on an unstoppable ascentThe International Energy Agency IEA projects a recordbreaking 1022 million barrels per day for this year with a relentless climb to 1057 mbd by 2028Exxon Mobil  also anticipates demand to surge by roughly 75 mbd until it peaks in 2040Whats interesting is that the IEA do not confuse this with the EIA isnt that bullish Its outlook includes barely any demand growth through 2028They do not expect 2018 levels to be reached before 2025 as most consumption is expected to come from natural gas liquids and biofuelsAccording to Bloombergs David Fickling we could be looking at a peak demand scenario for crude oil,91,2023-09-15,0
427,Chord Energy: At The Mercy Of Rising Oil Prices,Chord Energy is an oil and gas exploration company primarily focused in the Bakken Shale in the greater Williston Basin area in North Dakota The company currently trades with a market cap of 68 billionThe company resultedOasisThe combined company just recently made an acquisition from XTO Energy in June 2023 where it acquired interests in acreage on the edges of their existing acreage in the Williston Basin With this acquisition the company expects to achieve a 20 percent IRRThis slide gives a broad overview of Chord If you are interested in investing purely in a Bakken Shale and Williston Basin play then this company is one to consider According to them they are the largest acreage holder in the play If they continue drilling at their current pace they have 10 years of existing drilling inventory Like many companies they are focused on disciplined capital management while paying the combination of a base dividend and a variable dividend while remaining flexible to fluctuating hydrocarbon pricesThis slide outlines Chords return of capital program They are in the mode of returning most of their Free Cash Flow to shareholders in the form of dividends both base and variable and share buybacks This makes up 81 percent of the free cash flow since the two companies merged Their strong balance sheet gives them the ability to return a large percentage of their free cash flow to shareholdersThe company is very disciplined with their balance sheet With a debttoasset ratio of 27 they maintain one of the lowest leverage ratios that Ive seen thus far In a rising interest rate environment more and more companies will begin to focus on decreasing their debt ratios This is truly one of Chord Energys strengthsWhen you dig into Chord Energys balance sheet further you will realize that the company only has 400 million in longterm unsecured debt due June 2026 with a 6375 interest rate All of the companys other liabilities are shortterm and are adequately covered by the companys shortterm assetsHere is the track record of Chords operating cash flows and free cash flow Following the great oil price crash of 2020 the company rebounded and is now once again deploying heavier amounts of capex to maintain and grow its oil production I will discuss this further in the article in a comparison to Permian ResourcesWest Texas Intermediate oil prices reached a high of roughly 120 in 2022 and have since come down into the 80s range The companys cash flow jumped with oil prices appropriately in 2022 and is remaining steadyI always like to look at the shares outstanding over a certain timeframe to see how often they sell shares for financing reasons Since the merger completed in 2022 the companys shares have remained stable and given the strength of the balance sheet and that they are leveraged to oil and not natural gas dilution is a low riskChord has a very light hedging strategy For a company that doesnt use very much leverage they can operate without hedging as they can survive dramatic downturns like we saw in 2020For a company that uses higher amounts of balance sheet leverage you might see them using derivatives to manage their risk a bit more aggressively That is not the case for Chord EnergyGiven the companys laser focus in the Williston Basin this allows them the ability to fine tune things so that they can generate greater returns Currently they are doing so by experimenting with longer laterals while at the same time completing each well faster The longer lateral naturally reduces the cost per foot of drillingThey are also seeing greater returns from greater wellspacing Of course this means less wells However a company could drill 100 wells with narrow spacing with a 2 percent IRR or a 20 wells with wide spacing with a 20 percent IRR Which one would you rather haveOne of the strikes against investing in Chord is that they are behaving very conservatively As you can se,8,2023-10-15,0

431,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,This followup article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in US energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering 20072022 In this period the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet BCF of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas it is important to first reference some history Before that we want to lay out some relevant terminology Natural Gas not surprisingly is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature It is measured in cubic feet at sea level volume increases or decreases with pressure It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet MCFConveniently one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1036 million BTU one author has a friend who considers this one of the proofs of the existence of God and this makes certain calculations easier for example a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs After this removal the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumersFirst a little bit of simplified but instructive history Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers these phases have been 1 nuisance 2 luxury 3 necessity and 4 national security At first it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually flared In fact one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using noflare orders Natural gas began to be used in cities but this was largely city gas produced from coalIt dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks and pipelines started to make their way across the country All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions So far so goodThen the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and the FPC now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers The experts at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production There were various estimates most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by nowThis policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973 Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels fuels for power plants and in other applications As oil prices rose more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices In addition producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state intrastate gas was not price regulated leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those marketsA complex mess emerged  loved by lawyers and lobbyists but hated by the public Each interstate pipeline had curtailment proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand One point was widely agreed  natural gas could never be used under a boiler i,265,2023-10-09,0

438,Canadian Natural Resources Is One Of The Best Oil Stocks Money Can Buy, I finally pulled the trigger on a stock Ive had on my watchlist since the day I first researched it Last month I deployed a big portion ofWhen I say that the company behind the CNQ ticker is one of the best oil companies on Earth Im serious CNQ has everything Im looking for in an energy stock This includes deep reserves low breakeven prices a healthy balance sheet a great dividend track record and the aim to distribute almost every penny of excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks Especially at a time when US shale production which was the global supply engine between the Great Financial Crisis and 2021 is running out of momentum I think investors need to be prepared for a prolonged period of elevated energy prices and invest in companies with deep reserves in a time when most are running out of tier 1 drilling inventory Currently the Permian is the only basin in the US capable of strong growth All other major basins have gone sideways since the pandemicNow even the Permian is expected to reach peak production at the end of next year as I discussed in a recent  On top of these bullish secular longterm developments  Arabia is determined to defend 80 Brent by all means necessary which is currently adding to the oil price rally Thats where CNQ comes in Not only do I need investments to protect my portfolio against inflation but its also a terrific income vehicle with the potential to outperform its peers and the market by a wide marginSo lets get to the detailsAs its 65 billion market cap may suggest Canadian Natural Resources is a giant In the second quarter the company achieved a quarterly production of around 119 million BOEs barrels of oil equivalent per day including natural gas production of about 21 bcf per day and production of liquids of roughly 847000 barrels per dayThese numbers were influenced by operational impacts from wildfires in Western Canada thirdparty pipeline outages and planned turnaround activitiesThe wildfires led to temporary shutdowns of some assets between May and July with no significant damage reported Most of the production affected by the wildfires has been restored which is the biggest takeaway when it comes to these fires Furthermore oil production from international assets remained steady Heavy oil production in 2Q23 increased by 15 compared to the prioryear quarter supported by strong drilling results counteracting natural field declinesOperating costs for heavy oil decreased primarily due to lower natural gas fuel costsWith that in mind the company has more than 30 years of proven reserves which beats its average peer by more than ten years Last year the companys new reserves exceeded production which shows that the company has way more than 30 years worth of highquality production which protects it against forced MA deals down the road  the same cannot be said about a wide range of peers Adding to that the company is breakeven at roughly 40 WTI which makes it one of the most efficient oil producers in the world It also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet The company ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of 07x EBITDA and remains wellprepared in terms of liquidity boasting substantial resources such as revolving bank facilities cash reserves and shortterm investments As of the end of 2Q the companys liquidity stood at an impressive 56 billionAccording to my calculations the company ended the second quarter with 121 billion in net debt Going into 2024 it could reach its target of 10 billion Once the net debt level has reached 10 billion the company sees no need to lower it further as it has pledged to distribute all of its free cash flow to shareholders In this case the company beats most of its peers that have pledged to distribute between 70 and 80 of free cash flow A big part of its distribution consists of dividends,90,2023-08-04,0

449,Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nationThis has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently however As regular readers may recall we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices although that is almost certainly a factor As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience Investors are no longer willing to wait years or decades to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios In todays highrate environment their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now Energy Transfer currently boasts an 884 yield so it certainly meets this requirement In fact this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the SP 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves however Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense todayAs stated in the introduction Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States boasting a network of pipelines storage facilities natural gas liquids fractionators natural gas processing plants and terminals The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant Overall its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific CoastThis is not especially surprising as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state As a result there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a resultAs mentioned earlier it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfers units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfers unit price since August 3 2023We can obviously see a correlation here as the two charts move almost in lockstep However Energy Transfers cash flows have very little to do with oil prices As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90 of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA a proxy for pretax cash flow will come from these volumebased contractsThus the companys financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers not their value As such its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the companys adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years In particular the average price of West Texas Intermediate was 3968 per barrel in 2020 6817 per barrel in 2021 and 9453 per barrel in 2022 The yeartodate average for 2023 is 7790 per barrel and Energy Transfers annualized adjusted EBITDA is 13110 billion Thus we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the companys adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believeWith that said there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do After all there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices However as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Prof,17,2023-10-22,0

458,Pioneer Natural And Exxon Mobil: The Benefits Of An All-Stock Deal,My history with shale driller   was a very short one As I reported in this  I sold my sizable position in 3M Company Obviously these are all very solid companies with PXD having extremely highquality assets in the Midland Basin in West Texas many of which the company acquired before the shale boom I love it when a company focuses onI wasnt entirely surprised when news of PXDs acquisition by   made the rounds as the supermajor had been in  about a possible takeover as early as April 2023 The takeover scenario was arguably a small part of my investment thesis even given the fact that PXD CEO Sheffield  at the end of 2023 and in light of the favorable PXDXOM spread at that time Figure 1  the latter of course assuming an allstock dealConsidering that I chose PXD because of its prime acreage excellent cash flow profitability management discipline but also because it is comparatively smaller and therefore receives comparatively little media attention which is not a bad thing in todays environment one might conclude that I am disappointed with the XOM transaction After all it is an allstock transaction so if I dont sell my PXD shares I become a shareholder of Exxon MobilHowever after looking into the situation I am actually very pleased with the proposed deal There are two main reasons for my positive attitude towards the transaction which I will explain in this updateI bought my position in PXD at approximately 200 per share well aware that the bottom of the last supercycle is behind us and that the serious supplydemand imbalance  which is quite well known  has been factored into oil and gas OG company valuations at least to some degree In the above article I acknowledged my procyclical behaviorGiven the high volatility of the price of oil and the inherent unpredictability of future demand leaving aside the obvious supplydemand imbalance see these  it is of course difficult if not futile to value an OG company via the discounted cash flow model or multiplesbased approaches However using a peer groupbased valuation approach it became clear that the stock is definitely one of the more expensive ones in the sector at 200 I intentionally paid up for quality Meanwhile it is known that Exxon  Pioneer in a transaction that values the stock at 253 per share well above what I consider comparative expensive but acceptable due to the high qualityHowever I am not suggesting here that Exxon massively overpaid We need to be aware that PXD shareholders would likely vote against the deal at a lower offer PXD was trading at above 250 shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began Moreover we are well past the lows of the last cycle and fundamentals have changed dramatically in recent years in favor of OG companies with worldclass assets and solid balance sheetsOf course with its diversified portfolio and contrarian stance compared to many other OG companies I think Exxon is one of the better supermajors think of its  as it remains highly committed to existing and new OG projects However I am ambivalent between Exxon and Chevron Corp  which I think is a great company but whose investments in renewables I am somewhat ambivalent about see eg p 11 ff in this  I already own a position in CVX and have thought about opening a position in XOM but consider the companys valuation to be a bit high in terms of pricetoearnings ratio and pricetoearnings growth Figure 2 Granted the PEG ratio in particular is not necessarily a meaningful valuation metric in the context of OG companies From the perspective of enterprise value EV to EBITDA which takes into account the companys net debt I believe XOM stock is fairly valued As an incomeoriented investor I found XOM stocks current dividend yield of just 34 uninspiring especially considering its five and 10year CAGRs of just  respectively When you consider that a riskfre,38,2023-10-12,0

467,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,562,2023-09-17,0

478,Chevron Is Better Than Cenovus,I had to stretch to rate Cenovus  a Hold in my last Seeking Alpha article see  But I shouldnt have I should have gone with what IThe investment thesis for the oil sands producers is relatively simple and straightforward Before the era of shale oil ie lightsweet crude US refiners assumed that they would be heavily dependent on heavy crude imports from Venezuela and OPEC for many years into the future in order to meet domestic demand for gasoline diesel and distillates As a result they reconfigured their refineries to run a larger slate of heavy crude That slate included Canadian oil sands crude which were effectively landlocked with pretty much all export capacity going south to its energyhungry neighbor the US Indeed Phillips 66  imports more Canadian oil sands crude than any other company and as a result has a generally higher distillates yield vs its peersToday of course growing US shale production has overwhelmed domestic lightsweet refining capacity and pretty much all the incremental production increases of shale are now being exported Indeed according to RBN Energy see  US crude oil exports are currently running at 4 million bpd with the vast majority being shale barrels and a relatively small percentage originating from Canada in the form of WCSThis is that many analysts  and especially politicians on the right  dont understand when they say America is no longer energy independent They point to US foreign oil imports and somehow reach the conclusion that America is not energy independent when just the opposite is true America is the largest oil producer on the planet became the No 1 LNG exporter on the planet last year and is the No 1 overall petroleum producer in the world What these politicians and analysts dont seem to understand is that the American refining industry is all about efficiencies and optimizing your feedstock to run as profitably as possible given the configuration of your refinerySo Canada has a ready market for a large portion of its heavy crude production and any leftover can potentially be exported from the US Gulf Coast as most all of it shown in the graphic above in pink was However US refiners pretty much have all they want and need So its not a big growth market For growth the oil sands producers  including Cenovus  have put all their organic production growth hopes in the Trans Mountain pipeline which last I knew is scheduled to go online early next year with an extra 590000 bpd of badly needed and long overdue oil sands exit capacity see Meantime Cenovus best asset might well be the WRB 5050 refining joint venture it has with Phillips 66 WRB stands for Wood RiverBorger two refineries that are owned and operated by Phillips 66 The distributions from this partnership are likely what kept Cenovus out of bankruptcy back when the oil sands glut in western Canada had the CEO  the one they hired after the one they fired for making the big oil sands acquisition from ConocoPhillips   running to the government for production cut mandates In retrospect its quite humorous to consider what a novel idea that was A CEO of a North American energy company asking the government for a production  mandate Regardless the point is  as I have been saying on Seeking Alpha for years  the best way to play the oil sands is not through the oil sands producers Its through the refinersFrom a big picture perspective the slide below from Cenovus  summarizes the companys assetsAs you can see from the graphic Cenovus is very much an oil sands centric producer 76 of production and has upgrading ie to WCS and refining capacity thats roughly in line with its production 248000 bpd with WRB alone The company has a very large oil sands 3P asset base ie bitumen with a reserves life of threeplus decadesChevron on the other hand has a global asset base thats much more diversified and in,153,2023-08-23,0

480,Chevron: Surprising But Delightful Deal For Hess Announcement,  surprised investors and markets with a landmark announcement  with details on a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of   in anIn my opinion there are quite a few aspects to like about the Chevron Hess deal most notably Chevrons willingness to strengthen its footprint in the fossil fuel market Oil investors vs ESG believers have long debated whether a strategy that focuses on fossil fuels or alternative energies is more value accretive on equity In the past few years on the backdrop of a surge in energy prices I think this debate may be preliminarilyOver the past 5 years both Exxon and Chevron have outperformed European Shell  BP  and TotalEnergies TTE TTFNF who are broadly considered champions for the ESG transitionThat said on a less bullish energy transition strategy Chevron shares are valued at a higher earnings multiple than peers This is somewhat perplexing as the implied fundamental headwind from fossil fuels being phased out would in theory suggest a lower PE multiple on negative growthAs I see it Chevrons acquisition of Hess is set to significantly fortify Chevrons asset base with fossil fuels capturing production expansion opportunities in Guyana In more detail Chevron is poised to benefit from Hesss 30 ownership stake in more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil equivalent resources in the region In addition Hesss Bakken assets comprising 465000 net acres of highquality longterm inventory strengthen Chevrons position in the US shale sector The complementary assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the steady free cash flow generated from the Southeast Asia natural gas business further augment Chevrons strategic fitOn CAPEX the combined entity is expected to maintain a capital expenditures budget ranging from 19 to 22 billion indicating an efficient allocation of resources Furthermore with a strengthened portfolio postclosure Chevron anticipates an increase in asset sales generating an estimated 10 to 15 billion in beforetax proceeds through 2028 On OPEX the transaction is anticipated to achieve runrate cost synergies of approximately 1 billion before taxes within a year of closingChevron investors will certainly like that the Hess deal is paid for by allshares and is thus not binding valuable cash that may be up for shareholder distributions According to the  Chevron will pay over 1025 shares of its own stock in exchange for each of their Hess sharesAgainst the backdrop of the transaction Chevrons leadership is confident in its ability to enhance free cash flow growth through 2028 And to underscore the confidence Chevron has shared intentions to share more of its financial success with shareholders This commitment includes plans to recommend an 8 increase in the firstquarter dividend per share Furthermore Chevron plans to augment share repurchases by 25 billion bringing it to the upper limit of its guidance range of 20 billion per year especially in scenarios where oil prices outperform expectationsOverall the Hess transaction does look like a transaction that focuses on the bottom line aiming to capture a larger chunk of the value in oil on high energy prices Accordingly if investors believe that oil prices will remain higher for longer then it is hard to dismiss the merits of the dealIn that context investors should consider that throughout 2023 the global economy has exhibited notable resilience far exceeding initial forecasts of an impending recession As a result there continues to be an unexpectedly heightened appetite for oil while the OPEC alliance has chosen to curtail oil production In late Q2 the alliance declared the extension of their selfimposed oil supply reductions collectively amounting to approximately 13 million barrels per day And needless to say the recently surfaced tensions in the Middle East will only further strengthen the price of oil as evidenced by Brent,23,2023-10-23,0

498,Why I Believe $200 Oil Could Be In The Cards,Oil traders and analysts seem to underestimate the IsraelHamas war and its consequences for the worlds economy Indeed neither Israel nor the Gaza Strip have substantial oil reserves but there are not only two sides to the conflict The war is getting moreI have been bullish on oil for a while  on the subject wasThe map below was prepared by  The countries supporting Palestine in the conflict are marked in orange whilst the militias are marked with red dotsAs concerns Saudi Arabia initially wanted  with Israel However as  escalated between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas the SaudiIsrael deal went on ice Moreover Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a telephone call with Iran Israels opponent in the conflict to discuss the situation Simultaneously Saudi Arabia is calling both sides of the conflict to peace and is trying to find a solution In order to achieve this Saudi Arabia and the UAE met to discuss the war  Iran could be involved in the conflict This could affect the Gulf countries national security That is why they have been pressing Western allies and Israel to deescalate tensions in Gaza and lift a siege on the strip in my viewHere comes the biggest risk to the oil markets Iran  nations has shown strong support to Palestine It is highly likely to get involved in the conflict if the war intensifies Yes right now Iran is not having a war with Israel However Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein AmirAbdollahian  settlement of the situation in the Gaza Strip is becoming highly unlikely and warned Iran may take  against Israel The minister also added the country did not initially plan to engage in a military conflict with Israel if Tel Aviv did not strike Iranian territory At the same time Iran may  if Israel launches a ground operation in the Gaza Strip  the latter seems to be inevitableMoreover  with Hezbollah the military group located in Lebanon Hezbollah has vowed to escalate if Israel begins a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip which is likely and Israel said it would retaliate  The point I am making is that the situation in the Middle East might get more complicatedThe situation is not new The IsraelHamas conflict comes 50 years after the Yom Kippur War  the fourth of the ArabIsraeli wars was initiated by Egypt and Syria on 6 October 1973 on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur After that on  immediately after President Nixons request for Congress to make available 22 billion in financial help to Israel the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries OAPEC implemented an oil embargo on the US and started cutting their oil production This made the global oil prices surge nearly fourfold The prices rose from 290 a barrel before the embargo to 1165 a barrel in January 1974 In March 1974 amid disagreements within OAPEC on how long to continue the punishment the embargo was officially lifted The oil prices however still remained highI believe something similar might actually happen now Although I doubt OPEC may implement an oil embargo a potential war between Israel and Iran may lead to massive supply cuts As can be seen from the map above Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz also known as the Gulf The Gulf is used to transport oil coming from the Middle East most notably from countries like Saudi Arabia Iraq UAE and Qatar If there is a fullscale war Iran might well close the Strait of Hormuz for all ships Unfortunately there are limited options to bypass the Gulf Moreover the very fact that there is a war in one country in the Middle East can disrupt oil production in the neighboring countries Nowadays missiles are fired and infrastructure gets destroyed So there is a big risk as wellYou might be wondering why I say that such a high oil price is well possible But let us have a look at the history of oil prices in generalThe diagram below shows the oil prices adjusted for inflation If before the Yom Kippur War th,26,2023-10-24,0

502,The Saudis Are Dead Serious On Pushing Oil Prices Higher,In the years Ive followed the oil market I have never seen the Saudis this determined to push oil prices up This includes the whatever it takes moment we saw in 2017 when the previous Saudi energy minister Khalid AlFalih started targetingSaudi crude exports for the first 24 days of August are averaging at the lowest level since June 2020 At 53 million bd Saudis will have reduced crude exports by 1 million bd since July Now we dont expect this figure to be final Crude exports for the upcoming week are showing a rebound so final figures could be closer to 56 to 58 million bdBut that doesntThose of you who follow us closely will know that our base case view is for the Saudis to extend the voluntary cut into yearend We explained that its because of the logistical timing issue of when exports hit physical inventories and the impact on market sentiment But with the latest Saudi crude export figure I cant help but wonder if the cut will likely be extended into Q1 of 2024Let me explainHere is IEAs assumption for global oil supply  demand balance into the end of 2024 Out of all of the IEA reports weve read to date the August OMR was the most balanced surprisingNow you will notice that both Q1 and Q2 of 2024 show stockbuilds Keep in mind that the IEA is not assuming the voluntary cut of 1 million bd into its balance in 2024 Instead it is assuming that the Saudis will continue its original 500k bd voluntary cutIn my view the Saudis played this one beautifully By keeping it on a monthtomonth basis it deters speculators from bidding up the long end of the curve and keeps the market at bay The monthtomonth action also prevents speculators from frontrunning prices which prevents any potential risk of demand destruction amidst a weakening global economy Instead the voluntary cut does the sole purpose it was meant to do reduce global inventoriesSo now imagine this scenario as we approach the end of October oil continues to trade in the range of 80 to 90 While global oil inventories have drained materially sentiment remains weak and speculators believe the impending recession will hurt oil demand Saudis are now deciding whether to extend to the end of December but as they look at global oil supply  demand balances Q1 shows a build All of the efforts of the voluntary cut up to that point would be pointless if storage gets to build back up againWith the voluntary cut already in place whats to stop the Saudis from slowly unwinding the cut Perhaps its best to after Q1 to slowly unwind the 1 million bd cut as to avoid any inventory buildup In addition with Russia cooperating finally and if the Russians extend their voluntary cut into yearend then its physically very difficult for Russia to increase production during the heart of winter All of these things suggest to me that it is better than 50 chance that the Saudis extend this voluntary cut in some form or shape into the end of Q1 and possibly Q2 of 2024Now this is not the consensus view and many of the oil analysts expect the Saudis to unwind the voluntary cut once the storage draw has materialized but we digress We think the ultimate goal for the Saudis is price stability so if that implicitly implies a lower overall storage level to achieve this then the Saudis will keep the voluntary cut until they see fitThis means that Brent would have to easily average over 90 for many months before the Saudis contemplate a reduction We just dont see that when the consensus expects a build in Q1In the years Ive followed the Saudis this is the most determined Ive ever seen them If we are right and the Saudis continue to extend then the market will get a rude awakening Global onshore crude inventories are already starting to accelerate to the downside and theres more to come Perhaps like the article we published on Monday it is really just that straightforward Perhaps it is not We will know wit,296,2023-08-26,0

510,The Bullish Case For Oil,It has been a while since I have posted on Seeking Alpha I took a few years offAs an introduction since my last stint writing for Seeking Alpha I have become a believer in whatIn its early days bitcoin was viewed as a speculative asset that would likely go the way of the Holland tulip craze but now its been almost a decade and a half and bitcoin is still going strong And given everything that is happening in the world we can all agree that bitcoin has a real use case as a store of value safe from corruption Given that bitcoin will continue to exist and likely thrive what this makes possible for oil and gas companies has not yet been realized This and other trends discussed below will provide strong tailwinds for the oil and gas industry in the immediate future as well as for generations to come in my opinionBitcoin is and will continue to increasingly be a gamechanger for the oil and gas industry Right around 2021 some oil companies including the granddaddy of them all   began to explore the possibilities and the improved economics that bitcoin can bring to their oil and gas operations How were they going to use bitcoin to improve individual well economics Bitcoin mining Bitcoin mining allows these companies to connect any excess energy received at the wellhead to an energy generator whether that be natural gas or natural gas liquids and generate energy that is able to power computers to mine bitcoin This creates an immediate market for natural gas that was otherwise be uneconomical to connect to a pipeline and ship to market As a result the excess natural gas was flared or simply burned at the wellhead Thanks to bitcoin there is a readily available market for natural gas right at the wellhead which will inevitably increase profitability for companies who utilize this technologyAs more and more companies develop bitcoin mining operations it will force other companies to do the same in order to remain competitive in the marketplace This will be a multidecade trend that already has and will continue to create a bullish trend across various industries That is my first bullish catalyst for the oil and gas industry There are certainly governmental risks to this bullish catalyst but any government policy that gets passed against bitcoin mining will have no merit other than the fact that bitcoin and digital proofofwork currencies threaten the status quoSince Americas founding in 1776 it has continually risen to become one of the most industrialized nations in the world In fact the very year that America was founded a Scotsman named James Watt invented a steam engine that was 75 percent more efficient than any previous steam engine This was a gamechanger for the use of the steam engine in industrial applications and ultimately led to another phase in the Industrial Revolution that was already taking place And for those who dont know the Latin word for energy is IndustriaWhen James Watt invented the steam engine it unleashed a new era where people could begin using stored energy in the form of fossil fuels to create products and enable them to make labor less laborious The same thing is happening today except with money Today we are entering an age where energy isnt just used to create products and services but is now being used to create the very thing that will someday be used as money digital proofofwork currencies This in my view is incredibly bullish for the oil and gas industry at this stage of developmentMy second bull case is the climate change narrative Whether you are a believer in climate change or not and I suspect most are not the narrative is being pushed by the deepest pockets in the world The largest holding companies in the worldand we all know who they are are funneling and pressuring companies to take part in their ESG initiatives  In my opinion this is clearly a political ploy as companies like Tesla  who one would think should recei,31,2023-08-16,0

513,BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,How does BHP Group Limited  one of the largest diversified mining companies globally fit into an energy investment thesisDespite the exceptional 20212022 runup energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities  particularly among stocks withThat in a nutshell is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too However I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand Perhaps emerging economies like India INDA manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs  or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughsI personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities For example cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an environmentally conscious voter base In either case for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even netzero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this This naturally points to the mining industry as a hedge if oil gets phased out faster  and within mining BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resourcesBHPs mining portfolio has shifted over the years but after the  to Woodside  currently the group focuses on the If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker it has to consume a lot more of BHPs products at least in the next few decades to build out the new infrastructure that would support a lowcarbon economy Mining itself is very energy intensive so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels but lets assume thats only a shortterm effect and in the longrun net fossil fuel use will still dropBHP is certainly not the only miner out there but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand outBHPs yeartodate return is a negative 72 but lets be clear  the only reason for this years underperformance are fears over Chinas economy Yet the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors China sentiment may have bottomed The markets are also forward looking so commodity futures and BHPs stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving As much as China remains the main risk the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higherThe short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything The Tesla  in your garage only substitutes one type of nonrenewable resource for a different one Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply To the IEAs credit their  entitled Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions tried to quantify these exact megatrendsThe IEA distinguishes between a stated policies scenario STEPS associated with a slower energy transition and a sustainable development scenario or SDS which implies even faster decarbonization The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels by resource typeCopper demand of relevance to BHP is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x depending on how quickly the energy transition moves In 2020 the world,33,2023-10-08,0

522,APA Corporation: Permian Upside And Undervalued Production,APA Corporation  the holding company for what many recognize as Apache ResourcesCorp is an oil and gas exploration company with a market cap of 13 billionThe company is led by CEO John Christmann who has been the CEOThe companys history dates back to December 1954 in Minneapolis Minnesota where it was founded The three founders last name initials interestingly created the three letters APA its ticker symbol Throughout its history itThe company is diversified geographically Here are its areas of operations Its American operations like many companies are primarily focused in the Permian BasinTheir global operations are divided between production in the North Sea and Egypt Currently the company has what they believe is an exciting project that is located off the shore of Suriname which sits two countries to the east of VenezuelaAs of 2023 the company produced 325 Mboeday Heres a look at its annual cash flows Just by looking at its record of operating cash flows one can see how the company has struggled to grow their cash flow from operationsI believe that the worst is behind the company and that their cash flows will begin to grow However I think the company still has an uphill road to climb thanks to their balance sheet Below we will examine their production growth to understand how their cash flows have been affect by thatThis slide shows how their capital expenditures are divided between their different areas of focus with most of their focus being in the United StatesThe company plans to return a portion of its free cash flows to shareholders going forward Its current goal is to return at least 60 percent of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases Since 2021 the company has been able to execute on this goalThe company has suffered through 2021 with its oil production For the first time in five years the company began to see growth in production in 2022 Sometimes companies reach a point or size where it becomes difficult to grow production It is only common sense that all else being equal we should want to invest in companies with production growthHere I will try to make a rough prediction on where oil production is headed for the fullyear 2023 On its Q2 presentation the company claimed to be producing 399 thousand BOE per day of which roughly 50 percent is oil That means they are producing 199 thousand barrels of oil per day This is a rough estimate but if we multiply 199 thousand times 365 days in a year we calculate that they will be producing a total of roughly 72 million barrels of oil for the year Given the oil production declines from previous years this should be very welcome news to investors Im not going to make the same calculation for NGLs and Natural Gas but each of these should follow along with oil productionIn their 2Q report the company stated that most of the production growth is coming from strong results in Egypt and the PermianThe companys balance sheet has been on an interesting path Again we can see that there were some significant writedowns in 2020 which brought its balance sheet assets pretty much right inline with its total liabilities Given that oil prices have rebounded from 2020 the companys assets would likely be valued much higher than their balance sheet currently represents That said the company is focused on debt reduction while maintaining dividends and some occasional share buybacksThe company has quite a long and varied debt schedule In the past year alone they have begun to put a dent in some of their higher interest debt They were able to do this through some asset sales over the past year to two yearsSource APA 2022 10KThe company has maintained its shares outstanding relatively level The company did a restructuring in 2021 which changed its number of shares I wasnt able to find the number of shares outstanding following the restructuring but in 2022 the company had 418 millio,32,2023-08-07,0
523,Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at 595B This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang the market didnt seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes transaction costs or asymmetric information about managements intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the companys future investment opportunities For example one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musks company isnt known for paying dividends but the market rightly or wrongly puts a very high value on its investment opportunitiesThe Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified Investors pay taxes and transaction costs a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining managements ability to invest in negative present value projects Last but not least many individual and institutional investors simply need current income You could theoretically generate income from a nondividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costsIn practice companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities  You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of managements confidence in the stability of the business Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isnt obliged to maintain them in bad yearsImportantly a very high dividend  or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage  doesnt by itself make for a good dividend stock If anything leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project The dividend may also be at risk of being cut ie the stock may be a dividend trapAt the end of the day oil  gas is a cyclical industry and producers cant control the price of their output For this reason large US independents like Marathon Oil  APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividendsExxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays but its still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staplesIt depends on your time horizon Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter  Gamble However a nice  dividend growth series doesnt mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from 250 to 250 The financial leverage also tends to yoyo a bitUnsurprisingly the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if youre a buyandhold investor though I would say yes Even if you never sell any stocks you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever To illustrate this point I ran a backtest that assumes you started with 1000 in January 2001 and invested another 1000 each month thereafter all the way through September 2023 I compared Exxon to PG as a typical consumer staples company and to Devon  as a more risky upstream player I assume,14,2023-10-24,0

527,Enterprise Products Partners: One Of The Better Dividend Payers In The Space,If you are looking for a dividenddistributing company that has perhaps some of the most solid margins in the energy sector then a top pick of mine is Enterprise Products Partners LP  right now TheEPD serves as a vital player in the midstream energy sector providing essential solutions to producers and consumers in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids segments Moreover the company extends its reach into other critical sectors such as crude oil petrochemicals and refined products This diverse operational scope is structured into four distinct segments NGL Pipelines  Services Crude Oil Pipelines  Services Natural Gas Pipelines  Services and Petrochemical  Refined Products ServicesThe last for the company showcased strength as the DCF remained high at 17 billion There were fewer favorable commodity prices in the last quarter as compared to Q2 FY2022 But that hasnt stopped EPD from still being a strong dividend distributorThe company has managed to accelerate the total asset growth of the business and over the last decade it has averaged a  If this can be maintained as a result of acquiring more companies and yield pipeline expansion then I think EPD looks very attractive as an investment But it wont be just expansion that will result in higher valued assets The fact that they already have the assets and the necessity for natural gas and crude oil growth each year is sufficient enough to result in it growing tooAs for how EPD has been able to leverage this into stronger earnings I think that they have done a great job as commodity prices of both oil and gas have appreciated in the last couple of years Both seem to be trending upwards as well and production cuts are resulting in higher pricesEven though there is a general sentiment that renewables are going to make up a larger portion of energy generation EPD is still investing quite heavily in  related to oil and gas pipelines Approved and underdevelopment projects have a total value of 41 billion so far Looking ahead several projects are expected to be in service as of 2024 and 2025 which supports the prospects of growing distributable cash flows as EPD expands the asset baseEven as the company has been growing its FCF over the years the relation between it and the price has been declining EPD still posts a premium in pfcf in comparison to the sector of about 5213 on a FWD basis I dont think that should construed as the buy case here though EPD is still a very appealing company to be in given the reliable dividend it has maintained through the years that is what investors and the market are valuing On a pe basis it looks a little more realistic as it trades more or less in line with the broader sector median right now EPD still equals a buy in my book primarily because of the dividend yield of over 7 and the fact there are still several ongoing projects in the pipeline that further solidify the position of the company in the marketsI think that for EPD the dividend remains incredibly stable as we will see below the FCF of the business has been incredibly stable throughout the commodity cycle of oil for example With the last quarter having 17 billion in distributable cash flows it more than covers the TTM dividends paid of 41 billion on an annualized basisVolume elves remain stable for the company and I think this underscores the capability the company inhabits to possibly post even stronger earnings in the coming quarters If commodity prices keep ticking upwards going into the colder months of the year I think EPD is ripe to post higher distributable cash flows then the previous 17 billion Over the last 24 years the dividend has been raised and this would add more support to that practice and let EPD perhaps continue doing it for another 24 years as long as they maintain this fortress of assets they have accumulatedEPDs unitholders are exposed to a significant risk factor that arises from the company,38,2023-10-29,0

541,How Devon Energy Positioned Itself For Growth,The first individual company I will be covering in my return to writing on Seeking Alpha is Devon Energy Devon Energy is a company with an extremely rich history as it was the company that brokeFor the past decade since 2009 Devon Energy has wisely reversed course and is on a much better trajectory today This reversal in its strategy was gradual with each eventual asset sale and new oilfocused acquisition however the moment that it began was in the heart of the 2009 market crash Below I will cover some of the acquisitions and changes Devon Energy made following the 2009 Great Recession as I think it is important to understand and appreciate the massive transformation Devon Energy underwent As you read my writings you will notice that I always touch upon history In my mind if you dont understand the history of a company then how are you going to know the future of the company You can read my  here where I also touch on history slightlyBefore we cover Devons transformation first lets look at the historical price charts Notice the path that Devons share price has taken relative to natural gas prices in the two charts below For twelve years from 2009 to 2012 Devon has been treated like a natural gas company while it tried to transform itself into an oilshale company And I would say they were successfulI realize my price chart could be a little more technical with candlesticks and trendlines and such but for those who appreciate technical analysis I believe Devon Energy just completed a giant twelveyear falling wedge pattern where it followed natural gas prices And in technical analysis the larger the falling wedge the greater potential size and length of time of the breakout Not only have natural gas prices experienced a breakout following 202021 but Devon Energy is no longer weighted to natural gas like it once wasIn November 2009 Devon Energy announced that they would be selling their Gulf of Mexico assets Then immediately following in December they sold a portion to Maersk Oil and Gas for 13 billion Then in March 2010 the company sold the remainder of its Gulf of Mexico assets to BP  for 7 billion strengthening the companys balance sheet And one month later the company sold all of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf assets to Apache for 105 billion When the history books of Devon Energy are written November 2009 should be marked as a strong turning point for the companyThe transition continued when they made a major asset sale to Linn Energy in April 2014 for 23 billion Two years later in May 2016 Linn Energy went bankrupt providing confirmation that their larger strategy of offloading natural gas assets was intelligent in my viewImmediately following the sale to Linn Energy the company made a major acquisition in the Eagle Ford Shale by buying GeoSouthern Energy for 61 billion From there they continued making acquisitions that were more focused on oil as opposed to natural gas shaleAs I review Devon Energys transformation over the twelve years from 2009 to 2021 it is very impressive what they were able to accomplish First their management along with Mitchell Energys management should be commended for the technological advancements they unleashed in the Barnett Shale however their discoveries caused them to become myopic in my opinion Instead they should have been studying the market and trying to apply this same technology to oil shale Unfortunately their shareholders paid the price from 2009 to 2021 for this mistake However they should be strongly commended for their aggressive course correction and I believe the company is set up to perform very well over the next six to seven yearsDevon Energys strategic merger with WPX Energy completed in January 2021 bookended their twelveyear slide and was a wise move given the companys complimentary portfolios and the fact that Devon Energy was headquartered in Oklahoma City and WPX was headquartered in T,68,2023-08-17,0

543,Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),Over most of the past year I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads I  my longterm bullish take on MarathonHowever as discussed more recently  Ive downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash  in the crack spread As such it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon considering its stock remains generally high However its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopoliticalrelated production cuts Overall investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum depending on how we calculate its forward valuationFor the most part refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly My longterm view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today That said the shortterm outlook has changed as volatility mounts raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022 However oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around 87 per barrel today Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil  Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped Marathon has retained much of its value but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income The crack spread is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs crude oil has crashed particularly for the gasoline spread See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profitLuckily Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of 32barrel to 19barrel today That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above All else being equal this 12barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of 1296 annualized 324B quarterly  have only changed marginally over this period Natural gas has also hardly changed so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathons refining marginsThe company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023 However this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathons current EBITDA See belowHistorically Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around 15 depending on changes in other operating costs Today that spread is below its typical range before COVID19 indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around 15B per quarter from its Midstream segment In comparison its refining margins can vary from negative  seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage Its refining segment EBITDA was 316B in Q2 and may be as low as 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant Combined with an expected 15B from Midstream I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at 142B given limited changes in commodity prices and volumesMarathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the  I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the ,13,2023-10-09,0

555,I Might Double My Pioneer Natural Resources Investment - Again,I doubt its a surprise to any of my regular readers when I say that Ive been bullish on oil for a while In this case I turned bullish on oil in 2020 as I expected a significant shift in supply andEssentially my thesis has been tightening supply growth and consistent longterm demand growth The end of the US shale revolution OPEC cutting output to protect 80 Brent and geopolitical risks are putting a floor under oil pricesEven the mighty Permian basin in the United States which is the only driver of unconventional oil supply growth is now losing steamThe most recent report showed that declines in legacy production are now more than offsetting production gains from new wells  natural gas remains in an uptrendIf we get peak productionThis is what longterm oil demand might look likeTo prepare for such a scenario I have bought 19 energy exposure which I expect to increase even furtherIm not rooting for elevated inflation I just want to be prepared After all if Im right we could see a development that is negative for the market in general This would also apply to a lot of my other holdingsThe chart below reinforces my view as investments in oil supply remain well below levels that would support rising demand growth This is inflationary especially if demand comes roaring backGiven the shift in supply dynamics I believe that upstream oil companies the ones that drill for oil are the best way to get the job doneIn this case I focus onOne company that checks all boxes is On May 14 I wrote an  titled Thats exactly what I did as the company now accounts for more than 53 of my portfolioIn this article I went with a bullish title again as I want to consolidate my energy holdings Im looking to shift some money from Chevron  into PXD purely because I prefer its aggressive shareholder distribution plansWhile I havent made a final decision on the CVX to PXD shift Ill also deploy new capital as I believe I need to own more oilAnd what better way to buy oil than via PXDSo lets dive into the detailsWith a 55 billion market cap PXD is one of Americas largest onshore oil producers In the second quarter the company produced roughly 370 thousand barrels of oil per day It also produced 341 thousand barrels 48 of equivalentIt has a 05x net leverage ratio with a BBB credit ratingThe company exclusively produces its oil in the Permian basin where it achieved industryleading efficiencyFor example the company not only achieved higherthanexpected production in the second quarter but it is also capable of boosting output with subdued CapExIn the second quarter the company raised its production guidance for the year while reducing the capital budget allocated to drilling completions and facilitiesThe oil production guidance midpoint is now 369 thousand barrels of oil per day and the revised drilling completions and facilities capital budget is 125 million lower than the initial 2023 outlookThis adjustment was attributed to the efficient execution of wellproductivity and operational activities by its teams leading to a more capitalefficient programThe companys investment framework remains aligned with moderate annual production growth of up to 5Furthermore the companys 2023 average well productivity significantly surpassed both 2022 and 2021 levels over the first 24 months of productionAccording to the company its focus on fullstack development enhances longterm recovery and optimizes returnsEssentially the companys substantial inventory of lowbreakeven highmargin locations positions it favorably compared to peers With roughly 15000 toptier locations Pioneer believes it is set for bestinclass development in the years to comeWhile it isnt visible in the chart below the company has more than 20 years worth of toptier drilling which surpasses any of its major peersBut wait the good news continuesThe company is also getting better acces,72,2023-08-29,0

562,Cautiously Bullish Oil,For the most part indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish  as they have been for much of this yearOn the term structure front both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports reduced production of Saudi heavysour crudes which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline and a number of other factors the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardationMeanwhile WTI calendar spreads represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole The EIAs historically noisy estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen Regardless the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at presentWe can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above as well as looking at refined product crack spreads As we can see below gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firmClearly the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand sideSuch dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline or to reduce runs thus reducing the amount of crude they consume This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market After all refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oilThus all else equal unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the 95100 area in the near future particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lowerThough as we have seen outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic with the DubaiBrent spread a proxy for AsiaChina oil demand continuing to trend lower overall and near parityWhile the various AfricaBrent crude oil differentials also remain strong This is an important relationship to track as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell offWhile the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September Indeed if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages the picture has now turned unfavourable as we are seeing far more builds than drawsIn terms of commercial inventory levels overall total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages as do diesel stocks The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present For me to once again become uber bullish though I remain cautiously bullish persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the normIn terms of the outlook for supply and demand consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4 though to a lesser extent prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024 Although such forecasts are fu,4,2023-10-23,0

567,Oil Price Mini-Crash Is A Gift For Investors,With the market fixated on bond yields with the 30year and 10year Treasury Rate approaching 50 the bigger story right now is likely the minicrash in crude oil prices few expected Indeed WTI crude oil  isThe selloff here likely reflects the combination of some softer economic indicators along with a building The sense is that a rush by producers worldwide including Russia to take advantage of elevated prices on the supply side is coming up against some softer demandThe setup here has some major implications not only for inflation expectations and the direction of interest rates but also represents a positive development for the stock market Our article here reaffirms a bullish view of theThe first point here is that its becoming less and less likely the Fed will need to hike rates again this year This is confirmed by the  tool tracking the marketimplied probability at 64 that the Fed Funds rate will now end the year flat from the current level of 55 On the other hand the odds for another rate hike in 2023 have dropped to 36 compared to 47 just yesterdayConsidering it was the run in energy prices that ruffled the hawkish feathers suggesting to some that inflation was set to accelerate the correction in oil turns that view upside down Our confidence that the Fed wont hike again has been strengthenedLooking ahead to the September CPI report set to be released on October 12 the market can focus more on the core measures that exclude volatile energy prices On this point the trends have been much more favorable and confirm the disinflationary process is well underwayThe annual core CPI hit 43 in the last August update with the more dynamic threemonth annualized measure at a very mundane 24 What we have here is evidence that the Feds strategy is working and further rate hikes are unnecessary for the headline rate to converge towards the target 20 down the lineWith a building consensus that inflationary pressures are easing the next step is to see a downside to interest rates and bond yields There are many ways to interpret the yield curve Its fair to say that a large part of the recent spike in rates reflects a concern that inflation was set to remain elevated and the Fed would need to at least hold rates for longerIf we can agree that the price of oil is going to remain relatively contained around the current level for the foreseeable future longterm rates can be limited to the upsideComments by Chairman Powell at the September Fed meeting opened the door but did not commit to another hike urging a sense of caution We know the Fed is datadependent and the takeaway here is that with the latest drop in oil prices the data that matters looks pretty good on the inflation frontThe bullish case for bonds considers a scenario where the CPI trends lower faster than expected opening the door for the Fed to cut earlier rather than later into 2024Importantly this could occur even as economic conditions remain resilient in a soft landing environment because inflation expectations anchored to the target level would justify such a move and not because the economy is collapsingBy removing that headwind of surging oil prices which was one factor contributing to the crash in the bond market spike in yields and climbing inflation expectations the setup for stocks gets a new tailwind of sentimentInvestors can start looking forward to the upcoming earnings season which gets underway later this month with all indications that companies captured a solid operating environment in Q3We see room for the SP 500 to climb right back to its recent highs of around 4600 as a yearend price target The environment of resilient economic conditions as interest rates stabilize while corporate earnings climb supports a bullish view We also expect the reset of inflation expectations lower based on the latest energy price correction to drive some short covering in both the stock and bond market as a n,25,2023-10-04,0

578,UAW Strike And Saudi Oil Cuts Are The Fed's New Inflation Nightmare,August CPI and retail sales numbers  this week signaling a new phase in the Feds battle to bring down inflation Adding fuel to the inflationary fire United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain has declared a simultaneous strike at theHonor trust and respect are key in some aspects of life Labor negotiations with Corporate America are not one of them All that matters with union negotiations is leverage Enter Shawn Fain bulldog leader for the United Auto Workers union Negotiations over the past year show that labor unions in key bottlenecks of the economy have been able to demand eyepopping deals with companies Airline pilots demanded and  the Teamsters grabbed a deal to push UPS  driver pay in five years and  and  have threatened strikes as well to renegotiate pay packages This ramps up the pressure on the UAW to go big or go home in its own negotiationsSo whats going on here with these huge pay increasesThe fact that major unions are demanding and getting large pay increases speaks to the amount of damage that has already been done to the purchasing power of workers In the 1970s in particular these kinds of wage demands led to inflation by creating whats known as a wageprice spiral Now its interesting to see these coming back in a big way including the UAWs  to price increasesThe UAW chose to begin by striking roughly 13000 workers here with the implicit threat that they can double down a couple of more times without depleting their strike fund Their tactics are sharp here because they can virtually guarantee that theyll cost General Motors  Ford  and Stellantis  billions of dollars in lost profits either way Its quite possible that the UAW could win the battle but lose the war as the Big 3 auto manufacturers are not the most competitive globally and have a poor track record of handling changeKey parts of the American manufacturing economy are not competitive with Mexico China and Eastern Europe As such unemployment should naturally be a good amount higher than it is now To keep this from happening in the post2008 world industry in the US and parts of Western Europe has been propped up by tax cuts subsidies and rockbottom interest rates Now inflation is taking this option away which is likely to lead to a more difficult process of reeducating and retraining workers to be competitive in the 21st century Elon Musks Tesla  is competitive globally but  than the union workers make and the unions are demanding a 40 raiseThe UAW striking here will directly increase inflation because theyre walking off the job when they would be making cars In the short run this means consumers are likely to have fewer choices of cars and will face higher prices This directly complicates the Feds inflation fight which has relied partly on used cars dropping to bring overall consumer prices back towards target Also notable is how poorly stocks have performed after getting crushed by unions in negotiations UPS stock is lagging the market by roughly 30 percentage points this year while American Airlines  is lagging by more than 10 with the flight attendant union looking for a new deal as well My guess with the automakers is that the union will get a surprisingly good deal or will strike long enough to punish the stocks anyway Im less certain that the UAW is prepared for the shift to electric cars many of which will be made overseas or in more employerfriendly jurisdictions like TexasThe Saudis are ramping up the pressure with supply cuts and its working Oil fell from its highs of around 120130 per barrel when the economy slowed last fall and stocks entered a bear market Now supply cuts have WTI oil back into the 90s One way to think about this is that the Biden administration wants oil as low as possible for the 2024 election and that the Saudis want it as high as possible The Saudis won the first round in 2021 and 2022 but the Biden administration won the secon,98,2023-09-17,0
579,Positive Momentum Is Accelerating For Oil,In our weekly US crude storage report we said that the market will likely overlook the crude build if product demand is strong This turned out to be correct with WTI now trading above 84bblLooking at the US weekly oil data positive momentum is starting to gain traction from all sides of the corners First US oil demand rebounded strongly with gasoline demand leading the wayImplied US oil demand on a 4week average basis is now above 2021 We have also seen improvement in distillate demand over the past few weeks which should calm fears about the slowdown in manufacturingOther oil which has outperformed since late last year continues to surge higher pushing total oil demand higher Jet fuel demand is also a bright spot this year with demand now moving ever closer to 2019Looking ahead we expect to see a small crude draw starting next week Crude exports are rebounding but crude imports remain elevated which has dampened the size of the drawHowever looking at the incoming crude exports and imports we see hefty draws for the remainder of August Couple this with additional SPR builds and we could easily see a scenario where US commercial crude storage drops to a 5year lowGiven that the market is forwardlooking oil prices will trade higher well in advance of the data coming out Looking at WTI time spreads the price action appears to confirm our forecastIf we are right about the crude draw then we should see WTI break above 8560 in short orderBut its not just the positive momentum we are seeing on the US side Looking at global data from Brent time spreads to onshore crude inventory changes all the signs are pointing to a healthier and stronger oil marketFor the first time this year things are looking stronger for the oil market Validation from both the demand data and the physical oil market gives us comfort that this rally is sustainable The Saudi and Russian voluntary cuts will go a long way in further tightening the market and if demand continues as is oil inventories will draw and prices will move even higherFor energy investors the 20142020 bear market has been incredibly brutal But as the old adage goes  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering  Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks If you are interested we can help    Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,62,2023-08-09,0

583,Oil Rallies On Middle East Tension,Following Hamas devastating attacks on Israel over the weekend and the retaliatory actions taken by Israel in Gaza it is no surprise that the oil market opened stronger thisIsrael is a very marginal oil producer and so recent developments will have little direct impact on oil supply However given the rising tension in the region and the risk that the conflict could spread market participants will remain nervous until there is a clear deescalationLooking at the medium to longer term there hasWhile oil fundamentals have not changed since these attacks it does not mean they wont There are reports that Iran helped Hamas plan the attacks and gave them the green light If this is proven to be true we could see the US an ally of Israel taking a tougher stance against Iran which could ultimately lead to a reduction in oil supplyThe US administration has taken a much softer approach to Iran in recent months when it comes to sanctions While US oil sanctions against Iran remain in place they have not been strongly enforced This is evident by the growth in Iranian oil supply over the course of this year Output has grown from around 25MMbblsd at the start of the year to around 3MMbblsd currently The softer approach from the US is likely due to concern over rising energy prices However it would be difficult to see the US maintaining this stance if Iran is connected to these attacks whether directly or indirectly Enforcing these sanctions more strictly would mean the potential loss of at least 500MbblsdThe implication of losing this supply would be that the global oil balance would be tighter throughout 2024 At the moment we are assuming Iranian supply remains in the region of 3MMbblsd through next year but clearly there is downside risk to this given recent developmentsIf this loss materialises the surplus we currently forecast in 1Q24 would largely disappear leaving the market roughly in balance early next year For the remainder of 2024 we would see deeper deficits particularly over 2H24 Under this scenario there would be some upside risk to our current Brent forecast of US90bbl for next yearWe do not expect OPEC to adjust their output policy as a result of recent developments However if we were to see significant strength in prices ie Brent trading above 100bbl there is a possibility that Saudi Arabia would start to unwind their additional voluntary supply cut of 1MMbblsd These are levels where the Saudis would start to become increasingly concerned over the potential for demand destruction The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,8,2023-10-09,0
