1,1,Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at 595B This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang the market didnt seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes transaction costs or asymmetric information about managements intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the companys future investment opportunities For example one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musks company isnt known for paying dividends but the market rightly or wrongly puts a very high value on its investment opportunitiesThe Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified Investors pay taxes and transaction costs a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining managements ability to invest in negative present value projects Last but not least many individual and institutional investors simply need current income You could theoretically generate income from a nondividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costsIn practice companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities  You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of managements confidence in the stability of the business Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isnt obliged to maintain them in bad yearsImportantly a very high dividend  or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage  doesnt by itself make for a good dividend stock If anything leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project The dividend may also be at risk of being cut ie the stock may be a dividend trapAt the end of the day oil  gas is a cyclical industry and producers cant control the price of their output For this reason large US independents like Marathon Oil  APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividendsExxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays but its still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staplesIt depends on your time horizon Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter  Gamble However a nice  dividend growth series doesnt mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from 250 to 250 The financial leverage also tends to yoyo a bitUnsurprisingly the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if youre a buyandhold investor though I would say yes Even if you never sell any stocks you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever To illustrate this point I ran a backtest that assumes you started with 1000 in January 2001 and invested another 1000 each month thereafter all the way through September 2023 I compared Exxon to PG as a typical consumer staples company and to Devon  as a more risky upstream player I assume,43,2023-10-15,8,0.9972,-0.24999998437500096
2,2,BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,How does BHP Group Limited  one of the largest diversified mining companies globally fit into an energy investment thesisDespite the exceptional 20212022 runup energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities  particularly among stocks withThat in a nutshell is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too However I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand Perhaps emerging economies like India INDA manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs  or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughsI personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities For example cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an environmentally conscious voter base In either case for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even netzero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this This naturally points to the mining industry as a hedge if oil gets phased out faster  and within mining BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resourcesBHPs mining portfolio has shifted over the years but after the  to Woodside  currently the group focuses on the If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker it has to consume a lot more of BHPs products at least in the next few decades to build out the new infrastructure that would support a lowcarbon economy Mining itself is very energy intensive so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels but lets assume thats only a shortterm effect and in the longrun net fossil fuel use will still dropBHP is certainly not the only miner out there but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand outBHPs yeartodate return is a negative 72 but lets be clear  the only reason for this years underperformance are fears over Chinas economy Yet the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors China sentiment may have bottomed The markets are also forward looking so commodity futures and BHPs stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving As much as China remains the main risk the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higherThe short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything The Tesla  in your garage only substitutes one type of nonrenewable resource for a different one Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply To the IEAs credit their  entitled Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions tried to quantify these exact megatrendsThe IEA distinguishes between a stated policies scenario STEPS associated with a slower energy transition and a sustainable development scenario or SDS which implies even faster decarbonization The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels by resource typeCopper demand of relevance to BHP is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x depending on how quickly the energy transition moves In 2020 the world,33,2023-10-08,6,0.9871,-0.14285713265306196

8,8,Transocean: Let's Do The Convertible Bond Math,I recently wrote about the improvement in Transoceans  credit prospects and what it could mean for the equityOne watch area that I identified were Transoceans convertible bondsAs I pointed out all convertibles are now in the money and this may imply up to 20 dilution for the equity holders Interestingly during the subsequent  RIGs management also emphasized this pointGiven we may now theoretically exit Q3 at northOne view is that everything is already priced in clearly the potential dilutive effect has been known since  when these bonds were issued From accounting perspective Transocean even records a liability associated with the moneyness of the exchange featureHowever what I want to show is that abstracting oneself away from what is or isnt priced in and just looking at the intrinsic value of the shares the exercise of the conversion options would potentially reduce this intrinsic value by 5 to 10 in most scenarios While not immaterial I think that 5 to 10 is small compared to the fundamental uncertainty over how much Transoceans underlying assets would be worth in say 2025In other words the conversion by itself shouldnt really change your bullish or bearish stance on the stock although shortterm buying opportunities could arise if the bondholders who avail themselves of the conversion option also seek to divest their newly minted shares Interestingly a corollary of the balance sheet mechanics is that if you are very bearish on Transocean the conversion should make you relatively more bullishFinally while in the long term the conversion could be a wash for the equity what is undisputable in my view is that it will be very bullish for the nonconvertible debt especially for the junior bonds which currently rank below the convertibles Despite the spread compression I described in my prior article these junior notes still offer an attractive yield for what at this point isnt that much riskA convertible bond can be seen as a combination of a straight bond and a call option on the equity We know from the theory that the early exercise of an option is never optimal but its not unusual that institutional factors may dictate otherwise For example distressed debt investors may rather get their money out and put it into another investment consistent with their mandate than retain longterm exposure to Transoceans equity As the conversion options are now deep in the money the primary driver for future bond gains would be the equity itselfInsider Perestroika already converted a lot of its debt in Q2 and this was already noted in a  from JuneNow that the 10Q is out we can also see the corresponding growth in the share countIf the remaining options get exercised this quarter going into the next quarter we are looking at a little more than 900 million outstanding sharesAs the conversion substitutes debt for equity the expected 20 dilution doesnt mean that the intrinsic value of the shares will drop by 20 too To quantify the effect we need to have a view on the fair value of the asset side of the balance sheetTo make things easy I am going to assume an average value of 450 million for the 27 active floaters As its an average youll have units such as the Titan and Atlas well above and older units below that mark I will assume zero value for the 12 stacked units If these assumptions dont seem reasonable to you dont worry I also ran a sensitivity analysis that shows how the impact of the conversion changes with the asset valuesGiven various estimates from offshore drilling earnings calls that suggest up to 1 billion cost for a newbuild I dont think 450 million is aggressive especially as I dont include any contracted backlog either In total my assumptions suggest fixed assets value of 1215 billion which is still below the latest net book value of 1692 billion Perhaps as additional reference point Deep Value Driller AS a company listed in Norw,97,2023-08-21,8,0.9962,0.33333329629630043

19,19,Borr Drilling: The Jack-Ups Orderbook Is At 20-Year Lows,Borr Drilling Limited  is a highly levered offshore driller that specializes in modern jackup rigs used for drilling in shallow waters I previously wrote about BORR in  when I opined on theThe strong performance has made BORR look like a momentum stockHowever I would contend that BORR remains a value play despite the runup The offshore services industry is in a secular bull market that has been unfazed by recessionary fears or even oil briefly falling into the 60s earlier this yearAs BORRs drilling contracts rerate meaning that legacy contracts at lower rates get replaced by new contracts at higherThe low valuation suggests there is much upside left and the returns to equity holders may be magnified by the high leverage especially as the debt gets gradually derisked I rate BORR a buyI cover the bull case for oilfield and in particular offshore services in greater detail in some of my recent macrooriented articlesTo make a long story short longcycle offshore plays underwent years of underinvestment from 20142021 as shortcycle US shale production had become the swing producer Offshore projects require multiple years to pay out so there is a lot of hesitancy to respond to price signals when shale may ramp up and balance the market before an offshore project has even reached productionAt this point it should be clear to everyone that shale is reaching its limits and is no longer quick to ramp up production when oil prices rise As I have argued already in the linked articles there is evidence many producers now require 60 oil to break evenIn contrast industry bellwether Schlumberger  now believes that As oil prices remain comfortably above 50 we have seen quite a rush by the advantaged operators to develop their reserves On the deepwater side Petrobras  has been a major driver behind rig demand while on the shallow water side where BORR plays there has been a lot of demand from Middle Eastern NOCs like Saudi Aramco and ADNOCEven within the US itself offshore shows stronger activity Based on last Fridays Baker Hughes  rig count US onshore rigs are 20 YoY while offshore is up 25 for the same periodUnfortunately for the offshore operators during the lean years of 20142021 many rigs were retired as the drillers couldnt afford to maintain them and many drillers had to undergo reorganization too resulting in further industry consolidationIt is not so easy to come up with newbuild rigs either This is especially true on the deepwater side where estimates of 1 billion are thrown around for a newbuild drillship but is also valid for jackups where the orderbook is at its lowest in 20 years as pointed out in BORRs recent Part of the reason is rising building costs and more expensive financing but shipyards are also backlogged with other orders such as LNG carriers So when demand rises but supply is constrained utilizations and day rates for the existing fleet go upThis is clearly very bullish for BORR especially as the company has a modern fleet average age of six years that is in even higher demand compared to older rigsThe only negative is that rigs are contracted longterm so BORR is still realizing revenue based on legacy contracts that were concluded at lower rates It will take some time for the rerating process to play out until the high rates we see today fully filter down to the bottom line For this reason focusing on 2023 or 2024 EBITDA here doesnt make as much sense and Seeking Alphas standardized valuation scores may be misleadingBORR believes that it can get close to 1 billion in EBITDA by 2026As a highlevel calculation 750 million certainly looks possible24 rigs x 175kd rate x 365 days x 95 utilization x 50 EBITDA margin  728mNote the companys calculation is a lot more detailed as it considers the phasing out of the legacy contractsAll this means the current enterprise value of 32 billion is only about 4x the EBITDA we co,8,2023-09-11,1,0.3716,-0.09090908264462885
20,20,Petrobras: Why Lula Is Not A Threat,Going forward there are reasons to be optimistic about Petrobrass performance Back in December I published an on the company in which I noted that the political fears that were spreading at that time due to the election of Brazilian President Lula were mostly overblown as it was unlikely that the company would be fully nationalized or be forced to cut its dividends entirely As youll see shortly all of those fears havent materialized and only strengthened my bullish thesis especially after Petrobras managed to generate revenues along with earnings above the 2021 levels while its stock appreciated by 40 since the time my latest article was publishedAt the same time even though the dividend policy was changed last month it didnt really make Petrobrass stock a less attractive investment Under the new policy Petrobras is going to distribute 45 of its FCF as dividends to its shareholders down from 60 before This is not that big of a deal when compared to other oil and gas majors from the United States or EuropeOn top of that theres also a possibility that the oil prices will remain at the current levels as is likely to stick with its policy of cutting oil production so that the oil prices remain relatively high This would make it possible for Petrobras to continue to generate decent profits and reward its shareholders along the way Add to all of this the fact that international investors are becoming more about Brazils economy and accelerate the amount of foreign direct investments into the country and it becomes obvious that Petrobras has more than enough opportunities to try and exceed expectations in the current environmentTherefore by at 4 times its earnings and less than 1 times its sales Petrobrass stock remains a solid stock to own especially when we compare it to its American peers Lets not forget that   and   trade at over 10 times their earnings and the only major reason why Petrobras is not trading at those multiples is the markets fear that political risks could be too high for now However as Ive explained earlier so far the Lula administration hasnt posed any threat to the company and is unlikely to disrupt the businesss operations anytime soon Thats why as institutional investors become more optimistic about Brazils future Petrobrass shares have more room for growth as there are no major reasons to think why the company shouldnt trade at multiples similar to its American peersOn top of all of this even though the company is unlikely to generate the same returns that it generated in 2022 in the foreseeable future due to the normalization of the oil market and the stabilization of oil prices there are to believe that revenues and profits will be above the 2021 levels in the following years Add to all of this the fact that oil prices are likely to slightly rebound in Q3 and Q4 while UBS a 20 dividend yield potential for 2024 and it becomes obvious that Petrobrass additional 10 upside from the current levels is more than justifiedThe world is in disarray and its time to build a portfolio that will weather all the systemic shocks that will come your way  offers you exactly that No matter whether you are a beginner or a professional investor this service aims at giving you all the necessary tools and ideas to either build from scratch or expand your own portfolio to tackle the current unpredictability of the markets and minimize the downside that comes with volatility and uncertainty  for a  today and see if its worth it for you  Bohdan Kucheriavyi andor BlackSquare Capital isare not a financialinvestment advisor broker or dealer HesItsTheyre solely sharing personal experience and opinion therefore all strategies tips suggestions and recommendations shared are solely for informational purposes There are risks associated with investing in securities Investing in stocks bonds options exchangetraded funds mutual funds and money market f,148,2023-08-31,3,0.9728,-0.05882352595155729

32,32,EOG Resources: A Dividend Grower Fracking Its Way To Higher Margins,EOG Resources  is one of the finest companies inThe company recently outperformed earnings expectations on August 4th But there are a few reasons why owning this stock seems like a complete nobrainer toI first recommended the stock two months ago on  The company has increased about 145 since then but I am confident that the firm remains a bargain The latest results have encouraged me that the firm is more than capable of continuing to outperform expectationsThe dividend isnt as strong as some peers However EOG is a grower not a shower Given the continually improving financials at the company and the fantastic cash flow growth this dividend growth presents a major opportunity for longterm shareholders There hasnt been the best activity on revisions but the persistent economic strength and building strength in oil and natural gas prices should support the mediumterm outlook for EOGThe three following factors are supporting oil prices going into the end of the yearNatural Gas has been having a prolonged period of low prices after the considerable spikes in the wake of the Ukraine War However some reasons should support natural gas demand in the short and medium termFurthermore EOG is a cash flow machine if you are a shareholder in the company you will participate They are ahead on their goals for the year which gives management some flexibility as we wrap up 2023 and oil prices firm up The firms quality assets and premium drilling innovation continue to deliver value to shareholders I am very comfortable with the firms strategy and I think this stock is excellent to own for those seeking compoundingThis firm demonstrates that its value proposition works but it has also bought itself staying power by being such a leader in costcutting technology Furthermore Natural Gass leading role in this firms economics makes me optimistic as this fossil fuel will play a central role in the Energy transitionThe deep discount compared to implied intrinsic value initially attracted me to EOG Resources in July As you can see below a lot of upside was implied when I recommended the stock two months ago Of course there has been a solid earnings report between now and thenBut there is still much room for the upside for this industry leader Even though the stock has increased 145 since then the upside remains significant because of the recent earnings beat The firms cash flow is ahead of schedule Also the firm has a rule of returning at least 60 of capital to shareholders So far this year it is well ahead of that goal having returned twothirds of capital so farAs you can see there is still a comparable amount of upside implied by the Growth Exit 5Y DCF model The strength of the companys approach and strict capital discipline is becoming apparent over time I think the excellent strategy and management team of proven executors will dovetail nicely with persistent economic strength and a supportive demand environment in oil and natural gasWhen moving to relative valuation it is clear that EOG enjoys a premium compared to some peers However its strong management and proven strategy justify the companys premium And while the company is undoubtedly immense it also is particularly effective compared to peers which usually results in a premium valuationDespite a strong price performance over the past two months I am confident this stock has a significant margin of safety It is undervalued by virtually every intrinsic measure and I think it is a relative bargain compared to peers when you consider recent strength in earningsEOG is particularly exposed to the oil price if it increases Crude makes up 80 of the companys intrinsic value although it has a vibrant natural gas segment and has been improving its product mix toward more profitable liquids While the Trefis model shows the stock slightly overvalued if I make slightly more favorable assumptions in EP margins and cru,30,2023-09-12,1,0.9995,0.6874999785156257
33,33,My View Of Wall Street: The Debt Issue,Is the debt of theEveryone has gotten so used to tossing around trillions they often lose their meaning and dont hit home until we add thatIt is important to understand however that sovereign debt is a little different than corporate or personal debt Global entities have more options when it comes to servicing and managing that debt particularly in the case of the US and its massive economy The government can issue more debt raise taxes attempt to monetize the debt by printing more money and deflating the currency and if all else fails they can seize and nationalize business and personal assets as a last resortThey can also cut spending to help bring the debt down over time but that is political suicide and makes it less likely for those politicians to get reelected Its a bipartisan issue too Both sides bear responsibility for the growing debt load and few running for office do so on a platform of taking things away from voters Hence the reason we are in this situation todayAs a result investment gurus such as Ray Dalio Stanley Druckenmiller and Charlie Munger among others have all sounded the alarm on the direction we are headed Munger last year even said that he believes the value of the US Dollar will go to zero within the next 100 years Im personally not losing sleep over that today These money managers are very familiar with the history and the destruction that too much debt eventually causes to nationstates If there is a nation that can buck that trend American exceptionalism suggests it would be the United States Warren Buffett has said that the US will never experience a debt crisis as long as that debt is issued in US dollars However he does caution against the runaway inflation it could produce and we have just witnessed that firsthand after the Covid giveaways At the moment those who refuse to acknowledge the situation go out kicking and screaming about cutting the giveaways will be fighting history and hoping that this time is differentStill it matters less what the credit rating agencies and these market legends think about the debt and more what the market thinks If the market and its investors collectively believe that the US debt remains the safest investment in the world and that they will receive their principal and interest then the recent Fitch downgrade isnt going to matter much in the grand scheme of things When I initially saw the downgrade news I thought that could start some to start thinking about and addressing the DEBT issues Yet all considered the overall reaction was rather muted It certainly wasnt like back in 2011 when Standard  Poors downgraded the US and the SP 500 fell by almost 7 the following session There were scant few  indicating that its business as usual in DC Therein lies a problem thats going to affect the MACRO scene shortlyMoodys one of the other big three credit ratings agencies also got into the act recently They announced that they are putting the credit rating of six major US banks up for review and warned of possible cuts to others Such downgrades both on the sovereign and corporate sides helped the recent yield surge we just experienced and will likely help to keep rates higher as investors demand more compensation for assuming the additional risk of loaning capital As companies and the US government are forced to issue more debt to stay in business as we advance they will have to do so at higher rates compounding the problem furtherAgain all of this isnt an issue until the market decides it is but the consequences of such a shift in sentiment could be serious Without the added boost of low interest rates an increasing money supply and large federal budget deficits it will be up to the economy and earnings to organically grow enough to keep the party going If not the powers to be will go right back to the printing pressfiscal stimulus days of the past few years and it will,416,2023-09-02,1,-0.9901,-0.9047618616780065

35,35,"Commodities Offer An Equity (And Bond) Hedge, But Tread Cautiously",The purpose of this article is to evaluate the state of the broader market and why commodities  whether specific ones or a broad basket fund  may offer a decent value proposition atWith equity and bondThere are a host of ways to play commodities One could invest in Energy funds such as the Vanguard Energy ETF  Or you can invest in specific futures ETFs  such as one for oil or natural gas ProShares Bloomberg Ultra Crude Oil ETF  or United States Natural Gas ETF  Better still would be a diversified basket of different commodities which would include oil and gas but other assets like chemicals crops or metals A newly launched fund from VanEck is the Commodity Strategy ETF  that I have my eye on There are a plethora of options in this space however A few to consider are the Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K1 ETF  and iShares SP GSCI CommodityIndexed Trust  among many othersTo start I want to be realistic about the risks and potential rewards from diving in to this sector theme While I see merit to it  and I stand by that outlook  this is not for everyone Commodities in general are a more volatile asset class with some more volatile than others Gold is a bit more stable but items like oil silver copper wheat etc are prone to seeing big swings in the shortterm This is something for readers to be firmly aware of and to ensure this aligns with their overall investment strategyWith that said lets examine how commodities as a whole perform during periods of economic stress I see this as relevant because recession risks remain high in the US and other parts of the developed world The Fed remains determined to bring inflation down and in doing so they are likely to dampen economic growth So  if a recession is on the way  does investing in commodities even make sense at the momentThe answer is it depends If we look back in history at broad commodity index performance during prior recessions we see a mixed picture There are times when this sector posted both strong gains times when it posted big lossesThe obvious question is how will this theme play out this time around  and the answer is the wild card Nobody knows for sure and history suggests there is a good chance of both outperformance or underperformance This is not inherently good or bad but highlights the risks If an investor is truly looking for protection this probably isnt the right move If the sector performs poorly that will only compound lossesBut the opposite is also true Commodities have served as profitable hedges before in other recessionary periods If that ends up being the case if  and when  a recession occurs this time around then those who have the foresight to buy this idea will be well prepared to mitigate overall losses The latter argument here is the one I am banking on but I wanted to ensure my followers knew that this is not a foregone conclusion and has risks of its ownWith the understand that commodity performance as a whole is a bit mixed during difficult economic scenarios  why consider this play at all right nowWell the answer  for me anyway  rests with the value of other options What I mean is that equities look a bit pricey here I am sitting with handsome gains for 2023 and dont want to trigger tax obligations So that prevents me from selling off exposure But valuations tell me to be cautious so Im not a big buyer here either So that begs the questions what I am to do with excess cash The answer for me is to diversify and commodities is one way to do thatTo understand the baseline behind this argument let us consider stock valuations A commonly used metric the PEG ratio shows us that the SP 500 is not exactly cheap right now In fact it looks darn expensive on a historical basis The PEG ratio measures the markets PE multiple divided by its forecast growth rate The higher it is the more expensive shares are and this metric ,32,2023-09-02,1,0.9965,-0.4482758466111777

43,43,The Fed Signals Another Rate Increase In 2023 (And No Cuts),The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC statement seemed dovish at first but then the FOMC signaled that one more Fed rate hike was not only possible but likelyA survey of the FOMC members revealed that seven membersThe FOMC statement said that they were highly attentive to inflation risks The bottom line is that the Fed remains datadependent but that means any good news like rising GDP or higher energy prices could mean another rate increaseI remain in the camp that energy is an inflation outlier so the Fed should not increase key interest rates further The housing component owners equivalent rent in the Consumer Price Index and wholesale service costs in the Producer PriceThere is nothing the Fed can do about the Presidents energy policies so I expect that the core rate of inflation will continue to moderate giving the Fed no rational reason to keep raising key interest ratesThe other reason why I do not expect the Fed to raise key interest rates is that it risks squelching the soft landing scenario it proudly engineeredOne example of high rates hurting growth is that credit card companies are now reporting a 363 default rate up from 213 two years ago in September 2021 Goldman Sachs is now forecasting that credit card losses will rise to 493 in late 2024 or early 2025In other words consumer credit is expected to continue to deteriorate heading right up through the November 2024 Presidential election Several credit card companies are based in Delaware and have supported Joe Biden for decadesThe fact that Capital One  has backed Joe Biden in the past bodes poorly for his reelection prospects since Capital One has historically had the highest default ratesAcross the pond the European Central Bank ECB has raised its key interest rate 025 to 4 the euros highest level ever In doing so the ECB signaled that fighting inflation is more important than stimulating economic growthItaly and Germany are big export economies but due to Chinas economic woes they are contracting this quarter and will likely drag the entire eurozone into a recessionInflation in the eurozone has dropped from a peak of 106 last year to 53 in August Food and energy inflation there is much more acute than in the US but there is little that the ECB can do to combat food and energy inflation so I think the ECB may have made a mistake with its latest rate increaseSpeaking of tight money Poland abruptly ceased all military aid to Ukraine to rebuild their own readiness as Poland seems increasingly worried that Russia could invade Poland next if the Ukrainian defenses failHigh rates are impacting several US industries including real estate Last Tuesday the Commerce Department reported that housing starts declined 113 in August to an annual pace of 128 million the lowest level since June 2020And the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales declined 07 in August to an annual pace of 404 million the fifth consecutive monthly declineThere is now only a 33month supply of homes for sale Existing home sales are low because most homeowners do not want to give up their low fixed mortgages Overall there seems to be no doubt that due to high mortgage rates and tight inventories existing home sales will continue to sufferCrude oil prices have risen 30 since June as fears of further supply shortages persist Last Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported that US crude oil inventories declined by 525 million barrels in the latest weekFor example Shell  halted work at its largest refinery in Europe in Rotterdam last week This will likely exaggerate the diesel shortage that has sent European prices soaring US refineries will also shut down for a while to convert to oxygenated winter gasoline blends from current summer blendsThe most likely big supply disruption in the next few months  other than another hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico  ma,10,2023-09-25,1,-0.9563,-0.7692307396449716

56,56,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,562,2023-09-17,1,0.8753,-0.5555555246913597

58,58,NextEra Energy Partners Stock: The 5 Stages Of Grief,On our last coverage of NextEra Energy Partners LP  we focused on the fact that growth plans were completely out of touch with reality and a downgrade was coming soonSource While we would love to take full credit for the bloodbath that followed we were a bit surprised at the magnitude of the moveA 40 rewrite obviously changes things We give our latest thoughts belowThe announcement did not seem too badSource NEP emphasis oursGrowth rate was cut in half but honestly nobody who has been following the renewable space massive margin compression or looking at financing conditions was buying the 12 growth story So one might have expected a celebration of sorts After all the stock already was down by about half from its 2021 peak before this announcementSo what we think is happening is that the market is not even buying those growth rate assumptions The reason is that the distribution growth is tied to debt and unit countWithout growing either distribution growth of any variety will be impossible After all NEP is paying most or all of its CAFD back as distributions Sure most contracts have inflation escalators so theres some natural growth from that But it wont be enough to counteract the debt reset You have 34 billion coming due in the next 4 years at a weighted average of about 26That needs to reset to over 75 in todays market So roughly you would be jumping up 5 on 35 billion or about 175 million annually So what does that mean for the company The company did 103 of CAFD for Q22023 which was 8 below Q22023 Even this was boosted by lower debt principal payments lower cash interest payments and lower maintenance capex If you take away 175 million from higher rates from that you can kiss your growth and your current distribution goodbye Even assuming a baseline runrate growth from current operations of about 10 total over the next four years your CAFD per unit falls below the distribution rate projected for Q42023 With these LP setups we have seen the tango and the drama and they follow a predictable arc Though each time it happens investors act surprisedThe first stage is coming to grips with the end of the growth story This seems like a benign event but marks the limits to what the market will tolerate in a company that sends all distributions back to investors and then keeps tapping the market for equity and debt issuance This is when the company goes from a regular dividend payer to a high yield as the stock falls a lot We have this happen for NEP alreadyWoohoo doubledigit yieldThe second stage is investors piling in just for the income Hey no growth is not a problem as long as the distribution can be maintained right We can sympathize but investors tend to forget two important facts The first is that these companies require capital spending beyond what they classify as maintenance capex to actually maintain the distribution Most of these assets have a limited life and maintenance capex alone is not enough to even sustain the distribution in the long run The second is that their general partner did not throw them out there to throw a steady distribution back It was designed as a dropdown vehicle and a way to access capital without destroying their own credit ratings They have zero use for a regular distribution back to them when theres no growthSo that leads to the third stage which is a distribution cut Its blamed on capital markets asset specific problems specific events and occasionally the Easter Bunny The company may even say they are cutting to fund growth which is about the silliest thing they can say but thats where this ultimately goes In the case of NEP well you have the capital market clause already in play The numbers dont lie One point we want to make is that the debt profile shown earlier in the article is from December 31 2022 By June 30 2023 this was another 12 billion higherOf course the cut is no,260,2023-09-29,6,0.9921,-0.8181817438016598

66,66,Energy Transfer: Potential Energy Trade Of The Decade,Energy Transfer  has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the commodities bull run of 2022 as its units outperformed the SP 500 while the successful performance of its business thanks to the increase of energy pricesEnergy Transfer units appreciated by 10 since my latest  on the company was published in December and there are reasons to believe thatAt the same time despite the price weakness Energy Transfers adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was 312 billion just slightly below the 323 billion from a year ago which indicates that the business has been able to successfully adapt to the new environment without suffering significant losses Thanks to this Energy Transfer was able to  155 billion in cash distribution to its unit holders in Q2 aloneGoing forward there are even more reasons for optimism First of all the overall improvement of the American  in recent quarters indicates that a hard landing that couldve destroyed the demand for natural gas even more is no longer in play This should help Energy Transfer to continue to increase its volumes as the market normalizesWhats more is that Russian natural gas is not returning en masse to the international markets which is good news for nonRussian natural gas producers and all the other businesses from the industry By the end of 2022 Russian gas supplies  for less than 13 of supplies to the European Union down from 41 in 2021 This was possible thanks to the increase in supplies of American LNG to the old continent which now provides 50 of the European LNG demandAdd to all of this the fact that Russia  be able to redirect its natural gas supplies to Asia in the same volumes in the following decades and it becomes obvious that the supply would remain tight while the demand is likely to increase thanks to the projected  of the global economy This is one of the main reasons why the IEA  that Asian spot LNG and TTF prices are expected to remain above their historic averages this year Thats why there are reasons to believe that Energy Transfer volumes would continue to increase and set new records as a combination of domestic and global developments would keep the natural gas flowing through its pipelinesConsidering all of this it seems that at this stage theres nothing not to like about Energy Transfer At the current price Energy Transfer  an attractive forward yield of over 9 and it expects its adjusted EBITDA for FY23 to range between131 billion and 134 billion On top of that back in December I noted that its units represent an upside of 40 Considering that they already appreciated by 10 since that time theres still around 30 upside left This view is shared by the street as well as the current  price target for Energy Transfer is 1728 per unitI see two major risks that could undermine the bullish thesis The first risk would be the inability of Energy Transfer to construct the Lake Charles export LNG facility and miss on global opportunities that the market offers So far the company signed deals to supply 79 million metric tons of natural gas per year to clients primarily from Asia but it still hasnt reached a final investment decision on whether the construct the facility in the first placeEarlier this week the management  the US Department of Energy to give the company a new export license for the facility as it wont be able to complete the project under the current license with a deadline in 2025 Considering that the request to extend the current license failed earlier his year and theres no guarantee that the new licensee would be issued at a time when others are already finishing the building of their export LNG facilities theres a risk that Energy Transfer would miss the ability to monetize global opportunitiesAnother risk to Energy Transfers bullish thesis is the return of Russian natural gas to international markets en masse which would lead to an extended period of price weakness in the natural gas market,460,2023-08-25,1,0.9934,0.09090908677685969

68,68,Is Devon Energy The Next Target Of An Energy Mega-Merger?,The WSJ reported yesterday that Exxon Mobil  is in the late stages of finalizing a deal to purchase Pioneer Natural Resources  in a deal worth roughly 60 billion A direct consequence of last years boomThe potential ExxonPioneer deal is the latest in an emerging mergers and acquisitions boom in the oil and gas upstream sector Enverus Intelligence released a  in July of this year stating MA activity in the oil and gas upstream sector totaled 24 billion in the second quarter of 2023 tripling from 8 billion in theThe natural question then is which stock can investors look to next in the oil and gas MA boom In this article we will take a look at a stock that has been gaining attention from investors perhaps attributable to the fact that it is one of the worstperforming largecap oil  gas stocks of the year Devon Energy Corporation With a market cap of 28 billion Devon Energy is the sixth largest publicly listed oil  gas exploration company in the United States and the worstperforming of the largecap stocks in its industryPriced at 43 per share DVN stock is currently at 52week lows down a massive 45 from its 52week high down 28 YTD and threatening to make new lows In comparison the iShares Oil  Gas Exploration ETF  is down just 195 YTD and down 14 from its 52week highDoes this massive underperformance from DVN present a major opportunity for investors given the backdrop of an MA boom or signal a major red flagThe market perhaps leans towards the latter Following the WSJ report of Exxons potential takeover of Pioneer the reaction across the remainder of the industry remains muted While as of writing Pioneer stock is up approximately 10 on the news of its pending acquisition none of its peers have managed to gain more than 100 basis points Devon Energy itself is up a mere 06 on the news The markets response may change in the coming days as it fully digests the news but for now this signal or lack thereof suggests that the market doesnt have much faith in another industry megamerger in the immediate futureIn favor of a Devon Energy acquisition it is perhaps the cheapest stock in the industry boasting a forward PE ratio of just 64 in comparison to Pioneers forward PE ratio of 90 based on its price prior to the acquisition announcementPutting aside any potential acquisition for a moment Devon Energy may be worth considering on a pure valuation basis Whether or not Devon Energy is a good value investment hinges largely on whether oil prices will remain elevated  as recently as October 3rd higher oil prices are here to stay attributable to the recent and extended period of underinvestment supply cuts and relentless demand growthInvestors may also be attracted to Devon Energys welldefined dividend strategy to share a substantial portion of its free cash flow with its investors A couple of years ago the oil company introduced a unique dividend framework consisting of a fixed and variable dividend It pays a flat quarterly dividend that it aims to maintain even during periods of lower oil prices Additionally it distributes up to fifty percent of its remaining free cash as variable dividends In the calendar years 2021 and 2022 Devon Energy paid investors dividends totaling 197 and 517 respectively Yields of 46 and 12 based on the current approximate share price of 43 In 2023 YTD Devon has paid investors total dividends of 210 or a 651 annualized yieldThe idea that Devon Energy could be the target of an acquisition is also supported by the geographic location of the companys assets The Enverus Intelligence report cited earlier states that MA activity is largely focused on operations and assets located in the Permian Basin According to Devon Energys The Delaware Basin is the second largest component of the larger Permian Basin and according to  accounts for 64 of the companys combined production volumes across Oil Natural Ga,51,2023-10-07,1,0.9964,0.2727272479338866

74,74,"NextEra Energy Partners: Is It Always Darkest Before Dawn, Or Pitch Black?",Over the past seven trading days the NextEra Energy Partners  unit price has fallen off a cliffAnalysts on Seeking Alpha and from numerous mainstream investment research groups have been piling on the gloomIn this article we will take a look at whether or not the dramatic stock price decline is justified by fundamentals and then offer our verdict on whether investors should get out before the lights at NEP go pitch black or if NEP has a good chance ofYes the market was likely not happy about the rough halving of the distribution growth guidance at NEP though no one who knew 1 where interest rates were 2 where its equity price was trading even before it recently lost half of its market value and 3 the sheer magnitude of its upcoming wall of CEPF and debt maturities believed that NEP was likely to achieve its lofty 12 distribution CAGR guidanceMoreover negative market sentiment was likely spurred further by the slew of downgrades and steep price target reductions from previously bullish mainstream investment analysts However based on the analysts commentary in most cases many of these downgrades seemed to be at least partially driven by chasing market sentiment rather than truly driven by fundamental analysis of the company itselfThe real reason for the selloff in the stock price  in our view  was the vicious cycle created by two major factorsThe main factor preventing NEE from rolling up NEP at this point is that it wants to limit its direct exposure to renewables in order to keep regulated assets at a higher percentage and therefore make the credit ratings agencies happy Could they eventually decide that they are going to roll up NEP anyway Absolutely However NEE has made it clear that an independent and healthy NEP is important to them being able to achieve their longterm growth goals by being able to develop and dropdown renewable assets to NEP thereby generating attractive profits for NEE via its renewables development business while also preserving its regulatedrenewables balance to protect its credit rating and retain a relatively attractive cost of debt capital so they are likely going to do everything they can to revive NEPs growth story before resorting to a rollupAs a result our view is that NEE is likely going to give NEP at least a few more years to try to recover an attractive cost of capital If those efforts fail  especially if NEP faces a choice between a distribution cut or financial distress  NEE could very likely go down the path of reabsorbing NEP This is a scenario that likely means that the current unit price decline is a case of it being darkest before pitch blackThat said we believe that there is still a very viable path for NEP to return to prosperity and that it could very well be darkest before dawn Here is the mathAfter Q1 management was expecting a December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA of 24172617 million based on the following assumptionsSince then the announced potential sale of their STX pipeline and the cancelation of an expected dropdown from their parent NextEra Energy  overwhelmed their other growth initiatives to reduce their December 31 2023 runrate projectlevel adjusted EBITDA by nearly 500 million to 19302130 millionOn the positive side corporate expenses have declined by an expected 10 million and the IDR fees of 157 million have been suspended for the foreseeable future reducing the hit to the December 31 2023 runrate NEPlevel adjusted EBITDA to 320 million or 19002100 million Moreover debt service expense has also been reduced substantially given that the STX debt will be taken out and the expected debt costs on the dropdown asset also do not apply so that improves the midpoint of estimated pretax CAFD by another 135 million PreTax Tax Credit deductions also declined by 135 million at the midpoint NonCash Income deductions declined by 5 million at the midpoint and Main,292,2023-10-06,6,0.9735,-0.07142856887755111

84,84,NextEra Energy Partners Is A Sell: Evaluating CEPF And Take-Under Risk,NextEra Energy Partners  has plunged to apparently distressed levels with a distribution yield well into the double digits The stock has plunged 50 over the past week alone triggered by an announcement that the company has lowered its targeted distributionIn my last and first report on NEP  I recommended readers to avoid buying the stock At the time NEP was highly touted by my peers but I couldnt reconcile the math to see why this wasnt just a 7 yield with poor growth prospects The stock has been clobbered since then and now trades lower than it did 10 years agoI didnt go far enough My goal in that report was merely to tame bullish expectations To that aim identifying that higher interest rates would significantly hold back growth far from the companys thentarget of 8 to 12 distribution growth was just enough But had I spent more time understanding the ramifications of the convertible equity portfolio financings then I would have instead rated the stock a clear short I am kicking myself for that  and to add insult to injury I even sold a couple puts at a 25 strike price that I have since covered at a nonsignificant loss Even after a big valuation reset I must downgrade the stock to a sell  better late than neverTo the unsuspecting eye the extent of NEPs stock price plunge looks unjustified Sure the stock deserved to fall after lowering both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution CAFD guidance from prior targets of 24 billion and 860 million respectively But the 50 plunge at first glance looks overdone given that management is still targeting 6 distribution growth through 2026The problem is that 6 growth still looks too aggressive In my prior report I have already discussed how higher interest rates should bring growth down to a crawl due to the companys heavy reliance on external acquisitions to drive growth but there I missed something the convertible equity financing buyoutsThis was an issue that was frequently dismissed due to the company having previously outlined plans to sell off their natural gas pipeline portfolio to raise funds as well as parent NEE suspending 157 million in IDRs to offset that sale We can see below that NEP has around 18 billion of convertible equity financing that needs to be paid off over the next few yearsIn total there is around 46 billion of CEPF that needs to be addressed over the coming yearsThe sale of the natural gas pipelines is expected to address around 1518 billion of that if they are able to sell the pipelines at a 10x multiple Even if we assume that they are able to execute on such a transaction which is no guarantee given that the stocks of publicly traded pipeline companies are trading around that 10x EBITDA multiple they still have around 3 billion remaining to deal with I am doubtful that NEP could issue additional unsecured debt to raise financing given that the company is already approaching downgrade thresholdsMoreover issuing debt would likely need to come at a 7 to 8 interest rate if not higher which would heavily impact cash available for distributions 8 interest on 3 billion in debt would amount to 240 million  compare that against 820 million in projected 2023 consolidated CAFDStill though many readers may be thinking that the price is right here with the stock trading at its highest distribution yield everAgain it isnt so simple We should first calculate the valuation There are 190 million shares outstanding inclusive of NEE shares yielding a 43 billion market cap As of the latest quarter there was 59 billion of longterm debt 573 million of nearterm debt and 587 million in cash I have included a breakdown of the debt from the annual report to show the low interest rates of maturing debtI have seen some peers use the above numbers to conclude that NEP is trading at around 4x EBITDA using guidance for 21 billion in adjusted EBITDA But the pr,211,2023-10-04,6,0.9707,-0.5789473379501401

I'm Buying The NextEra Energy Crash With Both Hands,Markets are in turmoil While the SP 500 is still holding up well real carnage has taken place in defensive sectors Looking at the data below we see that utilities real estate and consumer defensive stocks were among the biggest losers of the pastWhat were dealing with here is the realization that inflation is sticky This means the Fed will have to keep rates elevated for longer That wouldnt be such a bad thing if the economy were in better shapeThe market is now putting a 90 probability on a 450 Federal Funds rate 12 months from now In August that number was close to 60 In the first half of this year it was 0The worst thing on everyones mind at least on my mind is that Mr Powell may have to choose between protecting the economy versus fighting inflation soonLooking at the first chart of this article it is no surprise that energy stocks are doing well in this environment Energy stocks have pricing power Most major players have low breakeven prices healthy balance sheets and the ability to be profitable at subdued oil pricesConsumer staples REITs and regulated utilities are different While the strongest players have great balance sheets they often come with high gross debt levels and business models that make it hard to hike pricesRegulated utilities are no different emphasis addedThis brings me to  On August 11 I  that the company offered a compelling investing opportunity I was wrong Since then the stock has fallen 23Now the stock is down 45 from its alltime high yet its 10year total return is still 243 130 points above the weighted sector averageAs much as I hate being wrong Im doubling downWhile we can expect pressure to remain high on utilities the value is getting great at these levels which is why Im writing this articleSo lets get to itIn the lengthy introduction I already briefly explained the core of the problem sticky inflation and elevated ratesBloombergs  hit the nail on the headEssentially NextEras success is built on three pillars ownership of Florida Power  Light Co a reputation for efficiency and cost management and being the largest renewable power developer in the US I remember in 2020 and 2021 when rates were low and everyone was in love with renewables NextEra was one of the most popular stocks on the marketHowever the recent fall from grace can be attributed to the troubles faced by its subsidiary NextEra Energy Partners LP  The subsidiarys reduced expectations for dividend growth and challenges in selling planned projects led to a significant drop in its stock value impacting the parent companyAccording to the company during the September 27 Wolfe Utilities Midstream  Clean Energy Conference  emphasis addedThis is what Bloomberg wroteIn light of funding challenges and risks related to revenue growth it also does not help that investors get a better yield buying treasury notes as seen in the chart below When it comes to income there is no need to take huge risks Especially not when it comes to NEE which still yields less than 4Furthermore during the aforementioned conference the company acknowledged a slow start in the renewables market due to inflation interest rates and supply chain issuesHowever they are optimistic about the market gaining momentum in 2024 Despite increased power purchase agreement PPA prices renewables remain the lowcost generation optionAlso early signs of falling panel and battery prices along with resolving supply chain uncertainties are boosting the renewables market may be one of the most important things to keep in mind when investing However I also like to buy good investments at great prices When averaging down catching falling knives may not be the worst idea Ive done it many times In 2020 I did it with energy This year Im doing it with defense contractorsFor example Goldman Sachs  did cut its buy rating from 83 to 73 yet it remained ,185,2023-10-04,1,0.9904,-0.07692307396449716

94,94,Devon Energy: Ignored Oil Play,The potential      should make   even more appealing The independent energy company trades at yearlyDevon Energy was oddly left out of the recent rally in oil The stock now trades at multiyear lows even despite the big potential merger in the energy space and oil prices that spiked to 90bblExxon Mobil is potentially bidding for Pioneer Natural Resources in a move to boost oil production from the Permian Basin Exxon Mobil actually hit an alltime high right prior to news ofWhile the details of a potential 60 billion merger are unknown and might not even happen the interesting aspect is the valuation disconnect between Devon and Pioneer here Devon trades at only 66x forward EPS estimates while Pioneer trades at 99x EPS targets and Exxon Mobil is rumored as willing to pay another 10 premium for Pioneer on top of the rally on FridayEven Exxon Mobil now trades at 120x forward EPS targets The stock market is oddly favoring the energy giant over the independent producers hence one reason the company is probably targeting Pioneer The deal could be very accretive with the use of cash though shareholders are unlikely to want Exxon Mobil to pile on a bunch of debt againDevon Energy continues to boost oil production with guidance for Q3 production reaching 322K bd to 330K bd up from 323K bd back in Q2 Oil production growth reached 8 YoY and total production hit 662K boedThe odd part here is that Pioneer Resources only produced 369K bd of oil during Q2 with total production at 710K boed The independent energy company had oil production at 52 of total production slightly above the 49 oil production levels at DevonOne has to really question the valuation discrepancy between Pioneer with a potential offer for 60 billion and Devon Energy trading with a current market cap of only 28 billion The issue really isnt the valuation for Pioneer at 60 billion with forecasts for annual free cash flow topping 5 billion annually with WTI prices at 80bblDevon now offers investors a massive dividend opportunity The energy company pays a fixed 020 quarterly dividend amounting to a 18 dividend yield while the variable amount hit 029 during Q2 and the higher oil prices are likely to help boost this amountBased on a consistent 049 quarterly dividend Devon would pay a 196 annual dividend offering a 45 dividend yield On top of these dividend payouts the company repurchased 38 million shares for 200 million during Q2 and the current stock weakness along with oil prices rallying to 90 provides an ideal opportunity to buy very cheap sharesThe key investor takeaway is that Devon Energy just appears an ignored energy stock despite strong profits and capital returns Exxon Mobil might be chasing Pioneer due to Permian Basis resources and a CEO looking to retire making a deal more possible but Devon Energy is the much cheaper play hereInvestors in Pioneer Natural Resources should use any offer from Exxon Mobil to flip the investment into Devon Energy One can sell Pioneer at alltime highs and flip that investment into Devon at multiyear lowsStone Fox Capital aka Mark Holder is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance He is also Series 65 licensed and has 30 years of investing experience including 10 years as a portfolio manager  The information contained herein is for informational purposes only Nothing in this article should be taken as a solicitation to purchase or sell securities Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion or consult a financial advisor Investing includes risks including loss of principal Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investmen,72,2023-10-08,0,0.9796,0.3333333111111126

96,96,Suncor Energy: 5 Reasons It's Going Higher,Suncor  is one of the largest oil companies in Canada Somewhat like Exxon Mobil  it produces oil processes that oil into refinery products such as gasoline and diesel and sells those end products inUnlike Exxon it does not drill for oil it extracts oil from oil sands which is more of a mining process than a drilling processSuncor is in what I will call the run out phase of its business It is past needing much exploration and development rather it is extracting its known reserves as we work through the energy transition Over the next few decades Suncor will produce oil and eventually have to transition to another business or cease operations in the middle of the centuryAs a result of lower capex and oilI rate Suncor a buy for Canadians It is worth watching for Americans and is a potential trade however be aware of the 15 dividend tax haircut if you intend to hold it longtermHere are five reasons why I think Suncor is a buy nowAs you can see from the following chart Suncor has 26 years of reservesIn addition it can produce those reserves profitably at an average price of 35 per barrel and still pay the dividend While we have seen 35 oil prices during Covid with the depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and EV adoption still several years away from causing outright demand destruction oil markets are likely to remain on Kirks peak oil plateau versus plungeAnother difference between Suncor and the other oil majors is that it has very little overseas exposure In other words well over 90 of its oil comes from its own sources in the oil sands therefore they are not exposed to what I would call foreign entanglementsThe ability to extract more oil from the sands does not come with significant capex thus margins are relatively high after the sunk in costs which are already sunkSuncor spends very little money on exploration and exploratory drilling Due to Canadian policy Suncor is essentially in a run off phase of its business That is they are simply going to extract their 26 year known reserves over timeThis gives Suncor much higher gross margins than other oil companies such as Exxon This can be seen in the following chart comparing Suncor to Exxon and Chevron Because Suncor has a very low cost per barrel it tends to have very high refinery margins also called the crack spread This means that when the raw material ie a barrel of oil is cracked it is turned into gasoline diesel or other enduser products The differential between the barrel of oil cost and what the end products are sold for is called the crack spreadThe Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is nearing completion This expansion will more than double the amount of oil being transported to the West Coast and from there to Asia including China and India This will be a huge advantage for Suncor as it will enlarge its market which currently is mainly the US market and a minor amount to Europe from the East CoastNow admittedly the Trans Mountain has been under construction for 10 years and has run into all kinds of issues but there appears to be only one left before completion That revolves around Native Americans and environmentalists asking for a route deviation It appears at the moment that this issue will be resolved positively and that Sun Corps will be shipping to Asia sometime in 2024 or 2025 at the latestOver the last few quarters Suncor has bought back 22 of its shares Most investors have heard about Exxons huge 75 billion share buyback and Chevrons huge 50 billion share buyback but neither one has bought back nearly the number of shares on a percentage basis as Suncor hasSince Suncor has dedicated 23 billion per year for its dividend the dividend keeps growing with every share bought back since the 23 billion would be divided by a smaller number Management has said this will go on indefinitely based on free cash flow which is currently substantialSuncor is also paying,28,2023-10-17,0,0.9901,-0.24999996875000394

108,108,3 Reasons Why TC Energy Is A Better Buy Than Energy Transfer,TC Energy  and Energy Transfer  are two investment grade high yielding midstream infrastructure businesses that have large and welldiversified portfolios Moreover we own both and think both are undervalued at present While ET has long been  and stillBoth businesses have solid balance sheets and ETs balance sheet in particular has been strengthened considerably in recent years After slashing its distribution in half in late 2020 in the wake of the energy market crash and its investment grade credit rating being threatened ET management has aggressively paid down debt and brought its leverage ratio down to within its longterm target range ofMeanwhile TRP has a better credit rating than ET with a BBB scoring from SP albeit with a negative outlook However TRP took a significant step forward in securing its credit rating and strengthening its balance sheet by  a 39 billion stake in its Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf Transmission systems As a result it is now on much firmer financial footing and has more flexibility moving forward to invest in growth projects and return capital to shareholdersIn addition to its slightly higher credit rating what sets TRPs balance sheet apart from ETs is that its debt maturity ladder is in better shape As of the end of 2022 41 of ETs debt  by the end of 2027 putting considerably pressure on them to either pay down debt aggressively as it matures which would in turn limit ETs ability to invest in growth projects andor grow returns of capital to unitholders or potentially absorb meaningfully higher interest expense given that interest rates have risen so rapidly in recent yearsMeanwhile TRPs weighted average term to maturity is a whopping 20 years with much of its debt not due for decades to come This gives it a very stable cost of debt profile which is very valuable at a time when interest rates have risen so rapidly Moreover its recent large asset stake sales give it considerable capital to pay down debt that matures in the near futureWhile ET has closed some of the gap with TRP in this category over the past few years TRPs recent asset stake sale continues to give it the edge in balance sheet strengthTRPs greatest strength relative to ET is its asset portfolio While ET is certainly well diversified and generates the vast majority 90 of its cash flow from feebased contracted assets TRP has a superior combined contractedregulated exposure 95 compared to ETs Moreover much of its 95 contractedregulated exposure comes from regulated assets which are utilitylike in nature with investment grade counterparties making them inherently more defensive and higher quality in nature than ETs contracted assets TRPs contracted assets are also extremely competitively positioned with lengthy contract terms giving them a more stable cash flow profile than ETs assets have in aggregateWith some of the very best midstream assets on the North American continent TRPs portfolio is built to last As Morningstar  its portfolioLast but not least we think that TRP stock has more upside potential than ET stock at the moment As you can see in the chart below ET stock has risen nicely over the past year whereas TRPs stock price has lost nearly one quarter of its valueWhile ET remains slightly undervalued in our view  thereby justifying its stock price appreciation over the past year  TRP has traded down to at least some degree in a manner that is unjustified Mr Market disliked the uncertainty that came with the asset sale program was somewhat disappointed by the valuation that the company fetched for its asset stake sale and now appears to be a bit unhappy about its announced  of its liquids business However the underlying asset portfolio remains very high quality and performing quite well the balance sheet is in quite solid shape and we believe that the spinoff will actually  for the business Meanwhile the dividend remai,248,2023-09-04,0,0.9864,0.2941176297577865

111,111,Vaalco Energy: Doubling Down On Acquisition,   appears to have focused upon the growth aspects of the recent  of TransGlobe Energy TGA This likewise appears to be paying dividends in excess of what was publicly anticipated before theThe  Gabon has not affected the company at all according to the press release That is probably because the companys operations are offshore and those operations provide some badly need currency Offshore operations are less likely to be disturbed by something like thisVaalco Energy began as a small player in theEven wells to add production are expensive for a company of this size Therefore enough cash and cash flow was necessary before more drilling could occur as this management wisely decided to keep a debtfree But the acquisition of TransGlobe Energy will allow for production growth in between the major offshore projects that were not originally available to Vaalco Energy The TransGlobe Energy wells are onshore and actually very cheap onshore wells So activity is easy to rachet up or down as industry conditions dictateFurthermore both companies were small enough that production was picked up periodically rather than sold at the time of production as is typical in the United States and Canada The combined companies have a smoother cash inflow than they did separately Therefore there is less need to keep as much cash on hand in between production salesBoth the Canadian and the Egyptian businesses showed growth in the latest quarters have clearly improved Since the majority of these wells are vertical wells drilling time is a larger part of the total well cost than is the case when horizontal drilling and fracking would be involved Management has not yet released payback periods and rates of return on these wells But an improvement shown like the one discussed above is likely to significantly elevate profitabilityThe new issue is the horizontal well Since that type of well is a brandnew idea there is likely to be a period of time between this well and any potential horizontal wells in the future In this area horizontal wells were not needed for some very good production results But an older field could change that attitude That is what management is trying to figure outLike any other production area Egypt has a lot of tired fields and intervals Success of horizontal drilling and modern completion techniques could spur a revival of production in some places that were deemed uneconomical as was the case in the United StatesVery longterm readers may remember that this acreage was originally considered natural gas acreage especially by the seller Clearly enough progress was made to find a very different production mix Many times in the years since this acreage was acquired readers have wondered if it was worth the effort because previous management largely concentrated on the Egyptian businessIt looks like not only was the acquisition worth the effort by previous management it also looks like the acquisition is going to turn out to be a steal The kind of production mix shown above is far more valuable than just natural gas It will also likely be more profitable as wellMore importantly Canada often has acreage nearby that can be acquired to cheaply expand operations if this initial venture proves successful It is very likely that the current management will acquire more acreage in the future given the progress noted aboveIn summary this management has brought more energy to bear on both of these businesses than I have seen in a long time The result is progress I had nearly given up hope in seeing If management keeps up the current pace both businesses will be far more successful than many of us dreamed possible of the original company production before the acquisition of TransGlobe Energy Management had finished a campaign of drilling to expand production The next step is to get those wells producing to the extent possible while rebuilding cash levels to rinse and repe,50,2023-10-12,0,0.9994,0.7142856632653098
112,112,Tsakos Energy Navigation: Low Valuation With Significant Upside Potential,Tsakos Energy Navigation is a shipowner focused on the crude and product tanker markets but with some limited exposure to LNG carriers they own three LNGCs and to shuttle tankers The companys balance sheet was in a rickety position before the recent upturn but strength in tanker rates from early2022 onwards has allowed the company to materially improve its financial positionShareholder returns have been substantially weaker than those of peers it is difficult to compete against DHTs 100 and EURNs 80 payouts of net income or FROs and OETs generous distributions which has disappointed investors Furthermore some questionable capital allocation decisions were made exemplified byTNP owns a fleet of 58 onthewater vessels along with ten vessels on order The company is mostly focused on the Suezmax and Aframax sectors with 18 and 19 vessels in each of those subsectors respectively including a few shuttle tankers plus two additional LR2s Suezmax and Aframax rates have been exceptionally strong since the Russian invasion of Ukraine but have suffered over the past few months as Urals oil traded above the price cap displacing the sanctionscompliant fleet from the trade and Russia curtailed its exportsThe company follows a balanced approach employing some vessels on the spot market and others on fixed and variable charters which is a differentiated strategy from most peers in the sector which tend to employ their vessels virtually 100 on spot This allowed the company to survive the downturn despite their levered balance sheet but has weighed on potential returns once the market turned upward since Tsakos still has several vessels earning wellbelow market rates On the other hand the charter coverage provides downside protection if rates would happen to notably weaken in the near to mediumtermTNPs current fleet employment can be seen in their  which was updated on August 30 The company has done a good job rolling legacy contracts at higher rates whereas they have also done some blendandextend deals For example TNP recently disclosed it had agreed to fix the Neo Energy a 2007built LNG carrier at 1155kday until February 2024 the charterer also has a oneyear extension option at 100kday Annualizing the increased contribution from the steamer relative to the previous 37kday contract equates to 096sh in annual EPS from this single ship alone illustrating the companys substantial operating leverage Additionally they also have a modern LNG carrier on a variable hire contract with a floor of 50kday and a cap at 145kday LNGC rates have increased materially over the past couple of months so the contribution from this vessel should also improve materially throughout the second half of the yearOf the 10 vessels on order six are already fixed on medium to longterm contracts including the four dualfuel Aframaxes and the two shuttle tankers whereas the two Suezmaxes with delivery in 2025 and the two recently ordered MR2s remain unchartered Considering current newbuild pricing I believe it makes sense to secure charter cover to derisk the investments although that is obviously contingent on the deals potentially availableOverall TNP has by far the highest operating leverage in the tanker sector but that has partly gone unnoticed given their substantial charter cover part of it remains at below market rates However if market balances remain tight TNP will continue to roll its exposure going forward leading to higher EPS and FCF helping illustrate their true earnings potentialLooking ahead I expect TNP to also divest the older portion of the fleet they own four 20052006 built Suezmaxes that look like prime disposal candidates as well as two 2007built Aframaxes two 2006built LR2s the Handysizes all built in 2007 and a 2003built Panamax I do not expect the disposal of this older tonnage in one fell swoop but for TNP to pursue a more gradua,21,2023-10-04,0,0.9888,-0.09090908677685969

121,121,Devon Energy: Time To Go Bear Hunting,Devon Energy  has flat out taken a beating over the last 30 days falling nearly 19 since the beginning of September This has occurred while other companies in its peer group have been able to treadI  to identify a trading pattern that developed for sudden price drops following earnings I correctly predicted the dividend payout and response following earnings in Q2 In this article I use the same methodology to show that DVNs recent price performance makes it undervalued todayI propose an explanation for investors looking to understand this price performance as well as a target price to accumulate shares The current price creates a valuable value to price dislocation for DVN that can be extremelyI will be blunt The current price decline for DVN is simply not rooted in logic in any sense of the word Other producers who sell the exact same product do not show the same dismal share performance For comparison there is a 25 difference in price performance between DVN and FANG over the last three months I did not count PXD due to the 10 spike in share price prior to this article being published The last time I checked both of these companies sell oil NGLs and natural gas into essentially the same market What can possibly explain thisSimply put WE are the cause of this DVN has an extremely high exposure to individual investors versus institutional investors compared to its peer group As a result its investor base has shown to be more erratic to market events than typicalThis is in part created by its share price relative to its peers and the lack of a major shareholder like Warren Buffett in the case of OXY In the table below you can see that DVN has 15x to 3x the amount of public ownership exposure compared to Occidental Pioneer or Diamondback Energy All data was obtained from the SA page for each companyI believe the recent price performance is the culmination of individual investors finally having enough after several quarters of falling dividends While in my opinion this should not have been expected the market as a whole never tends to respond rationallyTo prove this thesis the impact of this can again be seen in the volatility of Devons share price DVN exhibits a significantly higher beta than either of the other three companiesMost investors would call this a negative but I view this as one of my fundamental differentiators for why I invest in DVN and not either of the other three stocks Having a higher beta ensures two things Higher highs and lower lowsThis presents investors with the opportunity to invest at more attractive entry points and also the opportunity to trim their profits when they potentially become overvalued You may need a strong stomach at times but this can be counteracted by having a clear vision of what price DVN represents for a solid value purchase Thanks to a fairly simple business model and highly public commodity prices this can be derived from some basic math the average WTI price in Q3 was 8230barrel This is up from 7376barrel in Q2 a very sizeable increase Yet DVN is now at the lowest price so far in 2023 even exceeding the low set in March during the brief banking crisis that developed after the run on Silicon Valley BankFurther DVN has guided both an increase in production and a drop in capital expenses for the quarter and the remainder of the year DVN has guided for capex to  at the midpoint This is down from 1036 billion in Q2 Production is guided to rise to 326000 barrels of oil production per day up from 323000 barrels per day in Q2Running these variables through my model and the slight increase in average natural gas price in Q3 of 259MCF generates net earnings of about 107 billion This is up  when DVN only registered net earnings of 698 million This number was calculated using  provided by DVN for production price realizations taxes and expensesIf the base dividend remains unchanged 020share I expect,57,2023-10-09,0,0.989,-0.14285713265306196
122,122,Enphase: Top Solar Energy Leader On The Verge Of A Huge Bottom,Investors in leading solar technology company Enphase Energy Inc  have been battered since ENPH topped out in December 2022 The sellers then went on a rampaging run that saw ENPH falling nearly 68 through its October 2023 lows retestingThat zone has held ENPHs longterm uptrend since May 2021 As such Im heartened to observe constructive buying sentiments in October suggesting dip buyers have returned However its still too early to ascertain whether ENPH buyers could muster a sustained reversal following its steep pullback Notwithstanding that caution I believe there are reasons to be optimisticAs seen above ENPH is no longer overvalued relative to its sector peers Seeking Alpha Quant assigned ENPH a C valuation grade suggesting it can be considered within the fair value zone Furthermore given its bestinclass A growth and profitability grade theHowever the growth normalization over the past year resulting in its worst battering in recent times is justified Its weak guidance from its  earnings call contributed to its D earnings revisions grade as it underperformed analysts estimatesWith ENPH still up by nearly 97 on a 5Y total return CAGR basis I believe its clear that buyers have not abandoned ship Late buyers who chased its late 2022 highs are the ones that have been hurt but not early dip buyers who bought well before its surge from its 2017 lowsTherefore its opportune to assess whether the current levels are reasonable for investors to consider returning or should they wait for more clarity from management Accordingly Enphase is scheduled to report its thirdquarter or  on October 26 I believe buyers have already priced in a relatively tepid Q3 release given the continued decline through ENPHs October 2023 lowsFurthermore analysts estimates indicate Enphase could report negative revenue growth over the next three quarters likely reflecting the inventory destocking challenges in its downstream customers Hobbled by the high cost of capital with the Feds unprecedented rate hikes the market conditions could remain hostile for Enphase However with analysts having turned more cautious I believe it sets the bar lower for management to cross providing higher potential upside opportunities if the company reports a lessfeared releaseI believe there are reasons to be optimistic Enphase remains a highgrowth stock as I highlighted earlier Its operating within a secular growth market with growth potential outside of the US In addition its no longer a onetrick pony selling just microinverters but a suite of integrated solar solutions As such it should strengthen its competitive advantagesWhile the rivalry with Tesla  in solar technology needs to be observed carefully the scale of Enphases high potential growth drivers should help mitigate some of the competitive headwinds Coupled with its rocksolid profitability grade it should support the companys innovation efforts to stay in the front seat of the leading pack fending off challenges from Tesla and other rivalsMoreover ENPH isnt your 50x PE stock any longer It last traded at a forward adjusted PE of 258x or a free cash flow yield of 43 Given its highgrowth profile I believe its reasonable for buyers to return to defend it from sliding further from the current levels The question is whether the price action indicates such robust defenseI gleaned that ENPH buyers have returned this month since they tried to defend against a further slide in May 2023 but failedMoreover it is consistent with ENPHs bottom since May 2021 with firm buying support expected to defend ENPHs longterm uptrend bias at the 110 zone However I must caution that losing the 110 support level decisively is a red flag and could lead to much further downside volatility if buyers fail to hold it robustly Investors may want to consider appropriate risk management strategies to deal with that possibilityOtherwise,57,2023-10-12,0,0.9909,-0.3999999866666671

131,131,Why Diamondback Energy Will Be The Next Permian M&A Target,I predict that Diamondback Energy  will be the next publicly traded tier1 MA target in the Permian and that ConocoPhillips  will be the likely acquirer While Reuters  this morning that COPYou already know that the oil patch has seen a plethora of big deals since the pandemic hit in 2020  and even before then with Occidental Petroleums  purchase of Anadarko ConocoPhillips was an early mover with its welltimed purchases of Concho ResourcesAs shown in the graphic above this flurry of MA activity leaves only a few toptier public Permian producers left and I list them in the table below according to enterprise value EV per Seeking AlphaAs you can see both OXY and EOG would be very large transactions  significantly bigger than either of the recent deals for Pioneer and Hess HES which only Exxon and Chevron had the ability to engineerThat leaves Devon and Diamondback of which FANG is clearly the superior Permian play And thats the reason COP  already a largescale tier1 producer in the Permian  will likely be the buyerFor longterm energy investors EOGs pristine balance sheet  which is actually net cash positive  bodes very well for investors in terms of dividends and share buybacks Thats especially the case given the current relatively strong OG commodity price environmentThe following graphic taken from a recent  shows the companys footprint in the Permian FANG has large leaseholds in both the Midland and Delaware BasinsAs you can see FANG has a huge inventory of longlateral drilling locations 5400 in the Midland Basin and 3000plus in the Delaware BasinCOP as a result of its MA activity also has large and excellent positions in the Permian as shown from these two slides taken from an Together the two companies would be a Permian powerhouse with over 13 million acres and production as of Q2COP FANG Combined 1158900 boedSuch a combination would vault COP ahead of the ExxonPioneer combination in terms of No 1 Permian production with more than double OXYs Q2 Permian production of The combined companies would also significantly extend the life span of COPs already huge Permian inventory  out to as long as three or perhaps even four decadesHowever Diamondback would be a large fish for COP to swallow Note COPs previous two deals for Concho and Shells assets were both under 10 billion 97 billion and 92 billion respectively However the free cash flow from these deals is exactly why COP is now big enough to tackle FANGCOPs current market cap is 1442 billion with net debt of 96 billion or an EV about 42x that of FANG So such a deal is definitely doable And the fact that FANG generates strong free cash flow 547 million in Q2 and is a very disciplined operator adds to its MA attractivenessMeantime FANG shareholders would get a much more diversified production profile because COP has significant and growing  exposure to global LNG prices as well as strong Brentbased production in Alaska see I never advise investors to invest on the basis of takeover potential In this case the suggested deal could obviously not come to fruition for a variety of reasons primarily that someone else could make an offer for FANG or that COP could decide to go through with an offer for CrownRock or some other company In addition the relatively high interest rate environment means such a deal  like most deals of late  would likely be an allstock transaction That being the case COP CEO Ryan Lance might not want to take on what would be a relatively large and dilutive allstock transactionEnergy investors have likely not seen the end of MA in the oil patch However the number of publicly traded tier1 Permian operators has shrunk dramatically over the past few years FANG remains a standout  and if the company does not merge with EOG it will get squeezed by the bigger players and will likely be the next big tier1 company to be ta,32,2023-10-26,0,0.9955,0.9999998333333611

133,133,Cenovus Energy: Preferred Shares Could Yield 8-12% Upon Reset,Cenovus Energy   is a large integrated oil and gas producer in Canada The company produced in excess of 700000 barrels of oilequivalent per day while its downstream throughput averaged in excessIn this article I will explain why I think some of the preferred shares issued by Cenovus could be interesting to own In Canada most fixtofloat preferred shares lock in a preferred dividend for a period of five years and that makes some of the preferred share issues quite appealingI wont go into too much detail on the financial results as the preferred equity isThe company reported a total revenue of C122B in the second quarter of the year  I will use the companys Q2 results as these are based on a US75 Brent and a C74 WCS oil price The oil and bitumen prices are substantially higher and were higher throughout the third quarter so while Im expecting a strong result in the third quarter Im using the Q2 results for a more conservative approachAs you can see above the company reported a net profit of C866M which represented an EPS of C045 Interestingly Cenovus did not record any preferred share dividends from the reported net income and after deducting the C9M in preferred dividend payments the net income attributable to the shareholders of Cenovus was C857M as you can see belowThats important It means that at US75 WTI and C75 WCS and the refineries not running at full capacity the company needed just 1 of its net income to cover the preferred dividend payments Expressed in a percentage the preferred dividend coverage ratio was 9600A second element I like to check is the asset coverage ratio As of the end of June Cenovus had almost C54B in assets and the equity component of the balance sheet was C273B The company also had C22B in cash while its longterm debt totalled C85B for a net debt position of C64B roundedAs of the end of June the company also had 36 million preferred shares outstanding All preferred shares have a principal value of C25 per share which means Cenovus had about C900M in preferred equity on the balance sheet This means that theres about C263B in equity ranked junior to the preferred shares and even if you would exclude the C29B in goodwill on the balance sheet theres in excess of C23B in tangible equity on the balance sheet that ranks junior to the preferred sharesLong story short Im very happy with the preferred dividend coverage ratio and the asset coverage ratioI used to keep track of the preferred shares of Husky Energy but those shares had pretty low yields when the interest rates on the financial markets were low This has obviously changed and although the underlying company is now much larger when Cenovus acquired Husky Energy the preferred shares simply remained outstanding and the higher interest rates on the financial markets create opportunitiesIm keeping a close tab on the Series 1   and Series 3 preferred shares  issued by Cenovus Both issues currently have relatively low preferred dividends but the next reset dates are coming close As the image below shows the Series 3 will reset first at the end of next year while the Series 1 will reset in Q1 2026Looking at the Series 3 those preferred shares are trading at C1925 the principal value is C25 per preferred share and that series currently yields 469 or C11725 per share per year And based on the current share price the current yield is approximately 61 Not bad but also not greatHowever at the end of 2024 the preferred dividend rate of those preferred shares will reset to the fiveyear Canada government bond yield plus a markup of 313 basis points The  is currently trading at 415 which means that in the current situation the preferred dividend on the Series 3 would reset to 415  313  728 This represents C182 per year and would result in a yield of 95 based on the current preferred share priceWe also can run the numbers from,78,2023-10-14,0,0.9968,0.33333322222225925

136,136,Energy Transfer Is Doing Just Fine,Dear fellow InvestorsLast nights    for  was at first blush a bit disappointing to me not so much because of the small performance miss due to lower natural gas NG andFor some time we have been watching ET management discuss how they were focused on reducing debt leverage as they seek a credit upgrade For some time we have been listening to management discuss how they are imposing strict criteria to any new project or acquisition they consider suggesting everything will have to help ET deleverage while also being accretive to cash flowLast night the first time I listened to the Conference Call II didnt have a problem hearing that ET was boosting capital expenditure expectations to 2  3 billion annually but I didnt like hearing management suggest that they really wanted to do at least 3 billion Sure I love the idea of 3 billion in new investments generating 13 returns allowing ET to grow EBITDA by roughly 400 million per year but what I really wanted to hear was how ET was going to let  leverage drop below 40x in my dreams I felt that managements desire to grow conflicted with the way I might manage the company if I was in fact the King or CEOManagement expressed confidence and self satisfaction with their recent acquisitions they even suggested the Enable deal was operating far above their S4 prior expectations over 45 better in fact Management also sounded very confident that the more recent Lotus deal was also going to greatly exceed prior plans But while hearing these glowing remarks I couldnt help but feel that one or two recent deal successes certainly do not tell the whole story I felt Id rather have heard more about a humble desire to pay down more debt and raise the distribution on the units fasterFeeling grumpy and unsure I decided to listen to the call a 2nd time and take more notes Early on I realized that management did in fact explain that they were driving the leverage down to the lower level of the 40 to 45 range This was new Previously management always emphasized that they wanted to reach this range and then reconsider what to do next Now they were more or less committing to the 40x level Then later in last nights call when asked about whether they would allow the leverage ratio to rise above the 40 to 45 range if an attractive acquisition required it management said no they did not intend to allow the ratio to rise above this range more or less I paraphrasedThen I listened more closely to their discussion about Lake Charles and the LNG opportunity While determined to do everything they can to move the project forward management made it clear they do not intend to invest nor own more than 25 of the equity in the project same as prior statements in the past In fact they emphasized that they already had lined up two very large equity investors eager to own the majority of the project My mind went back to prior conversations where management also had said their 25 equity would include the assets and land at Lake Charles which ET would contribute to the dealThus if the project ends up costing about 12 billion and ET expects to own 25 then ET might need to invest 3 billion during the time frame required to build the facility But possibly half or a third of their 3 billion might be counted on as the assets and land already constructed at Lake Charles site so in truth this project may only cost ET about 15 to 2 billion while the finished project would be a hugely valuable contribution to the entirety of the company Mgmts comments last night made sense and I started to relax as I began thinking about the numbers furtherWith managements EBITDA guidance for 2023 staying at roughly 1325 billion for the full year I suddenly realized again that ET management was excited about growth and might have good reason to be but they also were taking for granted that we investors all understood that ET was generating SO MUCH cas,280,2023-08-03,0,0.9981,0.37499997656250145

159,159,NextEra Energy Partners Makes For A Great Prospect Following Its Plunge,The past few days have not been particularly pleasant for shareholders of renewable energy company   Over the span of only two trading days shares of the enterprise dropped 349 with the market reacting inBack in May of this year the management team at NextEra Energy Partners  that the company would be going through a significant change aimed at simplifying the firms operational structure and moving the company in the direction of being a pureplay investment in the renewable energy market I wont spend too much time on this specifically simply because it is old news But it is relevant to the current conversation So a bit of discussion is warrantedAt present NextEra Energy Partners owns two primary sets of assets Some of these assets are natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure But these assets account for only a small portion of the companys revenue In fact in the  of the 2023 fiscal year the enterprise derived only 174 of its sales from these particular assets The rest of its revenue came from its ownership interests in various renewable energy assets Wind projects comprise the bulk of its production capacity In the most recent quarter for which data is available the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year its wind assets were responsible for the production of 7406MW of power Thats up 366 compared to the 5420MW produced the same time last year Solar is also another category that management is focused on In fact during the second quarter of this year alone the company made acquisitions totaling both wind and solar projects amounting to 690MW It does engage in some battery storage activities as well but that represents only a small portion of the firms focusThe plan that management announced earlier this year calls for it to over the next couple of years sell off its pipeline assets Using those proceeds the company wants to both simplify its corporate structure by buying out certain convertible equity portfolio financings and using any excess proceeds from said asset sales to fuel further growth in the renewable energy space At the end of the day managements goal is to turn NextEra Energy Partners into a pureplay renewable energy providerWhen management made this announcement they claimed that it was the companys goal to continue prioritizing distributions for the common shareholders And they believed that they could continue to grow the limited partner distributions per unit at a rate of between 12 and 15 per annum for the next few years In fact the company even extends this out to 2026 If the firm had been able to achieve this kind of target it would take distributions per unit from 325 last year to between 511 and 568 per unit in 2026 However the picture has since changed drasticallyOn September 27th management issued a  in which it said that the company was revising down its growth expectations for the next few years Instead of targeting distribution per unit growth of between 12 and 15 per annum they are now targeting growth of between 5 and 8 per annum The ultimate  is to hit around 6 which is in the lower half of the range This marks a drastic departure from the companys initial plan In the chart below you can see how the low high and target projections for distribution growth impact the total distribution per share of the company on an annual basis over the next few years You can also see that stacked up against the  that is also shown in the image above Even in the most optimistic case by 2026 we are looking at a distribution disparity of at least 101 per share That adds up and even with the current share count of the company which will actually increase to an extra 93 million a year that wont be paid out to shareholders But when you factor in future share issuances that disparity will likely be far higherManagements announcement likely has a lot to do with how the economy is and the opportunities that exist out,82,2023-10-01,0,0.9974,0.0

171,171,Energy Transfer: Dividend May Come Under Fire,Energy Transfer LP  is a massive company in the natural gas space With a market cap of over 43 billion its a behemoth in the energy sector Much of the appeal of the company has come from the high dividend it currentlyOne of Energy Transfers most crucial roles is its extensive involvement in the movement of energy resources Notably the company plays a central role in the transportation of approximately 30 of the United States natural gas supply underscoring its indispensable contribution to the nations energy infrastructure Furthermore Energy Transfer is responsible for conveying around 35 of the nations crude oil highlighting its stature as a key player in the energy sectorGiven that a large asset base of ET is the pipelines and infrastructure for transportation of both oil and gas a very good metric to look at the performance of the business is the ROA For ET this means a steady increase over the last couple of years But we see a dip in late 2020 as the price of natural gas reached some very low levels For reference the gross property plant  equipment for ET is right now valued at 109 billion a significant increase from the 79 billion it was in 2018reached below 162 and resulted in ET posting a negative ROA It should be said that oil futures also went negative during 2020 Specifically for the latter part of 2020 the prices were around 45 but have since doubled ET has been able to increase its ROA rapidly over the last few years showcasing the strength of its asset base and ability to outgrow some of the momentum of commodity prices I think this is why the market is giving it a slight earnings premium right now as the stability of ROA is visibleI mentioned earlier that the asset base or more specifically the pipelines that ET has has rapidly increased since 2018 During this period the ROIC has also improved very well This has come as commodity prices have increased and the heavy investments that ET made into their infrastructure and pipelines have been paying offAs for the coming expansion of the business I think that it will come from acquiring more companies The latest one is around Crestwood with a deal valued at 71 billion The cash for ET is only 330 million right now so they will have to take on a significant amount of debt to fund this  It is a bet that natural gas prices will continue to improve and once the debt they take on now matures EBITDA will be high enough to cover it For the long term I agree that natural gas prices will appreciate For a more stable financial position though I would have preferred a higher cash position before making a transaction like thisOne of the main appeals of ET is the dividend The company has a history of paying out a very high yield which right now is above 9The payout ratio for ET has historically been very very high Right now sitting at over 90 Since we know that the earnings of the business are quite tied to the commodity prices betting on a higher dividend is betting on higher commodity prices as well What I am slightly worried about is the potential lack of increases in the coming years for ET Natural gas prices have been cut heavily from the highs in 2022 and it seems like there will be a slow climb upwardWhen the commodity prices collapsed in 2020 the dividend for ET was cut Looking back it was a good move as the company would have been unable to pay out the nearly 3 billion in dividends with an FCF of under 200 million and negative net income What I think this highlights though is the susceptibility that the dividends have to commodity price volatility Oil prices have heavily appreciated in the last few months and sit above 90 If global production starts to increase again prices may decrease and ET could potentially see stagnating EPS growthBetween 2013 and 2018 the dividend increased from 016 to 031 every quarter a nearly 100 increase A majority of the for ET is from natural gas and during th,181,2023-08-07,0,0.9971,-0.23809522675737013

175,175,Energy Transfer's Massive Purchase Of Crestwood Equity Partners Makes Sense,August 16th ended up being a monumental day for both   and   Shares of both companies rose after news broke that the former had Digging into the details I found that there are solid financial and operational reasons why such a deal has been made As a shareholder of Energy Transfer with the company making up my secondlargest holding with 129 of my overall portfolio I am a big fan of any deal that brings value for shareholders Certainly the price paid for the business was attractive  though personally I would have preferred the transaction involved at least some cash given how discounted shares of Energy Transfer are But in the grand scheme of things this is only a small complaint and the overall picture for both firms movingOn August 16th the management team at Energy Transfer  that it had reached an agreement to acquire Crestwood in an allstock transaction with an implied enterprise value of nearly 71 billion For each share of Crestwood that an investor has they will receive 207 shares of Energy Transfer when the transaction closes in the final quarter of this year Based on the price that shares of Energy Transfer was trading at immediately before the transaction was announced this would imply an equity value of 275 billion To get up to the 71 billion of enterprise value we add 325 billion of net debt 4342 million of noncontrolling interests and 650 million of preferred stock that Crestwood hasThis price does not really represent any premium for shareholders of Crestwood The implied buyout price works out to approximately 26 per share using the price that shares of Energy Transfer were trading at on August 15th Even so that did not stop Crestwood stock from climbing 46 for the day while shares of Energy Transfer popped higher by about 17 It is unclear why Crestwood is trading at a premium to the buyout price but this usually means that the market anticipates some other firm stepping in with an offerAs you can see in the  above the two companies do have some rather substantial overlap in terms of the assets that they have in operation Beyond any doubt Energy Transfer is the larger of the two as made clear by the 4033 billion market capitalization of the company So this means that its physical footprint is also substantially larger The assets that seem to be particularly appealing to Energy Transfer are those focused on the Williston and Delaware basins that should complement the acquirers downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu and its hydrocarbon export capabilities in both Texas and PennsylvaniaThere are of course other assets that Crestwood would bring to the table that are valuable to the company For instance it opens up the door to the Powder River basin because of the gathering and processing system that Crestwood has located there Combining the storage and logistics business that Crestwood has with Energy Transfers NGL refined products and crude oil assets pave the way for operational synergies The location of oil and gas exploration and production drilling and completion activities as well as operations geographically close to the assets that Crestwood has opens the door for various growth prospects including management said the potential to make bolton acquisitionsAnother reason for this deal is the financial side of matters For starters Energy Transfer believes that it can capture around 40 million in annual run rate cost synergies from the deal And that is even before factoring in the benefit from potential revenue growth Even though this may not sound like much when compared to the 300 million in core costs that Crestwood incurs each year that is a rather sizable amount of capital on a relative basis Management also indicated that some synergies could come from debt refinancing in the years to come Over the next five years Crestwood should have around 11 billion worth of debt coming up for refinancing or repaym,14,2023-10-09,0,0.9977,0.0

180,180,Energy Transfer: Still Dirt Cheap And Staying The Course,On August 2nd the management team at midstreampipeline operator   announced financial results covering the second quarter of the companys 2023 fiscal year On both its top and bottom lines the business missed expectations But when youAt first glance the  reported by management may look very bad Revenue for instance came in at 1832 billion for the quarter That represents A decline of 294 over the 2595 billion management reported the same quarter last year It was also 208 billion lower than what analysts  As I recently discussed in another  regarding rival   revenue really is not that significant for companies in this space Rather margin and volumes transported tend to be the most significant drivers of valueWhen you look at the volume data the picture for the company was quite attractive Natural gas volumes transported under the Intrastate Transportation and Storage segment of the company for instance grew by 25 year over year thanks to increased utilization involving its Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission system as well as higher natural gas production from the Haynesville Shale Even though revenue for the company plummeted from 220 billion to only 807 million segment EBITDA dipped only slightly from 218 million to 216 million Even though margins were negatively affected to the tune of 44 million because of lower natural gas prices and by 5 million due to realized natural gas sales as well as pipeline optimization these were offset in part by higher transportation fees thanks to new contracts and an increase in storage margin caused by favorable storage optimizationAnother big driver behind the revenue decline was the Midstream segment Gathered volumes for the company shot up 83 year over year while the volume of NGLs produced grew 62 Even so revenue was cut by more than half from 505 billion to 247 billion Volume increases naturally came about because of higher demand for its products under this segment and because of its acquisition of Woodford Express This was one area where margin did contract rather significantly dropping from 903 million to 579 million But outside of this the picture for the company was very positiveFor instance an increase of 226 when it comes to crude transportation volumes under the Crude Oil Transportation Services segment accompanied by a 152 rise in volumes involving the companys crude terminal activities as well as higher margins associated with this segment sent segment EBITDA up from 562 million to 674 million Similar improvements can be seen by looking at both the NGL and Refined Products Transportation and Services segment and the Interstate Transportation and Storage segmentIt is worth noting that this did not stop the company from seeing a decline in profits year over year Earnings per share dropped from 039 in the second quarter of last year to only 025 per share the same time this year That actually missed analysts forecasts by 007 per share Put another way profits went from 122 billion down to 797 million But again this is not a metric that is all that valuable for a business like Energy Transfer Whats really valuable would be the cash flow data And although the company did demonstrate some weakness from that perspective that weakness was mild compared to the revenue and profit declines Operating cash flow for instance did manage to rise from 235 billion to 254 billion But after adjusting for changes in working capital the increase turned to a decrease from 277 billion to 245 billion DCF or distributable cash flow went from 188 billion to 155 billion And finally EBITDA for the company slipped only modestly from 323 billion to 312 billionTo some investors any decrease at all may be perceived as a negative But when you really dig into the picture in its entirety things are going quite well For the 2023 fiscal year as a whole management is forecasting EB,149,2023-08-05,0,0.9918,-0.36842103324099823

182,182,Valero Energy: A Solid Q3 With A Powerful Buyback In Place,Shares of Valero  have essentially tread water over the past year lagging the broader market gain After reporting Q3 results on Thursday shares fell about 1 in what has been a down day for the overall market WithIn the companys  Valero earned 749 which beat  by 017 The first thing to highlight is that net income fell from 28 to 26 billion but EPS rose by 030 from 719 That is the power of the companys capital return policy With earnings particularly high VLO has been aggressively buying back stock It returned 22 billion to shareholders last quarter with a 360 million quarterly dividend and the balanceOver time VLO targets a capital return policy of 4050 of operating cash flow Last quarter though it returned 60 of operating cash flow to investors This is not because cash flow has fallen to a troubling degree rather cash margins have been so strong that VLO has been generating excess cash well beyond its investment needs which it then is returning That 4050 is intended to be a cycle average However the dramatic share count reduction will mean EPS will outperform net income as we saw last quarter Since 2012 VLO has bought back nearly 40 of the companyLooking at Q3 results refining operating income was down 400 million to 34 billion Its refineries ran at a solid 95 utilization even with some maintenance work With that work complete management is expecting to run at a 965 utilization rate in Q4 as product demand has stayed strong with diesel inventories being relatively tight still With investments to modernize refineries over the past ten years VLO has been able to increase utilization and lower operating costs leaving it with a cost advantaged system and boosting marginsValero earned a margin per barrel of oil of 1947 from 2143 last year On a percentage basis refining margins actually expanded to 94 from 9 as crude oil prices were lower but that decline in dollar margin per barrel is what caused earnings from this unit to fall from last year We will discuss refinery margins further in a momentBriefly though VLO has two smaller units Its renewable diesel unit generated operating income of 123 million from 212 million last year While sales were up a third as expansion projects came online diesel margins compressed from last year While still healthy diesel markets were extremely tight last year as Europe scrambled for fuel after turning away from Russian oil This unit is operating at more of a normal level nowOn the other side ethanal operating income rose to 197 million from 1 million last year with production up over 20 Corn prices are lower than a year ago outpacing the decline in crude oil which has helped to widen margins While these renewable energy businesses provide some earnings 9095 of Valeros results come from its core refining business Refining margins more so than renewable diesel or ethanol are what will drive the stockIt has been a bull market for refining since shortly after COVID 321 spreads which measure how much refiners get for their refined products gasoline diesel relative to the crude oil input soared This is why Valeros profits surged and it has been able to buy back so much stock Now these margins have been to normalize A reason VLO trades at such a low multiple is markets are viewing some of its 20barrel margin as a onetime windfall rather than a recurring source of income The onetime windfall is definitely good for shareholders but VLO will never get a 15x multiple on peak earningsA question then is where do margins go over time in other words what is Valeros true runrate earnings power At the current share count and with its 23 tax rate if we cut Valeros refining margins in half it would have runrate earnings of 375share or about 1415year That would leave the stock with just an 85x multiple Right now per the analyst consensus earnings are  to decline to 1551 n,5,2023-10-27,0,0.9309,0.14285713265306196
