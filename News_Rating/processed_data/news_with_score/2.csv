0,0,Billionaire Ray Dalio Says '50% Chance Of World War' - How To Invest?,Billionaire Hedge Fund tycoon Ray Dalio  in a recent LinkedIn  titled Another Step Toward International War  offered some sobering takeaways from the escalating geopolitical conflicts involving Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine Dalio underscored that these are notIn this article we will look further at his reasoning behind this stark assertion evaluate the potential damage that such a conflict would cause to the global economy and share how weMr Dalios thesis draws on parallels between the current geopolitical climate and the periods preceding the two World Wars in the 20th century He emphasizes that the IsraelHamas and RussiaUkraine conflicts have transitioned from prehotwar conflicts to uncontained hot wars which will likely be brutal and protracted until one side decisively triumphs over the other Furthermore Dalio warns that these conflicts have the potential to spread and escalate involving more countries and potentially leading to a world war if major powers like the US and China are drawn into direct conflict with each otherHe believes that the conflicts involving Israel Hamas Ukraine and Russia are  just like in the periods preceding the past two world wars  symptomatic of larger great power conflicts that will significantly impact countries allied with these nations He suggests that the US is already indirectly engaged in these conflicts fighting proxy wars in Europe and the Middle East while also preparing for potential conflict in East Asia The spreading of these wars will not only be costly but will also risk drawing noncombatant nations into the fray thereby expanding the scope and scale of the conflictsIn terms of solutions Dalios idealistic pipe dream would be for world leaders to recognize the catastrophic potential of hot wars and collaboratively establish pathways and processes to minimize the chances of such conflicts developing Apart from that increasingly unlikely solution materializing however it appears to be only a matter of time before hot conflict between the worlds major military and economic powers breaks outFor stock market investors the implications of a global war would likely be devastating The escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the potential for them to spiral into a larger more widespread war could introduce significant volatility and risk into global marketsWhile the death and destruction that such a global conflict would cause are reason enough to shudder at the idea that they are growing increasingly likely the economic fallout would be catastrophic as well given how interconnected the global economy has become A war pitting China against the United States and undoubtedly involving Taiwan as well is anticipated to unleash severe repercussions on the global economy and some  put the damage at a 5 contraction of the 23 trillion US economy marking the worst decline since the Great Depression The stock markets in the US and around the world would undoubtedly crash likely surpassing even the 50 drop in the SP 500  and Nasdaq  witnessed during the 20072009 Great Financial Crisis and recession If the market capitalization of the SP 500 were to be halved it would wipe out around 18 trillion in wealth which is equivalent to roughly twothirds of the United States current GDP Some  even put a 10 GDP decline as probable in this scenario which equates to a 25 trillion hit to annual economic output triggering mass layoffs and plummeting consumption ratesOf course a significant casualty in this conflict that would drive much of the global economic chaos in its wake would be the semiconductor industry given that Taiwan is a critical player in global semiconductor production  A major disruption of Taiwans semiconductor exports to the worlds major economies is estimated to potentially eliminate 16 trillion in corporate annual revenue Moreover the supply chain restructuring required in response to a potential ,188,2023-10-16,2,-0.9985,-0.8604650962682536

2,2,Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte: Analyzing The Fee Change Impact (Rating Upgrade),In  last month about Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte  I mentioned while giving a Buy rating that one of the risks associated with the company and airportsAnd on October 5th this risk materialized causing a drop of between 30 and 40 in all Mexican airport stocks In this article I will discuss the news that shook this group of stocks and the effects it will have on OMABs revenue Additionally I will explain why last week was that the Mexican government intended to change the formula that establishes price limits on fees for the use of airports which are typically charged to passengers This fee is called the Tarifa de Uso de Aeropuerto TUA in Spanish or the  AUF in English and it is only paid by domestic passengersWhile this is something positive for passengers  I say this as a Mexican who usually takes flights within the country and is aware of the complaints that Mexicans make about the AUF  it may not be as positive for airport revenues and could result in a considerable loss There is still no official statement from any of the parties involved but the newspaper called  that this reduction could be around 8 or lets call it 10 for arguments sake During FY2022 59 of OMABs revenues came from Aeronautical Services which include the  that are planned to be modified Of this percentage 68 came from domestic passenger charges themselves so the remaining 32 would not be affected at least not initiallyThen the FY2022 distribution of revenues look like thisIf we consider the 10 reduction that the newspaper El Financiero mentioned in  they reported an 8 reduction but lets be conservative then these revenues would have been 432 billion MXN Therefore total revenues for FY2022 after factoring in this 10 reduction in  would amount to 1145 billion MXN representing a 4 decrease compared to reported revenues This does not seem to justify a 25 drop in just 5 daysI understand that the decline in shares may be more related to the precedent this situation could set with concerns that Mexico might follow the path of countries like China or Russia where the government significantly intervenes in business operations However its important to note that the proposed change appears to be minimal in terms of business impact and we still do not have official confirmation or details on whether negotiations could alter the conditions At this point these developments could be based on rumorsIn my previous valuation I mentioned that I considered it feasible for revenues to grow by 12 annually in the coming years However to account for the factors discussed above lets make a 4 adjustment to the growth rateThis adjustment would result in an annual growth rate of 8 If we apply valuation multiples of 10x EBITDA and 15x earnings this would translate to an annualized return of 21 from the current share price of 150 MXN in the Mexican Stock Exchange Bolsa de Valores MexicanaThe investment thesis has not changed and one could argue that it has become even more attractive This is due to the news causing valuations to drop to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis and the worst of 2020 when the economy came to a standstill and airports had no traffic due to the lockdownThe risks remain consistent with those I mentioned in  However in this case we have already witnessed how the stock can react when one of these risks materializes The key question here is whether you believe that this government action sets a precedent for what we might expect in the future or if it is a relatively minor adjustment within reason In my case I tend to believe the latter because this change would only represent around 4 in the companys revenue assuming the worst case scenario in one of the companies with the greatest exposure to Passenger Charges revenues companies like NYSE  of their revenues exposed to this segment while NYSE has  of their Aeronautical Services Revenues ,18,2023-10-09,7,-0.8394,-0.4999999687500019

17,17,How The U.S. Government Shutdown Could Impact REITs,The US Government appears  for a shutdown In this article I discuss four potential ramifications that it might have on the REIT sector  and then share how I am working to mitigate thisPerhaps the impact that investors are most concerned about is how a government shutdown might impact interest rates One of the biggest ways it could potentially do this is by disrupting the release of key US economic data ie employment and inflation reports making it harder for markets to judge where monetary policy and interest rates in particular may be headed next As a result investors and policymakers alike may have to rely on nongovernment data potentially affecting Federal Reserve rate decisionsAs a result it is very possible that  should the Federal Reserve lack sufficientAdditionally Moodys has  a government shutdown could prove to be a creditnegative event which would likely cause longterm interest rates to rise Given that REITs are general interest rate sensitive  as evidenced by their steep decline since interest rates began rising in 2022  any scenario that may push interest rates higher would definitely be a negative catalyst for themAnother major potential impact on REITs from a government shutdown is a disruption of some transactions For example oftentimes federal agencies are needed for regulatory approvals on matters pertaining to real estate transactions During a government shutdown these agencies will likely be either understaffed or even closed entirely As a result major commercial real estate transactions could potentially be delayedAnother disruption could be to development projects as there are times when government approvals are needed for development projects to move forward This is particularly true when the development involves major public infrastructure that in some way involves the federal governmentFinally the financing required for some real estate transactions depends on federal loans subsidies andor grants A government shutdown could delay or even prevent the disbursement of these fundsThe net effect of this on REITs is that it could lead to a slowing of growth rates for some REITs if the government shutdown were to last for an extended period of timeAnother potential major impact of a government shutdown on the REIT sector is that it could shake investor and consumer confidence thereby hurting REIT share prices access to capital leasing demand and even potentially the economic strength of REIT tenants If the government is unable to function at its normal pace many businesses  especially those who do business with the government  may become more cautious with their spending and investment decisions This can have a secondhand impact on REITs by reducing demand for commercial real estate thereby leading to reduced leasing activity and property valuesMoreover commercial real estate investors may perceive government shutdowns as a sign of political instability or economic uncertainty thereby reducing their appetite for longterm real estate investments This could then lead to less debt and equity capital being made available to REITsThese effects of these concerns  along with rising longterm interest rates  are already being seen in the broader market with major indexes like the SP 500  and especially capital intensive subsectors like utilities  pulling back sharply in recent weeksAs BlackRocks  CEO recently  of the potential shutdownThat said a government shutdown may not be all bad for REITs For example while several of the cons of a shutdown are discussed in this article a longterm benefit of the shutdown is that it could force the Congress to meaningfully slash its runaway deficit spending in order to make a deal to reopen the government thereby blunting the rapid rise of longterm interest ratesThis is because when the government engages in deficit spending it essentially means that it is spending more money than it collects i,30,2023-09-30,8,0.977,-0.8709677138397511
18,18,Rising Instability And Its Market Impacts,This piece revisits the current US fiscal debt and deficit system in light of the ongoing problems in the US bond market and explores some investment themes amid this very macro heavy environmentLong duration bonds have enduredIve been bearish on bonds for a number of years now see  from July 2019  from April 2020 and  from August 2020 but the nominal degree of this drawdown over the subsequent 34 years has been surprising even to meI think the main part of this drawdown is mostly done for the time being and TIPS are looking interesting here with their positive real yields but the overall fiscal picture remains highly problematicIn various fields of engineering such as control engineering or mechanical structural design the concept of  is very important and it means something quite specificA system is either stable unstable or marginal as shown by the pictures aboveA  system has a bounded output that reduces over time when given a bounded input It tends towards calmness If you hit a metal beam with a force for example the resulting vibrations in the beam will diminish in intensity over time If you have an electromagnet and sensor system trying to  by measuring the position of the ball and automatically varying the power of the magnet accordingly a stable system will be able to reduce the balls oscillations until it hovers motionless If you poke the ball with a small force it will oscillate a bit from the dislocation and then return to calmnessA  system has a bounded output that remains in motion when given a bounded input In other words the system might keep oscillating but the oscillations wont get worse It would be like if you poke a levitating metal ball and it just keeps oscillating but still able to levitate there The control system is keeping it in check but is unable to get it back to calmness Every time it applies a magnetic force it slightly overshoots and then when it pulls back on the magnetic force it slightly undershoots and so the ball keeps getting pushed around but not getting worseAn  system has an unbounded output when given a bounded input The oscillations will keep getting bigger like how if you push a child on a swing at the perfect time while she is already starting to travel in the direction of the prior push then you can apply a pattern of pushes that keeps her going higher and higher each time even though your push strength doesnt change The inputs are  into a larger and larger output oscillation This is how a singer can shatter a wine glass with her voice if applied to the glasss mechanical resonance frequency or how soldiers marching over a bridge can collapse the bridge if their unified footsteps match the bridges mechanical resonance frequencyWhen thinking about the financial system of a developed country like the United States our mental model generally views them as marginal systems a series of oscillations that stay within the same overall bounds Sometimes debt levels go up and sometimes we need to tighten our belts so that debt levels go down Sometimes the central bank tightens monetary policy and sometimes it loosens it The financial system in other words is thought of as being similar to how it was 20 or 40 years agoBut in reality most financial systems are  They have an unbounded output in the sense that sovereign debt as a  of GDP keeps growing over time Fortunately the frequency of these systems is very long so it takes decades for problematic levels of instability to build up to the point where the output gets out of controlWhen it does get out of control the system needs to be reset recapitalized or restructured in some way In other words sovereign bondholders lose purchasing power through nominal default or more commonly through inflation To use the control system analogy the oscillations get out of control the electromagnet drops the ball and it has to be picked back up and put back in with ,172,2023-10-18,3,0.9834,-0.26315788088642733

30,30,Connecting FFO To DPS For REITs,A Real Estate Investment Trust or REIT is a special kind of publicly traded company To paraphrase  these are firms that own operate or finance incomegenerating real estateBecause they are so focused on real estate theyre tough to directlyThese kinds of transactions often represent onetime events that greatly affect a REITs earnings but which doesnt communicate the performance of the recurring income they collect from rents on the properties they own This recurring income provides the revenue stream that generates the dividend income that REIT investors earn from the shares they ownTo address that problem theThese adjustments make sense because dividend income plays a big role in why investors would seek to own stocks in REITs Some REITs will make additional adjustments to further account for other capitalized expenditures that dont involve buying or selling real estate assets such as for renovations They identify these as Adjusted Funds From Operations or AFFO and report them along with the REIT industrys standard FFO figuresNow that weve provided that background what makes the FFO information valuable to investors is its correlation with the dividends paid out by REITs To show how valuable we pulled the quarterly trailingyear Dividend Per Share  and FFO per share data for the worlds largest REIT according to its market capitalization   and plotted them against each other in the following From 2013Q4 through the justreported 2023Q2 we find theres a very strong correlation between this REITs core trailingyear FFO and its trailing year dividends per share where the FFO explains 9865 of the dividends it has paid out over the past decade What makes that relationship especially valuable is that REITs will provide guidance for what to expect for their FFO In Prologis case its guidance for 2023 can be found in the firms  for its recently reported Prologis fullyear guidance is that it expect its FFO will fall somewhere between 556 and 560 per share in 2023 Since Prologis just reported its trailingyear FFO for 2023Q2 was 602 per share the company is signaling its FFO is likely to decline in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 That forecast makes it unlikely it will boost its dividends during the first quarter of 2024 as it has in recent yearsWeve used the relationship between Prologis FFO and dividends per share to show what the firms dividend payout would be should its managements forecast fall in the middle of their indicated fullyear range For an AFFO of 558 per share the companys trailingyear dividends would be 331 which is less than the 348 dividend it is on track to pay out this yearThat negative outlook then explains our  showing the relationship between Prologis share price and its trailingyear dividends per shareThis chart shows Prologis share price is well below the level its historical relationship with the companys dividends per share suggests it should be Given Prologis implied negative outlook for its FFO in the rest of 2023 thats probably to be expected Without the FFO growth to support it its hard to see any kind of dividend increase in the offingPerhaps that will change as the rest of 2023 plays out How likely is that with the year already half over We hold no position of any kind in PLD Weve only chosen it for this analysis because the logisticswarehousing REIT is the largest by market cap in the US stock market and because the relationship between its FFO per share and dividends per share is interesting The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser,4,2023-08-18,8,0.9943,0.09090908264462885

57,57,Eurobank's Financial Return: A Herculean Task Nearing Completion,I last wrote about Eurobank  back in 2018 in an article titled  Since that article was published I followed my own advice and continued addingStill trading at a conservative PE of 472 the banks stock price has the potential to double over the next 12 months and still be at a small discount Although it is not the great discount than it was when I originally wrote about it Eurobank remains a compelling opportunityAs a Seeking Alpha contributor I often seek to uncover hidden gems in the market This search often takes me acrossIt takes years for the market to forget bad news and the cloud that hung over Greek banks was quite thick It has taken almost a decade for investors to become interested in Greek banks because the Greek debt collapse was so destructive to shareholder value After the 2009 crisis Greek banks lost over 99 of their valueThe view on Greece has changed recently and the country is no longer the economic joke of the Eurozone This recent headline  from The Greek Reporter shows how sentiment regarding Greece has shiftedWith the Greek financial crisis now far behind us in our rearview mirror the economy is showing signs of stability and recovery providing a fertile ground for savvy investors to seize value Although this recovery has taken almost a decade much like Heracles aka Hercules Greek banks had to undertake their own difficult tasks Now many difficult tasks have been accomplished by the government and Greek businessesFor Eurobank revenue has been growing over the last decade from a negative in 2015 to over 3 billion in each of the last two years Earnings per share has grown 005 to 039 over the last five years You can find more detail  in the income statement Over the past year investors have begun to see the value and the stock has appreciated over 120 but it is still selling at a discountI do think that some form of a discount in Eurobanks stock price and earnings multiple is warranted but how much is too much Even much maligned Deutsche Bank  trades at a PE of 599 If you applied the same PE to Eurobank it would trade at 234 an almost 280 gainFor these reasons we believe that a safe range target of 2312 is fair if everything stays the same But what happens if earnings continue to grow and a multiple of 1015 becomes earned due to improved expectations This included with our very conservative estimate of 3rd quarter revenue increasing by 50 million leads us to be optimistic For the year this could improve earnings per share to around 045 At a ten times multiple that is 450 a share and at a 15x multiple that would be 675 This leads me to believe that shares are currently still very undervalued If nothing changes we believe Eurobank is worth at least 2 If fortune shines on us Eurobank could be worth as much as 675I know this ignores the fact that something very bad could happen in Greece or to the Greek economy When investing one must understand that the worst can happen and occasionally does Eurobank could go bankrupt again Banks have proven time and again that they will blow themselves up occasionally if given the capital and the latitude It is important to remember the pain of the previous collapse that has been forgotten For this reason I would consider buying a small position in a welldiversified portfolioFor those of us that are buying in 2018 for 028 I think we are playing with house moneyThe Conservative Government has won the right to start a second four year term which you can read about  Their leadership has seen the unemployment rate fall year over yearThese tailwinds partially explains the great results posted recently by Eurobank which has emerged as a potentially strong investment target thanks to their strong performance across all business lines in the ninemonth periodThe recent 3rd quarter earnings call found  provided some interesting highlights which I will share belowThe third quarter witnesse,4,2023-07-31,3,0.868,-0.35999998560000057
58,58,Cheniere Energy: A Strong Hedge Against Renewed Geopolitical Instability,As new catalysts impact financial markets some investors are likely looking for stocks that act as a potential hedge against crucial risk factors Events in Israel over the past week are a significant risk factor that can impact financial markets ifThe LNG market has boomed over the past two years due to the RussiaUkraine war causing Europe to dramatically lower its imports from Russia while increasing its LNG imports from the  European natural gas prices were extremely high in 2022 butIn the past I was  because the stock appeared to have downside risk due to falling LNG prices in Europe Europes natural gas and LNG prices have continued to slide since then causing its quarterly EPS to decline from over 20 per share in Q1 to just 560 in Q2 As contracts continue to roll its Q3 profits may be even lower due to lower LNG prices today potentially making Cheniere Energy overvalued That said the stock rocketed up by around 8 in value over the past week in response to the geopolitical crisis Accordingly I believe it is a critical time to take a closer look at Chenieres exposures and the global LNG market to determine if its outlook has improved or is merely reacting to fear and hypeThe natural gas price in Europe primarily drives the US price of LNG because most US LNG flows to Europe today Europes LNG demand was extremely high in 2022 as it raced to secure new sources of its primary power source leading to an extreme increase in its natural gas prices US LNG prices also rose dramatically up to 9 over the base price of natural gas However since its supplies have normalized the spread between LNG and natural gas has normalized and is now back at 380 roughly its typical historical level See belowEuropes natural gas price has moderated tremendously from last years level as fears of a shortage have declined Warm winter weather last year and slower economic growth in Europe benefited the market by pushing demand lower Europes natural gas price is currently  roughly 16MMBTU While Europes natural gas price is much lower than it was being briefly over 300MWH it has doubled since summer when it was just  25MWH Crucially Europes natural gas price soared by 40 this week due to concerns regarding Middle Eastern natural gas supplies as Europe is more dependent on the Middle East today after losing Russian sourcesStill Europes natural gas storage level is extremely high today pushing up against its capacity level Europe has more natural gas today than at any point over the past five years and is significantly above the average seasonal level See belowEurope is going into withdrawal season in a robust position European weather forecasts also  of warmer weather  lowering demand throughout the season So aside from geopolitical risks to Europes natural gas supply the continents demand for US LNG should not be exceptionally high today One bullish factor not particularly geopolitical is the increasing demand for LNG from  countries actively looking to move away from coal As Asian demand continues to grow while Europe may not see a return in Russian gas flows any time soon there is reason to believe US LNG export prices will remain elevated or at least not decline significantly Additionally  may soon go on strike amid an increase in global labor issues potentially limiting some future LNG supply worldwideThat said multiple geopolitical pressures could increase US LNG export prices For one the undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia is believed to have been deliberately  planning to respond if a culprit is found This potential attack occurred one year after the initial Nord Stream 1  after Finland joined NATO Further the secondlargest European LNG provider is Qatar which recently signed longterm LNG export contracts with European countries Those deals quickly became scrutinized because Qatar is widely seen as a  leadersOf course there are also direct pr,3,2023-10-13,2,0.8885,-0.5454545206611581

66,66,GDX: Gold Miners Under Pressure From Rising Costs And Falling Revenues,Over the past three years volatility has caused many investors to flock toward alternative inflation hedge assets Gold performed very well during the initial government stimulus programs and QE efforts in 2020 Since then it has not held its weight primarily due to rising interest ratesMy perspective on precious metals has not proven correct since it was published The critical difference between my precious metals outlook and the markets reality isMost gold miners such as those in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF  are trading back near historical lows erasing all gains since 2020 after losing a quarter of their value over the past six months Notably the price of gold has generally maintained a high level still over a third above its preCOVID range at 1815oz Thus the weakness in gold miners may be attributable to either PE valuation declines or a sharp increase in gold mining costs Given this I believe it is an excellent opportunity to take another look at gold and gold miners to assess the markets rebound potential better or to revise my previous outlookWhile gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation it is better understood as a hedge against interest rates and the inflation outlook For example in 2020 gold soared in value due to  inflation and a sharp decline in the carrying value of fiat currency ie lower interest rates Today expected future inflation has moderated considerably while the carrying value of fiat currency is exceptionally high making the money market a much higheryielding investment than gold after inflationFundamentally gold and inflationlinked Treasury bonds are real assets but gold differs by paying no interest after inflation Thus gold is effectively discounted to the real interest rate There is a robust inverse correlation between the real Treasury rate and the price of gold See belowOf course gold is also an inflation hedge so it is most accurate to measure the real interest rate vs the inflationadjusted price of gold Gold is still nearly as expensive today as it was in 2020 but its value in inflationadjusted terms has declined a bit due to the rise in prices Accounting for this makes the gold and realrate relationship even stronger on a fundamental basis See below the inflationadjusted gold price unit is arbitrary since it uses the CPI For example todays price of gold is 634 X the CPI currently 306Using these data I calculated a relatively consistent inverse correlation of 08 between the two metrics over the past fifteen years The slope on linear regression is 093 with a 607 intercept Again these numbers have little meaning since the units are arbitrary but they can be used to calculate the price of gold based on real interest rates and the CPI today With a 245 real yield an extremely high figure the inflationadjusted fair value of gold based on this simple model is 38 times the CPI or 1163ozObviously that is an extremely low price compared to the current price of gold However around 20062007 the 10year real yield was around 245 and the price of gold was 650oz In todays dollars that would be roughly 1010oz indicating the same model would have  the price of gold back then Based on this model we expect gold to rise and fall by nearly 300oz for every 1 change in the 10year real interest rate on US Treasury bonds While this model is widely off today it is relatively accurate historically having an rsquared of around 63Without a doubt some variables could be added to the model that may make it more accurate and justify a higher price of gold today Still it is undoubtedly challenging to justify the current 1815oz gold price in light of the extremely high returns  inflation on 10year Treasury bonds For one gold may be overvalued due to excessive investor interest rising from public concern over black swan events and governmental issues since 2020 This is reflecte,16,2023-10-05,1,0.9959,-0.23809522675737013

74,74,Major Middle East Conflicts And The Stock Market: What History Teaches,To start the article with the most important message let me say that I am deeply troubled by the human tragedy caused by the Hamas Israel conflict Accordingly the movements of financial markets and the analysis of stock prices are of relatively minor significance comparedNevertheless my focus on writing for Seeking Alpha continued to anchor on financial commentary And following the events of what is happening in the Middle East I aim to provide investors with a reference analysis of how conflicts in the Middle East have historically impacted global markets  specifically stocks In that context I provide insights on how the SP 500  performed surrounding the key events 1 SixDay War ofConflicts in the Middle East can impact the SP 500 and global financial markets in several ways Firstly the Middle East is a major source of global oil production and any instability in the region can disrupt oil supplies leading to price spikes And as investors certainly know and understand higher oil prices can increase production costs for many SP 500 companies which affects their profitabilityRelating to being a key geography for oil supply and trade the Middle East plays also a crucial role in international trade For example the Suez Canal Egypt is one of the worlds most vital waterways connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea thus being of major importance for economies in Europe and Asia Similarly the Strait of Hormuz IranOman is arguably the worlds most important chokepoint for global oil trade with  of oil passing through the Strait every day about 20 of global demand In addition in the Middle East there are also many important global trade hubs for goods including the Port of Jebel Ali United Arab Emirates Port of Jeddah Saudi Arabia Port of Haifa Israel Doha Port Qatar and the Chabahar Port IranSo far the Hamas Israel conflict has not impacted the SP 500 much But markets are not entirely out of the woods yet Specifically investors should consider that conflicts in the Middle East have the potential to send tremors through the global political landscape with secondorder consequences affecting evolvement not only from key countries in the Middle East most notably Iran but also international countries with an interest in oil supply and political defensesupport agreements such as the US and ChinaPersonally I see two main scenarios that investors should watch to assess the impact of the war on markets In the first scenario the conflict remains confined to Gaza and Israel thus not affecting oil prices and the global economy much In the second scenario however the conflict spills over to neighboring countries like Lebanon and Syria perhaps also turning into a proxy war between Israel and Iran Such an outcome may easily disrupt global oil markets with Bloomberg Economics estimating that oil prices  to above 150 a barrel clearly bringing the potential to tip an already weakened global economy into a recessionWith that frame of reference it is worth noting that by Friday 13 October the price of oil Brent benchmark surged to its highest point since the onset of the IsraelHamas conflict surpassing 90 per barrel The US marker West Texas Intermediate also increased notably by 59 to 8769 per barrelNow lets see what history teachesLets start with the most notable direct example of a conflict involving Israel the SixDay War of 1967 Jun 5 1967  Jun 10 1967 The event in question was a brief but highly consequential conflict between Israel and several neighboring Arab states including Egypt Jordan and Syria resulting in a crushing victory for Israel While a significant geopolitical event the SixDay War did not have a notable or sustained impact on the SP 500 In fact as highlighted in the chart below the start of the war only led to a shortlived 510 selloff in the SP 500 which the index quickly recovered continuin,1,2023-10-16,2,-0.9862,-0.6363636074380178

79,79,Will The Fed Trigger Another Crisis Event?,As the narrative grows the risk of a  event in the economy increases Will the Fed trigger another crisis event While unknown the risk seems likely as the Feds  narrative isSuch is a question worth asking as we look back at the Feds history of previous monetary actions Such was a topic I discussed in  To witHistorically when the Fed hikes interest rates and yield curves invert someone inevitability pushes the But that is also the fallacy in the 1995 scenario the media is currently pinning its hopes on Indeed the economy did not slip into a recession however there were crisis events along the way More importantly the yield curve did not invert in 1995 However it inverted in 1998 and a recession followed roughly 24 months laterThe chart above shows that yield curve inversions occur roughly 1024 months before recognizing a recession or crisis event This is because it takes time for the  of higher borrowing costs to negatively impact the economyWhile the Fed hopes individuals will act rationally as they tighten monetary policy investors tend not to act that way But what the markets are likely missing is that we are not just talking about the Feds monetary policy decisions in isolationWe currently live in the most highly leveraged economic era in US history As of Q2 of 2023 the total measurable leverage in the economy is 97 trillion The entire economy is currently at 222 trillion so it requires 436 in debt for each 1 of economic growth Critically that level of debt has nearly doubled since 2008 when it stood at 54 trillion and the economy was roughly 16 trillion in value In other words in just 13 years the economic leverage rose from 338 per 1 of growth to 436 That massive surge in leverage was made possible by nearzero interest rates during that periodGiven the financial systems leverage the collision of debtfinanced activity with restrictive financial conditions will lead to weaker growth Historically such increases in financial conditions have always preceded recessionary onsets and crisis events Notably those events occurred at substantially lower levels of overall leverageIf we look at the annual rate of change in total system leverage versus changes in interest rates we find about a 36month lag from when rates increase to a crisis event Given that rates started to rise in 2021 such suggests the next crisis event will occur later in 2024As noted above confirmation of the timing of the next recession or crisis event in 2024 comes from the yield curve inversions Historically when yield curves invert the media proclaims a recession is coming However when it doesnt immediately manifest they assume its  We just arent there yet as the  has yet to take holdDue to the amount of stimulus injected into the economy and the stillelevated levels of money supply as a percentage of the economy the recessionary onset likely will be akin to the 2006 episodeSimply just because the collision of higher borrowing costs reduced money supply and slowing economic growth hasnt caused a crisis or recession yet doesnt mean it wontIn  we discussed how a crisis event is possible if interest rates rise the Fed tightens monetary policy or the economic recovery faltersMost importantly over the last decade the primary rationalization  Unfortunately with inflation elevated which shrinks profit margins and high interest rates valuations are likely a more significant issue than most suspectAs At the moment we dont know when the next  will arriveHowever it is only a function of time until the Feds higher for longer causes someone to push the big red button The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editorsAfter having been in the investing world for more than 25 years from private banking and investment management to private and venture capital I have pretty much been there and done that at one point or another I am currently ,19,2023-10-14,3,-0.5971,-0.9999999629629643
80,80,Buy Gold In October 2023: The Planets Are Aligning For Its Resurgence,ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista  yesterday thatIn this article we are going to look at the various factors that are aligning to lead to what we believe will be a resurgence for gold  in the coming months and yearsThe ongoing conflict in the Middle East has sent shockwaves through global markets with investors rushing to shield their portfolios from the ensuing uncertainty that the conflict may spread throughout the region and ultimately even lead to a conflict that embroils two major oil exporters in Iran and Saudi Arabia Gold with its historical precedent of being a safehaven asset has witnessed a significant jumpMoreover the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe between Russia and Ukraine and its Western Allies as well as the growing tensions in East Asia between North Korea and South Korea and between China and Taiwan  with the potential for catastrophic wars to erupt from any of those hot spots  provide additional incentive to own gold during these geopolitically volatile timesGold has traditionally been an  against inflation With the global economy experiencing significant volatility and uncertainty at the moment and various nations still trying to balance fighting off inflationary pressures with trying to avoid falling into recession gold looks like an increasingly prudent investmentDespite the gold price initially falling more than 11 from its May high due to the Feds hawkish outlook the precious metal still holds potential for price appreciation in the coming yearsAnd it has already begun to make a comeback in recent daysMoreover it seems probable that the US Government will continue its runaway deficit spending for the foreseeable future Consequently this will exert significant pressure on the Federal Reserve to eventually reduce interest rates potentially resulting in negative real interest rates in the long run As a result inflation rates are expected to surpass nominal interest rates creating a highly favorable scenario for gold over the long termAnother reason to be bullish on gold right now is that historically gold has demonstrated a pattern of delivering positive average returns of 071 and 13 in November and December respectively due in part to a rise in jewelry demand and a generally weaker dollar in December As a result if history is any guide buying gold in October could be a great riskadjusted moveThe recent surge in central bank purchases of gold underscores the precious metals enduring appeal amidst global economic and geopolitical tumult Central banks both from advanced economies and emerging marketdeveloping economies EMDE are amassing gold reserves at a pace not seen for over 50 years with these entities accounting for 34 of total gold demand in the third quarter of 2022 and their rapid pace of buying continuing into 2023This buying spree was likely prompted at least in part by the geopolitical upheaval caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant sanctions on Russia prompting a reevaluation of US dollar reserves vulnerability This is evidenced by the fact that 42 of banks anticipate a decline in US dollar holdings according to a World Gold Council  Furthermore nations like Russia and China have been aggressively purchasing gold potentially as a safeguard against foreign asset seizures EMDE banks often more proactive in their goldbuying endeavors than their Western counterparts clearly increasingly view gold not merely as a historical store of wealth but as a strategic asset that provides a buffer against potential payment crises arising from current or future sanctions and insulating their often more fragile economies against global financial crisesIf this strong central bank demand continues  which it is showing no signs of slowing down  it will likely provide a pretty strong tailwind for gold prices over the long termThanks to its multimillennia history of being a safehaven asset gold is once agai,39,2023-10-13,2,0.9808,-0.5384615177514801

83,83,"Petrobras: Political Risk Is Decreasing, Brace For Re-Rating",Back in November 2022 I wrote an  about Petrobras  discussing investors biggest concern with the company  political risk My thesis at the time was that while some changes like reduction in the dividend will happen the bearishThe longawaited changes in the dividend policy were announced at the end of July reducing the payout from 60 of FCF to 45 While this seems like 25 reduction in capital returned to shareholders the actual decrease will likely be lower as now management intends to include share repurchases in the mix as well The announced changes in shareholder remuneration policy while important on their own have considerably reduced uncertainty In accordance with the new plan Petrobras will pay approximately US3B in dividends from its Q223 FCF of US67BManagement has also commented on the buyback program which is expected to be aimed to the preferred shares One other common investors concern was that the new government and respectively management will move Petrobras away from its core business  fossil fuels rapidly However recent  from Joelson Mendes  the Chief Exploration and Production Officer of the company indicate that oil and gas will be produced by the Brazilian energy giant for at least 4 decades more The YoY increase in production which was reported in Q223 is another testament for that Overall I think that managements attitude towards the core business demonstrates that the fears of rapid transition away from fossil fuels are unsubstantiatedOne of the areas of interest of the company regarding exploration is the area of the Amazon river This move has caught opposition from the Ibama environmental agency which has  the project However the company appealed the decision and subsequently the attorney generals office  an opinion that an impact study isnt necessary potentially opening the door for exploration in the area The news was welcomed very positively by the market as shares of Petrobras  more than 66 despite the red day for oilAnother common concern amongst investors was the potential introduction of price controls which force the company to sell its products to the domestic market at deep discounts While indeed the domestic price policy has changed and their level is lower than those on international markets Petrobras recently  prices on diesel and gasoline to reflect the increase on international levels So it looks that while some discount will be maintained it will be in some range and will move in accordance with international levelsAll these recent announcements reduce substantially political risk  the main factor behind Petrobras deep discount to the other oil majors While the shares of the Brazilian company have recently appreciated the valuation gap with peers remains and should be further reduced given the decrease in uncertainty surrounding PetrobrasThe recent political and companylevel decisions regarding Petrobras decrease uncertainty driven by political risk substantially The company plans to stick with oil  gas production for the next four decades while the latest news from the AGs office could open the door for exploration in the Amazon area The updated shareholder returns policy still leaves the dividend yield well into doubledigit territory at current oil prices At the same time Petrobras remains the cheapest oil major by far which shouldnt be for long given the reduction of political risk   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,49,2023-08-24,5,0.969,-0.4285713673469475

86,86,Tesla Stock: AI Optimism Seems Overblown,I have been covering   stock here on Seeking Alpha since October 2021 and my conclusions have fluctuated between buy and sell coming to negative conclusions the last 4 times The data is piling up theFor example those who follow the company regularly know that analysts at Morgan Stanley  recently issued a report in which Adam Jonas et al upgraded the stock to Overweight and raised their price objective from 250 to 400 giving TSLA additional momentum in the marketThe main argument for the upgrade was the new Dojo system which analysts believe should add as much as 500 billionWell I invite you to take a look with me at the premises underlying the analysts assumptions and decide for yourself how close they seem to be to realityFirst off lets define Dojo It is a computer hardware and software system that is intended to process vast amounts of data and train AI algorithms quickly and efficiently helping Tesla improve the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full SelfDriving FSD systemsMorgan Stanley wrote Dojo could save Tesla around 65 billion by FY2024 but this is unverified because of the early stage of Dojos rollout MS admits The system could also accelerate the monetization of vehicle software leading to higher revenues Network Services could reach 335 billion by FY2040 representing a significant portion of Teslas earnings driven by fleet licensing and increased revenue per user The value of Dojo is also linked to Tesla Mobility robotaxis and the 3rd Party Battery BusinessIn many ways the estimates that influenced Morgan Stanleys upgrade came from the firms forecasts not from the banks own projectionsThe Morgan Stanley study repeatedly points out that Dojo is a relatively new technology that will take some time before we see how it works in practice Especially when it is applied to the companys widescaled operationsIn a meeting with Martin Viecha TSLAs VP IR another major investment bank  Goldman Sachs  concluded that the company still has a lot of work to do to make Dojo work proprietary source Moreover FSD on any vehicle seems a long way off at least for nowDuring the  Elon Musk mentioned that Tesla will be spending north of 1 billion on Dojos RD over the next year outlook includes all related expenses On a TTM basis its over 30 of Teslas overall RD to date which is a lot meaning a bunch of other research projects required for a primarily manufacturing company no matter what anyone saysIt seems to me that despite the really interesting prospects Tesla has thanks to its new Dojo Morgan Stanley is rushing things the real effect of the introduction of this technology is still far enough away to talk about how many billions it can add to the already high valuation of the companyLooking at how operating margins have behaved lately I think investors should look at Teslas core business and its conditions before jumping on the AI bandwagon after the MS recommendationHow have analysts changed their forecasts for the core parts of the companys business Well extremely positive or neutral as far as I can seeI dont know about you but to me increasing the EBITDA margin forecast against the backdrop of a gross margin decline looks like a rather illogical activity Adding to the instability of this forecast is an additional input of the exit EVEBITDA multiple expansion which I think makes MSs conclusion even more vulnerable to any possible downsidesTodays reality not a 10year forecast into the future is that Tesla is most actively lowering the prices of its cars assumingly trying to a protect their internal sales targets and b capture more of the global market shareBut something tells me TSLA wont stop with existing price cuts and incentives The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index has already begun to adjust downward due to declining inflation making used cars increasingly affordable and taking away automakers share of the overall de,433,2023-09-18,8,0.9871,-0.23076921301775286

88,88,Perseus Mining Is Well-Positioned To Take Off With Bullish Gold,This analysis suggests a Buy stance on Perseus Mining Limited  shares This company engages in the production of gold in West AfricaAnalysts at Trading Economics  the price of gold whichThere are several ways to take advantage of the next rise in gold prices One of these is direct investment in the yellow metal but generally this is not the most practical route for retail investors The retail investor can also take advantage of the price differentials that occur in the gold futures markets or he can invest in the equities of gold companies that are listed on the stock exchange The last solutionAmong the many publicly traded companies exploring and producing the precious metal retail investors should consider shares of the Australian gold producer Perseus Mining Limited PMNXFThe shares of this producer of gold from mines in countries of the West African region are likely to witness a strong upward trend with the expected increase in the price per ounce of gold as the companys assets are currently in a positive moment efficient mineral resource development allows production at the high end of the companys forecasts keeping costs under control and lower than many major competitors in the mining industryIn such a situation any increase in the price of gold will lead to an improvement in the gold margin per ounce which will strengthen the companys project to achieve further growth while respecting the needs of the local communities where it operatesWith macroeconomic conditions favoring an increase in the price of gold Perseus Mining Limited has excellent opportunities to further improve its profitability which should have a very positive impact on the market price of the stock The latter aspect is based on a strong positive correlation between Perseus Mining Limiteds PMNXF share price and the gold priceThe correlation between the share price PMNXF and the price of gold futures GCV2023  gold futures is the benchmark for the price of gold  is represented in the Seeking Alpha chart below by a solid yellow area above zeroBased on a linear model where the last 52 weekly returns of an investment in PMNXF stock represent the output and the last 52 weekly returns of an investment in gold futures represent the inputs it appears that the change in PMNXF stock price averages 28 times the change in the price of gold futuresAs just estimated this circumstance is very promising if gold enters a bull market as expected while the coefficient of determination R2 is around 45 indicating that gold price changes have a large influence on stock price determination Therefore if a prediction of the future development of the PMNXF stock price uses the results of this model it is more likely that the forecast is supported by a reliable assumptionThe past 52 weekly returns were considered rather than a broader range of returns as going forward the market is likely to be affected by most of the macroeconomic factors we have seen recently such as higher interest rates persistent inflation and geopolitical instability These factors play an important role in determining the price of goldAn improvement in the gold margin can also have a very positive effect on the share price If Perseus Mining Limited performs effectively the stock will rise in the analysts rankings and attract even more bullish sentiment that would otherwise be picked up by other stocksAs already described the outlook for the price of gold is rosyInstead taking into account the costs incurred by Perseus Mining Limited to produce and sell gold the allin site costs were 959oz for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 2023 and the company appears to be well ahead of many operators in the global mining industryThe benchmark is provided by SP Global Market Intelligence which in this  uses an allin sustaining cost metric AISCounce of 1289 per ounce of gold as of Q12023 as the average of a group of selected top gold minin,3,2023-09-16,1,0.9992,0.799999960000002

107,107,On Growing Federal Debt And Potential For Nuclear War,Famed money manager Paul Tudor Jones  on CNBC on Tuesday The wellknown billionaire investor who first made his bones predicting and profiting from theI agree with Mr Jones that investors should be much more concerned about the exploding national debt than they appear to be at the moment In addition his take on the new conflict and its potential to escalate sharply just adds to the myriad major geopolitical events investors have to keep a wary eye on right now We discuss both topics belowMr Jones stated This concern is one I share and is no stranger to my Seeking Alpha followers as I have highlighted this topic many times over the past few months Our nations debt situation gets way too little focus from our media as well in my opinionThe situation seems to be getting worse and not better on this front recently The federal government deficit for FY2023 that ended on September 30th is now  to come in at around 17 trillion And this when the country is seeing two percent GDP growth so far in 2023In addition the national debt has risen some 2 trillion just in the four months since the last debt ceiling raise The federal governmental debt  some 500 billion just from September 15th to October 5th it should also be notedThe cost to service the burgeoning national debt will continue to increase at current yields in the quarters and years ahead All one has to do is basic math The current blended interest rate on the just over 33 trillion in national debt is just over 29 The current yield on the TenYear Treasury is currently around 46 Some 30 of the national debt will roll over and need to be refinanced over the 12 months and just over half will need to do the same over the next three yearsAs I stated in my recent article  this is simply untenable on a longerterm basis I believe the Federal Reserves only option is to continue to increase rates until the economy goes into recession This will bring interest rates down significantly as inflation finally gets squelched and will lower the costs to service the national debt This is also something Mr Jones pointed out during his interview on CNBCIn addition even though the Fed Funds rate has been taken up by over 500bps since March of 2022 inflation is still not near to the central banks official two percent target We saw more evidence of this Wednesday morning when the September PPI  came in much hotter than expected Thursday morning the September CPI reading will post before the opening bell as wellThe other disconcerting thing the wellknown fund manager said was heI put the chances of this new conflict escalating to this point at extremely low but not out of the realm of possibilities Israel possesses tactical nukes and if Iran is drawn into an expanding conflict that country has the capabilities to build  and the to deliver those payloadsWe also have a proxy war still going on in Ukraine with Russia the country with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world that has now gone on for more than for a year and a half The biggest land war in Europe since WWII has already resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides While the conflict seems to have devolved into a bloody stalemate there is no telling how events on the ground will go in the coming months and quartersThen there is always the  of China invading Taiwan a concern that has been lingering for more than a year now In short there are more potential major geopolitical events than usual within the current environment for investors to worry aboutThis is on top of concerns about a deteriorating American  a potential commercial real  in 2024 the continuing struggle against  as well as the Leading Economic Indicators declining for 17 straight months now Something that hasnt occur since 200702008 right before the Great Financial CrisisDespite all these risks investors are being paid very little premium to hold stocks right now at current trading leve,180,2023-10-11,2,-0.9837,-0.8260869206049165

109,109,Energy Transfer: Strong Income Generator Amid Uncertain Times,I last wrote on Energy Transfer  a bit more than three months ago see the chart below The  argued for a buyFastforward to now the stock has indeed delivered strong returns against an overall market decline To wit the stock has enjoyed aDespite the price rally I see the stock as an even stronger buy at this point and consequently this article will upgrade my rating to Strong Buy In the remainder of this article I will elaborate on two of my key considerations for my upgraded rating First I will argue that a few new catalysts have happened since then and they can provide ET with a better growth potential Second because of such a better growth potential the stock valuation has actually become even more discounted from the Graham PEOil prices have recovered strongly since my last article As seen from the chart below Brent futures were in the 75 range at that time It has since then reached a peak of almost 100 and currently hovers around 87 Now I see a couple of catalysts to keep oil prices or energycommodity prices in general elevated and provide a tailwind for ET in the near futureThe most important catalyst in my view sadly is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas In general geopolitical risks tend to increase demand for oil and commodities for several reasons Geopolitical conflicts tend to disrupt supply transportation and global trading At the same time both the general public and investors may seek to store more commodities as a hedge against the ongoing geopolitical conflictsSpecific to the IsraelHamas conflict I see more immediate impacts on oil and energy prices The conflict could have nonlinear ramifications on other countries in the Middle Eastern region many of which are important oil productionexport countries Iran is the first specific example that came to my mind Iran is a significant oil production country and also a known supporter of Hamas As such its a possible scenario in my view we could see a tightening of restrictions on Iranian oil exportsAdmittedly these catalysts are relevant to the general energy sector and wont only serve as a tailwind for ET However I will argue that thanks to a few differentiating factors ET is better positioned to navigate the ramifications of such geopolitical events than the sector average The top differentiators are its scale and integrated operations ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America Its assets are highly integrated which allows it to achieve significant operational efficiencies For example its pipeline network connects production areas to processing facilities and storage terminals which allows the company to move products quickly and efficiently to marketThis unique strength has provided ET with the resilience to deliver strong results amid market turmoil The following chart shows its recent dividend payouts as a reflection of such resilience As seen the dividend amount has recovered very quickly since the COVID19 pandemic It increased rapidly from 0175 per share in the first quarter of 2022 to 031 per share at this point This represents an increase of approximately 77 and its current payout already is higher than its prepandemic level of 0305 per shareThe stock is currently yielding 906 on an FWD basis Such a high yield when combined with its resilience and discounted valuation argued next makes it a strong income generator in uncertain times like thisFor the valuation of a traditional business like ET I will follow the Graham approach as detailed in his book Intelligent Investor In particular I will start with the socalled Graham PE As detailed in my earlier articleIn ETs case consensus estimates project an EPS growth rate of 1 CAGR at the time of my original article The above projection was too pessimistic in my view But even with a 1 growth rate its Graham PE would be 105x At that time the stock w,37,2023-10-10,7,0.9838,-0.037037035665294975
110,110,My View Of Wall Street: A Disturbing Macro Scene,It is no secret that many of theSpeaking of a challenge the Fed has been left with a nearimpossible task They are trying to come up with a solution that measures the right amount of restraint needed to bring inflation back was once believed to be a temporary issue beginning in 2021 but the inflation rate defied those forecasts and climbed until reaching a peak in March 2022 The Fed says it is determined to get it back to the 20 mark but it does not   some four years after inflation began to move higher Weve already seen the effects Higher prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services  gasoline food shelter cars hotel room rates and restaurantsThese price increases arent going away anytime soon It would be foolish to believe we wont see this issue having an impact well into next year and perhaps well beyond that The Feds goal is 2 but getting inflation back down to the 20 mark is not good enough  to counter some of the cumulative buildup from the longlasting runup in inflation The Fed will surely stay on course higher for longer but they are once again stuck I doubt the Fed can loosen the reins even after inflation hits its target as they will have to wait until this runup in inflation is reversedInflation spares no one It erodes the consumers purchasing power Unfortunately the ones hurt the most are those at the lower end of the income scale and those relying on a fixed income They cannot easily avoid rising food and energy prices and higher rent which consume a very large portion of their takehome pay The warnings were there Excessive and as it turned out all of the added unnecessary spending to right an economy that was already right may remain a problem that can haunt the MACRO scene for a whileI do not agree with some market pundits assessments that the economy is less interest ratesensitive than it has been in the past Their claim is relatively speaking interest rates are not high when compared to history They have a point but that argument stops there Weve seen how equities  reacted to any movement in the 10year treasury note Its been the speed of these increases that kills their argument If that isnt enough after years of zero interest rates the market will t but this adjustment period will take time There is also another unknown that not many are talking about We have a large contingent of money managers and investors who have never been invested in a stock market where interest rates are moving higher How they are reacting and how they will act when rates dont come down tomorrow is yet to be determinedSo as a result I think it is premature to predict a soft nonrecessionary landing and all systems go for a rousing BULL market With multiple headwinds building on the horizon a recession is more likely How mild it is remains unanswered However if the Fed loses its patience or overstays its welcome some believe they already have the downturn could be more protracted than some of the forecasters expect Ill note that the forecasters referred to in the last statement have dwindled to a scant fewWhat drives the US economy is Consumer spending which makes up nearly 70 of the GDP With the strong labor market good wage improvements and all the pandemic stimulus they could ever want consumers have danced their way through the Feds aggressive rate hikes and higher borrowing costs However there are a few reasons why we can expect things to change For starters the labor market is softening Second excess savings from the pandemic are swindling so consumers no longer have a cushion to support their spending Third with student loan payments set to resume on October 1 likely to subtract 04 from consumer spending in 24 and gas prices rising as oil prices move higher from 68bbl to 90bbl consumers should have less discretionary income to spend going forward There is a positive they do have a job and as l,262,2023-10-14,3,-0.955,-0.4999999791666675

116,116,"Sentiment Speaks: Do You Care About Gold? Well, You Should",This is now my second article on metals in the last week And the main reason I have chosen to write recently is because there are just too many fallacies presented in the many otherIn my last article I addressed the manipulation and inflation fallacies regarding gold in addition to the confirmation bias which seems to be prevalent in the comments section all too frequently In this weeks article I am going to address the safe haven fallacy the inverseinflation argument as well as the fallacy regarding the US DollarLets start with the safe haven fallacyThe last time we saw the occurrence of a major geopolitical event was when Russia invaded Ukraine Yet goldHow can we explain this based upon the safe haven perspective Did Russia suddenly pull out from Ukraine Or can we more reasonably assume that there really is no safe haven driver of gold I know where I stand based upon the facts of history In fact you can see the same in just about every geopolitical occurrence through the years Gold has not diverted from the pattern that it was trading within before the eventMoreover major rallies begun in the metals market have not been triggered by geopolitical events Just ask yourself if were there any geopolitical events which started the rally we saw in 2016 in the metals market That rally took almost everyone by surprise as most were extremely bearish of the metals at that time Well almost everyoneOn December 30 2015 I penned the following message to those willing to listenBut I digressSo please spare me with the fallacies of gold being a safe haven during geopolitical events History proves that this is not what drives gold So any articles that present an underlying premise based upon the safe haven argument should be summarily dismissed for lack of historical support or understanding of what drives goldWhat astounded me even more was an article reasoning that we should wait for inflation to dissipate before gold will rally It seems that there are people that are surmising that since gold did not rally due to inflation then it must mean that it will rally when inflation subsides And yes I just shook my headFolks for as long as I have been investing in gold many decades there have been arguments proffered that gold rallies during inflation and an equal number of arguments that it rallies during deflation And you know what history proves Both arguments are wrong If you look at historical periods of inflation you will see there are times that gold will rally and there are times that gold will fall And if you look at historical periods of deflation you will see there are times that gold will rally and there are times gold will fallSo what conclusion should you derive from any arguments focused upon inflation or deflation You should ignore them because anyone that relies upon those drivers has no clue about how metals work nor have they bothered to review the lessons of historyLastly I have seen many arguments that claim that gold does not rally when the dollar is strong And because the dollar is strong right now then gold will not rally There are two main issues with this argumentFirst I am not going to provide to you a dissertation regarding the many historical periods of time where gold rallied alongside the dollar or dropped alongside the dollar If you take the time to look you will find it on your own But I will simply point out that the DXY Dollar Index is now just below its 20 year highs and so is goldSecond the crux of argument is based upon a linear expectation that the dollar will remain in the trend in which it currently is traveling But is that how markets work Are markets really that linear And between you and me I am seeing the DXY approaching a topping point and will likely begin to drop towards the 96 regionNow that we have addressed further fallacies in the metals market I will explain to you why you should care about the metals m,5,2023-10-20,8,0.6021,-0.7647058373702448
117,117,Depression Alert: Why The Shrinking Money Supply Spells Trouble For SPY,The US economy is currently experiencing a rare event that hasnt been witnessed since 1949 a shrinking money supply M2 has declined by a whopping 700 billion since the hiking cycle began This phenomenon is In this article we will explore why the US money supply is shrinking and delve into its potentially negative implications for SPY and the broader financial landscapeThe recent contraction in the US money supply is not solely due to a single isolated cause Rather it is a result of a complex interplay of factors that have evolved over time including changes in Federal Reserve policy rising interest rates financial innovations and shifts in market dynamicsWe will discuss the three most prominent of these factors below One significant contributor to the shrinking money supply is the change in Federal Reserve policy away from quantitative easing and towards quantitative tightening The Fed has been reducing its massive 8 trillion balance sheet so far to the tune of 800 billion which in turn has had a direct impact on savings deposits because as the Fed rolls off assets like Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities as they reach maturity it reduces the money supply since these assets instead need to be financed by bank deposits or other forms of money Additionally rising interest rates  which have pushed yields higher in numerous financial products such as money markets  have discouraged individuals and institutions from keeping their funds in lowyield savings and checking accounts leading to a decline in deposits Moreover the continued growth in credit and debit card adoption by consumers has reduced the reliance on physical cash for everyday transactions while the years of ultralow interest rates the growing digitization of financial markets and the rise of userfriendly commissionfree trading apps like Robinhood  have made it easier and more attractive for households to allocate their savings to investments rather than traditional bank deposits Yes interest rates have risen recently but many individuals have already been activated as investors and have formed the habit of allocating excess savings to stocks rather than to a bank savings accountThese three major factors have led to a staggering 24 trillion decline in savings deposits since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in early 2022So what does the shrinking US money supply mean for SPY The reality is quite nuancedOne of the most accurate ways of measuring the relationship between the money supply and SPY performance is its impact on interest rates though the relationship between interest rates and stock market performance is complex Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixedincome assets more attractive relative to stocks As investors seek higher yields in bonds there might be a shift away from equities like those in SPY thereby hurting its performance We have seen this dynamic at play recently as surging bond yields have weighed on SPYs performanceConversely when interest rates are very low investors seeking returns are inclined to invest in riskier assets like stocks driving their prices higher due to increased demand This was one of the main reasons why SPY boomed over the decade between 2012 and 2021 especially in the aftermath of the COVID19 outbreakAnother reason why interest rates have an impact on SPY is that  when market interest rates rise  it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money for profitable projects leading to higher interest payments and lower profits In some cases projects may become unfeasible Lower profits translate to lower stock prices because stock prices are a reflection of a companys future earnings Conversely when interest rates fall companies can borrow more easily boosting profits and economic growth A classic recent example of this was seen at NextEra Energy Partners  where management just  its target growth rate in ha,55,2023-10-10,1,0.9983,-0.23809522675737013

124,124,Gold Rebounding Again,By Brien LundinGold is taking off to the upside again as investors rush to the supposed safe haven of the yellow metal and the speculators quickly cover their short betsSometimes a good day for gold isTheres no good reason why anyone should buy gold when violence breaks out somewhere in the world even when the event is as horrendous and ripe for escalation as the Hamas attack on IsraelThe reason to own gold is because you believe the purchasing power of your currency is going to dive even more steeply and that prospect simply doesnt apply in this caseSo a gold rally in the wake of a geopolitical event is usually something to be avoidedI want to explore howEarly last year as the Fed was readying for the initial rate hike in its campaign to stymie growing inflationary pressures gold started to rallyGold often in fact  rises during Fed rate hikes That seems counterintuitive but the record is clear on thisFor example during golds legendary bull run of the 1970s gold continued to rise because inflation was rising more quickly than the Fed could raise rates Finally Volcker was able to kill off inflation by drastically hiking rates above 20Now back to early last yearAs you can see from the chart below gold began to rise in January of last year as Fed rhetoric started to point toward an imminent rate hike campaign Notably the gold price ran for at least a couple of weeks before the potential of a Russian invasion emergedNote that after the gold price had risen for about a month Russia actually did invade and this briefly turbocharged the gold rallyThen after World War III failed to emerge the crisis moved from the front page and as usual the gold price declined after the initial panic subsidedIn effect this geopolitical crisis overwhelmed the drivers that were already in play And the price downtrend it created as the initial fears passed led to an extenuated bear market as the Fed relentlessly raised rates over the next 18 monthsFast forward to today and we see that gold was dramatically oversold as the crisis in Israel unfolded and in fact seemed to have bottomed on Friday the day before the attack beganYes there is the risk that the gold price will fall if and when the tensions in the Mideast subside or there is some resolution after Israel invades GazaBut were in a much different macroeconomic environment today as compared against early 2022Today the US economy is straining under the burden of what may be the harshest tightening cycle ever enacted by the Fed Bankruptcies are surging and the lagging effects of the rate hikes are yet to be feltEven before the violence erupted this rate hike cycle had essentially peaked So whenever these troubles begin to fade away we will either be in or approaching the downside of the cycleThese forces will be far too powerful for the easing of geopolitical tensions to overcome This rally will not be killed off The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,4,2023-10-11,2,-0.9971,-0.7499999687500013

134,134,Attacks On Israel Introduce Tail-Risks To Oil Prices,At the outset our thoughts and sympathies go out to those affected by the shocking attacks in IsraelThis past weekend we witnessed a severe escalationBefore these developments the ongoing talks around normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel were a key market focus given their potential implications for oil production Saudi Arabia had reportedly expressed a willingness to boost oil production if crude prices remained high This was part of a complex deal brokered by the US that aimed for Saudi Arabias recognition of Israel and a commitment to increased production The talks were under close scrutiny by investors asHowever the recent attacks have dramatically shifted these dynamics The escalating conflict has likely decreased the chances of nearterm normalization in SaudiIsraeli relations This could potentially affect Saudi oil production plans leading them to extend their existing cuts for a longer period which could further deplete already low global oil inventoriesAnother significant player in the global energy market Iran is also expected to see a major shift in US policy Before the attacks the US had adopted a softer posture toward Iran allowing it to approach pre2018 levels of oil production However given recent events and Irans known support for Hamas the US may adopt a stricter stance potentially leading to a reduction in the Iranian oil supplyThese developments underscore the real and potentially harmful risks presented by geopolitical uncertainties Persistently high oil prices could drive inflation affecting both stocks and bonds In these uncertain times assets sensitive to geopolitical events could serve as a potential hedge In particular we believe the energy sector which is intrinsically linked to geopolitics may offer an opportunityThat said the implications of recent events are only beginning to emerge and we will watch closely in the coming weeks for signs of potential direction and impact for commodities and the broader financial markets and economy 20092023 Neuberger Berman Group LLC All rights reserved ,4,2023-10-03,2,-0.8126,-0.39999996000000404
135,135,What Do The Markets Believe About The War?,We arent geopolitical experts and do not know howAt the time of the Hamas attack on Israel the oil market was slightly oversold due to a price plunge over the preceding week Consequently at least a countertrend rebound was likely regardless of newsDuring the three trading days after the war news hit the wires 9th11th October the oil price bounced and then pulled back We wrote in the 11th October Interim Update that this price action suggested an expectation among large oil traders that the conflict would not broaden or that if it did broaden then Saudi Arabia would act to offset any loss of oil from IranThe subsequent price action indicates that the oil market has not changed its mind We say this because the rebound in the oil price from its prewarnews low looks more like a countertrend reaction than the start of a move to above the September2023 high Also the extent of the backwardation in the oil futures market has decreased over the past week which suggests less urgency to stockup on physical oilIn summary the oil market does not believe that the war will have a significant negative effect on global oil supplyPrior to the war news hitting the wires the gold market was very oversold in both momentum and sentiment terms and therefore was poised for a rebound As a result of the war news the rebound has been much stronger than it otherwise would have beenThe performance of the US gold price indicates that large speculators initially were uncertain as to how big the war would become Would it be confined to Israel versus Hamas inaround Gaza or would it expand to encompass direct involvement from the US and Iran Also how much additional US government spending would result from the war in the Middle East and how would this spending affect the resources directed towards the NATORussia war in UkraineAt the moment large speculators in the gold market believe that these are open questions with a substantial expansion of the war being one of the more likely scenarios Thats a reasonable conclusion because the gold price continues to hover around resistance at US19802000  about 180 above where it was three weeks agoWell know that the perceived level of uncertaintyrisk has increased significantly if the gold price breaks above US2000 By the same token well know that the perceived level of uncertaintyrisk has begun to wane when there is a clear downward reversal in the US gold price Note that a downward reversal in the US gold price is likely to precede a turn for the better in the news from the Middle EastIn the US stock market the war has prompted a shift away from risk but has been very much a secondary issue The primary issue is the downward trend in the bond market the upward trend in longdated Treasury yieldsIn earlyOctober the Dollar Index  was very overbought and had just begun to correct The war news may have reduced the magnitude of the correction but up until now has not been sufficient to propel the DX above its earlyOctober highAs far as we can tell according to the currency market the outbreak of war in the Middle East has increased the attractiveness of the US relative to other fiat currencies but also added to concerns about the pace at which the US government is going into debt Putting it another way whats priced into the currency market at the moment is both the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the war and the offsetting consideration that the war is increasing the risk of a US government debt spiralSummarising all of the above the oil market is not concerned about a significant supply disruption the gold market has pricedin considerable uncertaintyrisk and could pricein more of the same before reversing the US stock market is more concerned about bond yields than about the Middle East and the currency market thinks that the benefits of holding the US in a period of increasing geopolitical instability are being mostly offset by the like,2,2023-10-10,2,-0.9934,-0.39130433081285515

137,137,Amgen's Acquisition Of Horizon Means The Stock Is A Buy,In my previous  on Amgen  explaining the market outlook for the companys products its developments and its performance I said that the stock is a buy Since my previous article on the stock AMGNs stock priceHorizon Therapeutics revenue for the twelve months ending 30 June 2023  36 billion and its revenue for the full year 2022 was also 36 billion Also for the twelve months ending 30 June 2023 Horizon Therapeutics had an operating income of 513 million and for the full year 2022 Horizon had a net income of 617 million As I mentioned previously Amgen acquired Horizon at an equity value of 278 billion As a result of the acquisition of Horizon Amgens inflammation portfolio is now stronger due to medicines such as TEPEZZA KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA which treat rare inflammatory diseases Also Amgens international footprint has now widened and the company is in a better position to conduct further research and development Based on Horizons previous financial results and Amgens current operating results I estimate this acquisition can increase Amgens annual revenue by 12 to 14As of October 9 2023 Amgen had an equity value of about 143 billion Thus we can say that Amgen has an equity value to annual revenue of 53x and based on Horizons revenue potential and the cash that Amgen paid to acquire it Horizons equity value to revenue can be calculated to be about 79x It simply means that Amgen valued each dollar of revenue that Horizon can make at 79 while investors are valuing each dollar of revenue that Amgen can make excluding the effect of the acquisition at 53 Also I calculated Amgen and Horizons before being acquired by Amgen equity value to operating income to be 149x and 463x It simply means that Amgen valued each dollar of operating income that Horizon can make at 463 while investors are valuing each dollar of operating income that Amgen can make at 149 Finally I calculated Horizons equity value to total liabilities and equity value to total assets to be 69x and 30x It means that Amgen valued each dollar of Horizons total liabilities and total assets at 69 and 30 respectively On the other hand investors are valuing each dollar of Amgens total liabilities and total assets at 18 and 16 respectively From my perspective it is not rational to think that Amgens management overvalued Horizon Therapeutics this much Thus I can count on one of these two scenarios Amgen is undervalued by investors or due to the acquisition of Horizon Amgens financial results and metrics in the future can improve in a significant way Either way the result is that I believe Amgen is undervalued at its current pricesRegardless of the positive effects of the acquisition of Horizon you should know that compared to six months ago Amgen is in a stronger position In my previous article I explained that due to the inclusion of Repatha on Chinas National Reimbursement Drug List as of 1 January 2022 Amgens Repatha sales can increase In the first quarter of 2023 Amgen revenue of 388 million from Repatha which  to 424 million in 2Q 2023 and can increase further driven by higher sales volume Also I explained that due to increased competition Amgens Enbrel and XGEVA sales might decrease In the first quarter of 2023 Enbrel sales were significantly lower than in 4Q 2022 however increased again in 2Q 2023 driven by a higher net selling price Enbrel sales in 3Q 2023 and 4Q 2023 can be higher than in 2Q 2023 as better insurance coverage may lead to a higher number of patients Also contrary to the expectations XGEVA sales in 1Q 2023 were higher than in 4Q 2022 meaning that the negative effects of higher competition on Amgens XGEVA sales were not significant The companys XGEVA sales increased further in 2Q 2023 and due to a higher net selling price Amgens XGEVA sales in 2H 2023 can be higher than in 1H 2023Overall in the second quarter of 202,5,2023-10-19,3,0.9938,0.33333329629630043

141,141,The Most Important Inflation Metric Is Back At Target Levels: SPY Implications,The The rise of AI earlier this year boosted the technology megacap stocks  Microsoft Corp  Apple Inc  Amazoncom Inc As a result SPY got off to a roaring start to the yearSince then however longterm interest rates have soared higher geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have increased significantly and the assumption that interest rates will remain higher for longer has taken hold on Wall Street Moreover some of the aforementioned megacap tech stocks have posted Q3 results that disappointed Wall Street further weighing on SPY SPY is also likely suffering from the fact that it is trading at an elevated valuation andThat being said some good news came out today with the single most important inflation metric signaling that we are basically back to the Federal Reserves longterm target level In this article we will look at the specifics of this more and discuss its implications for SPYToday  that in September inflation remained stable without any significant cooling or resurgence as reported by the US Department of Commerce The September Core PCE Price Index the Federal Reserves main inflation measure rose 37 YY which was similar to the consensus estimate and slightly down from Augusts 38On a monthtomonth basis core PCE which omits energy and food prices due to their volatility and sensitivity to shortterm factors like weather and geopolitical events rose 03 Furthermore the overall PCE Price Index increased 04 MM while on a YY basis it grew 34The best news of all is that  on a threemonth annualized pace  core PCE has slowed to 24 If the Federal Reserves target inflation rate is 2 that means that inflation is nearly back to normal levels that we last saw in 2020RSM US Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas seconded this notion when he statedBesides being the Feds favorite inflation metric the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures index is often cited as the best predictor of longterm inflation for the following reasonsAnother piece of excellent news for inflations outlook was that consumer spending  which is largely credited with being the main force keeping inflation sticky  surpassed personal income Personal income increased by 03 MM while spending rose by 07 pushing the personal saving rate down to 34 its lowest level of the year As a result inflation is likely going to subside at an accelerated pace in the coming months as consumer spending is on an unsustainable pace and the saving rate is reaching low levels As Morning Consults senior economist Kayla Bruun commentedWith interest rates soaring and credit card debt at  it is highly unlikely that the consumer is going to be able to rely much more on debt to sustain its shopping spree moving forward As a result we think the conclusion is inevitable that we are on the threshold of inflation falling meaningfully With Core PCE already nearly at the Federal Reserves longterm target a decline in consumer spending will likely push us below 2 enabling the Federal Reserve to not only pause but likely begin to pivot towards cutting interest ratesDeclining inflation and falling interest rates would  for the stock market and SPY would be no exception That being said we also need to bear in mind that falling consumer spending would likely mean that a recession hits the economy as well which will weigh on some of the less defensive names in the index including megacaps that are more consumerfacing such as AAPL TSLA and AMZN After all recent yield curve behavior implies that a recession is highly likely as when the spread between the 10 Year treasury yield and the 3 Month treasury yield becomes negative yield curve inversion it has historically been a precursor to recessions as seen by the Inversion Points in the chart belowMoreover SPY is clearly overvalued based on several valuation metrics includingAs a result while falling inflation and interest rates could,32,2023-09-26,2,0.9383,-0.1666666597222225

147,147,Major Middle East Conflicts And The Stock Market: What History Teaches,To start the article with the most important message let me say that I am deeply troubled by the human tragedy caused by the Hamas Israel conflict Accordingly the movements of financial markets and the analysis of stock prices are of relatively minor significance comparedNevertheless my focus on writing for Seeking Alpha continued to anchor on financial commentary And following the events of what is happening in the Middle East I aim to provide investors with a reference analysis of how conflicts in the Middle East have historically impacted global markets  specifically stocks In that context I provide insights on how the SP 500  performed surrounding the key events 1 SixDay War ofConflicts in the Middle East can impact the SP 500 and global financial markets in several ways Firstly the Middle East is a major source of global oil production and any instability in the region can disrupt oil supplies leading to price spikes And as investors certainly know and understand higher oil prices can increase production costs for many SP 500 companies which affects their profitabilityRelating to being a key geography for oil supply and trade the Middle East plays also a crucial role in international trade For example the Suez Canal Egypt is one of the worlds most vital waterways connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea thus being of major importance for economies in Europe and Asia Similarly the Strait of Hormuz IranOman is arguably the worlds most important chokepoint for global oil trade with  of oil passing through the Strait every day about 20 of global demand In addition in the Middle East there are also many important global trade hubs for goods including the Port of Jebel Ali United Arab Emirates Port of Jeddah Saudi Arabia Port of Haifa Israel Doha Port Qatar and the Chabahar Port IranSo far the Hamas Israel conflict has not impacted the SP 500 much But markets are not entirely out of the woods yet Specifically investors should consider that conflicts in the Middle East have the potential to send tremors through the global political landscape with secondorder consequences affecting evolvement not only from key countries in the Middle East most notably Iran but also international countries with an interest in oil supply and political defensesupport agreements such as the US and ChinaPersonally I see two main scenarios that investors should watch to assess the impact of the war on markets In the first scenario the conflict remains confined to Gaza and Israel thus not affecting oil prices and the global economy much In the second scenario however the conflict spills over to neighboring countries like Lebanon and Syria perhaps also turning into a proxy war between Israel and Iran Such an outcome may easily disrupt global oil markets with Bloomberg Economics estimating that oil prices  to above 150 a barrel clearly bringing the potential to tip an already weakened global economy into a recessionWith that frame of reference it is worth noting that by Friday 13 October the price of oil Brent benchmark surged to its highest point since the onset of the IsraelHamas conflict surpassing 90 per barrel The US marker West Texas Intermediate also increased notably by 59 to 8769 per barrelNow lets see what history teachesLets start with the most notable direct example of a conflict involving Israel the SixDay War of 1967 Jun 5 1967  Jun 10 1967 The event in question was a brief but highly consequential conflict between Israel and several neighboring Arab states including Egypt Jordan and Syria resulting in a crushing victory for Israel While a significant geopolitical event the SixDay War did not have a notable or sustained impact on the SP 500 In fact as highlighted in the chart below the start of the war only led to a shortlived 510 selloff in the SP 500 which the index quickly recovered continuin,1,2023-10-16,2,-0.9862,-0.6363636074380178
148,148,The Art Of Hedging For A Market Meltdown: 5 Strategies (Ranked),Financial markets are never immune to turbulence and history has shown that market meltdowns though unpredictable are a recurring part of the investment landscape Whether triggered by economic downturns geopolitical events or unforeseen crises market meltdowns can wreak havoc on portfoliosIn this article we explore the art of positioning for a market meltdown Well delve into a range of strategies and assets that historically have shown resilience during downturns helpingThe first hedging idea that I want to discuss is also the most obvious Buying put options on the SP 500  For those who are not familiar with puts and options put options are financial contracts that give investors for a relatively small fee premium the right but not the obligation to sell a specific asset such as a stock at a predetermined price before or at a specified future date This means that as the SP 500 falls the value of the long puts rises effectively providing insurance against losses in the portfolio Accordingly these options contracts provide investors with the ability to profit from a decline in the SP 500 index giving investors exposure to a direct inverse correlation to the performance of the broad marketWhat is so great about options as a hedge in my opinion is that buying puts gives investors the opportunity to cap downside as limited by the maximum loss equal to the options premia outlay Moreover puts also allow investors to achieve significant and tailored exposure to the markets downside with a relatively small upfront investment This implied leverage can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the hedge basically allowing investors to insure their portfolio for 180240 days at a 25 implied interest on the portfolio with costs dependent on implied volatility interest rate dividend payments strike and time to expiration By selecting different strike prices and expiration dates long puts offer flexibility in designing a hedge that aligns with individual objectives and expectations regarding the markets performance Scenarios can be simulated here  on the Finally options on major indices such as the SP 500 are highly liquid and accessible through all major brokerage platformsThe price of an option depends on market volatility Higher volatility raises the price This is bad for the put options strategy discussed in the previous argument as times of market uncertainty usually come with elevated implied volatility levels on options thus making the Strategy somewhat expensive for investors An opportunity to avoid paying high premia to hedge the portfolio and actually take advantage of the high implied volatility during times of market stress relates to call overwrite strategies such as pursued by the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF To give readers a better understanding of  I point out that JEPI generates income by leveraging a combination of options selling and investments in US largecap stocks Its primary objective is to provide investors with a consistent monthly income flow derived from the premiums earned through option sales and dividends from the stock holdings To achieve this JEPI creates a welldiversified equity portfolio with a focus on minimizing volatility mostly dividend stocks and complements the equity holdings with short call options on the SP 500By selling call options JEPI agrees to sell its underlying assets at a predetermined strike price if the options are exercised In ideal cases the call options sold may not be exercised by the buyers allowing investors to retain ownership of the underlying assets and continue to retain the benefit from any future appreciation in the assets value Now while the call writing may also cap an investors upside potential it also establishes a level of protection though the options premium which can be especially valuable during market meltdowns and this article is all about downside as the premi,2,2023-10-18,1,0.9944,-0.35714284438775556

153,153,What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,First and foremost the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination This article is not about politics and it will not focus on whats right or wrong Instead we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent as of this writing are up 3 with WTI  trading above 85 and Brent above 87 Initially at the close of Friday WSJ published a report noting that the US is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high Soon after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel If you want to thoroughly review the events Some of you may wonder what does this have to do with oil Historically speaking geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions In this case Israel is not a major oil producer so whats the catch The catch in our view has to do with Irans potential involvement in this whole ordeal WSJ published a piece noting that Irans senior officials helped plan this attack months agoWhile the US has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on IranFor starters we need context to what we are writing In June  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market Since then IEA has confirmed via its figures that Irans oil production is close to 31 million bd Our supply  demand model assumes 33 million bd and official Iranian figures support that production is around 33 million bdPutting all of this together Iran is exporting close to 2 million bd Visible tanker exports account for 15 to 16 million bd while shadow exports account for 400k bdSince H2 2022 the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports As we wrote earlier in the year this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storageWith floating storage gone and crude exports back to 2 million bd 500 to 800k bd below the previous peak whats the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward Perhaps the US does nothing and leaves Iran as is but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view while the risk of a major loss is low we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months We think the average would fall from 2 million bd to 16 million bd In terms of visible tankers this means Irans crude exports would drop closer to 12 million bdWhile it wont be much of a decline it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into yearend and possibly well into H1 2024Looking at our latest supply  demand update we made a few important assumption changesIn essence global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by monthend And if the US starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports then our balance could surprise to the upside But with a deficit of 22 million bd the lack of production decline from Iran wont make that much of a difference eitherOn the other hand with no mega deal on the horizon between Israel and Saudi the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis wont be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least 110bbl With Brent trading at 87 we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a realityIn conclusion global oil inventories should accelerate downward But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession Fund flows will ebb and flow so oil prices wont skyrocket anytime soon Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception Until then we see prices grinding higher with frequent ,13,2023-09-29,2,-0.9951,-0.8571427959183717

161,161,Cross-Asset Tactical Opportunities In A Cycle-Ending Recession,The major force driving the financial markets over the foreseeable future will be the unfolding trend of deglobalization Specifically we are in a process of the fragmenting the global economy into the two blocks the firstInflation is likely to be higher Specifically 1 there will be more frequent spikes in oil and other commodities due to the likely geopolitical events 2 the cost of goods will likely be higher due to the trade barriers and the higher cost of production due to reshoring and onshoring production from China and 3 there will likely be a chronic shortage of labor due to onshoring but also due demographic trends  aging population which is likely to keep the wage growth elevated and thus the service inflation stickyGrowth will likely be slower as the global markets shrink for some goods resulting in less trade  less exports Corporate sales are likely to decrease as the global markets become more restrictive for some productsThus the financial markets are likely to be more volatile and more cyclical  with the more frequent recessions Specifically the central banks will likely be forced to respond to more frequent inflationary episodes and given the slow growth expectations this will likely cause a more frequent recessions  the business cycle will be shorter This is in contrast with the goldilocks over the last 40 years where we had low inflation and robust growth with only 3 recessions in 1991 2000 and 2008 excluding the Covid19 related 2020 recessionThus long term buyandhold investing is not going to be appropriate in the foreseeable future  investors will have to be more tactical forced to play the cycleCurrently we are in a monetary tightening cycle The Fed has been tightening monetary policy since March 2022 to respond to the postpandemic inflationary shock by increasing the interest rates and reducing the balance sheet The inflationary shock has been initially caused by the postpandemic supplychain disruptions and broader supplydemand imbalances However the current inflationary forces are more related to the unfolding trend of deglobalizationFor example 1 the price of oil has been recently rising due to the supply cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia both in the Chinas BRICS block 2 the current labor shortage is partially caused by strong labor demand due to onshoring and 3 the trade barriers heavily concentrated in the hightech sectors like semiconductors are increasing the costs of some goods like autosSo the key question is where we in the current cycle are The Fed has indicated that we are near the end of the interest rate hiking cycle with 1 more possible rate hike in 2023 although the QT is expected to continue Further the Fed expects to start modestly cutting interest rates in 2024 by 50bpt as inflation falls to 25 but keeping the real rates elevated  due to what appears to be expectations of sticky inflation Specifically the Fed acknowledges that the labor shortage will persist by estimating the full employment or a 41 unemployment rate until 2026 which will likely keep the service inflation elevatedThe Fed does not explicitly expect a recession in the SEP dotplot but Powell has indicated that soft landing is not the baseline scenario However the yield curve has been inverted since October 2022  and thus based on the historical evidence a recession is likely imminent which infact ends the monetary policy tightening cycleThe yield curve has been deeply inverted for a long time by historical standards which suggests a very deep recession  a hard landing However the recession has been delayed due to 1 strong consumer spending supported with the pandemicrelated excess savings and general postpandemic pentup demand for travel and entertainment and 2 fiscal spending particularly on manufacturing construction Note the wealth effect is also still very strong due to the still inflated housing prices and the overv,11,2023-09-20,2,0.9876,-0.7931034209274682

165,165,NACCO Industries: Cheap Valuation But Beware Of The Risks,NACCO Industries  passes under the radar of the vast majority of investors who prefer to avoid exposure to the industry of coal which is characterized by a secular decline over the long run However the stock has shed 38 inNACCO Industries is the largest producer of coal in the US and one of the top 10 coal producers in the world with a history of more than 110 years It produces coal from mines in North Dakota Texas Mississippi Louisiana and New Mexico and sells its output to power generation companies via multiyear contracts Each mineNACCO Industries has greatly benefited from the war in Ukraine Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine the US and the European Union imposed strict sanctions on the exports of oil and natural gas of Russia Consequently the prices of oil and natural gas skyrocketed last year to 13year highs Due to the insufficient global supply of natural gas the global use of coal surged and thus the price of coal  to a 15year high last yearNACCO Industries  of operating with a feebased model which somewhat protects the company from the wide fluctuations of the price of coal However the company has enjoyed a double tailwind thanks to the sanctions of western countries on Russia an increased demand for coal and much higher prices As a result NACCO Industries grew its earnings per share  last year from 669 in 2021 to an alltime high of 1006 in 2022However the global energy market has almost fully absorbed the effect of the Ukrainian crisis this year partly thanks to an abnormally warm winter in the beginning of the year As a result the price of coal has plunged 68 off its peak of 431 in 2022 to 138 now The current price is still much higher than the normal range 60100 before the Ukrainian crisis but the steep decrease of the price signals that there may be more downside aheadThe latest  of NACCO Industries was certainly much worse than the reports in the preceding quarters In the second quarter the company saw its earnings per share plunge 93 over the prior years quarter from 507 to 034 In addition management stated that the earnings in the second half of 2023 and the full year are expected to decrease significantly over the prior years levels Given this guidance and the 83 plunge of the earnings per share in the first half of the year it is safe to expect the earnings per share to slump by at least 70 in the full year To be sure the company has posted earnings per share of 109 in the first half of the year and hence it is unlikely to post earnings per share above 300 in the full year given the current business momentumGoing forward it is essentially impossible to forecast the earnings of NACCO Industries in the upcoming years given the pronounced sensitivity of the company to the demand for coal the sensitivity to the cycles of the price of coal and the unpredictable pace of the global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources more on this below It is also important to note that the stock is not covered by any analystIf one insists on forecasting the future earnings of NACCO Industries one should note that the company posted 10year low earnings per share of 210 in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic 10year high earnings per share of 669 in 2021 thanks to pentup demand after the pandemic and record earnings per share of 1006 in 2022 thanks to the aforementioned sanctions Therefore the period 20172019 is the most recent period with normal business conditions for the coal industry During that 3year period NACCO Industries posted average earnings per share of 493 Going forward and given the headwind from the ongoing energy transition NACCO Industries is not likely to achieve sustainable earnings per share above 493The coal industry is in a secular decline as most countries including the US are doing their best to shift from fossil fuels to clean energy sources This is clearly refle,0,2023-10-24,1,0.9961,-0.2857142653061239

179,179,Billionaire Ray Dalio Says '50% Chance Of World War' - How To Invest?,Billionaire Hedge Fund tycoon Ray Dalio  in a recent LinkedIn  titled Another Step Toward International War  offered some sobering takeaways from the escalating geopolitical conflicts involving Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine Dalio underscored that these are notIn this article we will look further at his reasoning behind this stark assertion evaluate the potential damage that such a conflict would cause to the global economy and share how weMr Dalios thesis draws on parallels between the current geopolitical climate and the periods preceding the two World Wars in the 20th century He emphasizes that the IsraelHamas and RussiaUkraine conflicts have transitioned from prehotwar conflicts to uncontained hot wars which will likely be brutal and protracted until one side decisively triumphs over the other Furthermore Dalio warns that these conflicts have the potential to spread and escalate involving more countries and potentially leading to a world war if major powers like the US and China are drawn into direct conflict with each otherHe believes that the conflicts involving Israel Hamas Ukraine and Russia are  just like in the periods preceding the past two world wars  symptomatic of larger great power conflicts that will significantly impact countries allied with these nations He suggests that the US is already indirectly engaged in these conflicts fighting proxy wars in Europe and the Middle East while also preparing for potential conflict in East Asia The spreading of these wars will not only be costly but will also risk drawing noncombatant nations into the fray thereby expanding the scope and scale of the conflictsIn terms of solutions Dalios idealistic pipe dream would be for world leaders to recognize the catastrophic potential of hot wars and collaboratively establish pathways and processes to minimize the chances of such conflicts developing Apart from that increasingly unlikely solution materializing however it appears to be only a matter of time before hot conflict between the worlds major military and economic powers breaks outFor stock market investors the implications of a global war would likely be devastating The escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the potential for them to spiral into a larger more widespread war could introduce significant volatility and risk into global marketsWhile the death and destruction that such a global conflict would cause are reason enough to shudder at the idea that they are growing increasingly likely the economic fallout would be catastrophic as well given how interconnected the global economy has become A war pitting China against the United States and undoubtedly involving Taiwan as well is anticipated to unleash severe repercussions on the global economy and some  put the damage at a 5 contraction of the 23 trillion US economy marking the worst decline since the Great Depression The stock markets in the US and around the world would undoubtedly crash likely surpassing even the 50 drop in the SP 500  and Nasdaq  witnessed during the 20072009 Great Financial Crisis and recession If the market capitalization of the SP 500 were to be halved it would wipe out around 18 trillion in wealth which is equivalent to roughly twothirds of the United States current GDP Some  even put a 10 GDP decline as probable in this scenario which equates to a 25 trillion hit to annual economic output triggering mass layoffs and plummeting consumption ratesOf course a significant casualty in this conflict that would drive much of the global economic chaos in its wake would be the semiconductor industry given that Taiwan is a critical player in global semiconductor production  A major disruption of Taiwans semiconductor exports to the worlds major economies is estimated to potentially eliminate 16 trillion in corporate annual revenue Moreover the supply chain restructuring required in response to a potential ,16,2023-10-25,2,-0.9985,-0.8604650962682536

181,181,Geopolitics And The Indifference Of Markets,The financial world is full of timeless bits of advice veterans of the system give to those just coming on board One such hoary old saw is to pay no attention to geopoliticsWhile wars terroristThats the advice and there is some pretty solid historical data to support it Consider this past week Last Saturday Israelis woke to the deadliest terrorist attack in their countrys history with a known death toll now exceeding 1300The brutal terrorist attack by Hamas and Israels subsequent declaration of war on the group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 will likely reverberate throughout the Middle East for a longIt will be yet another major foreign policy headache for a world already dealing with the war in Ukraine the everpresent threat of crisis in Taiwan and unsteady domestic politics in much of the developed Western worldYet financial markets have barely registered any reaction at all to the events of October 7 US stock and bond markets have remained focused on their usual themes this week with interest rates and Fedspeak at their customary top of the listBond yields fell significantly after some seemingly dovish comments by a few Fed officials suggested that the recent rise of intermediate and longduration yields might be doing the Feds work for them and thus reduce the urgency for another rate hike when the FOMC meets at the beginning of next monthA mostly inline but slightly hotter than expected inflation report on Thursday took some of the enthusiasm out of that dovish narrativeThe stock market this Friday is mixed with optimism concentrated in the banking sector where the first batch of third quarter earnings reports from heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase  Citi  and Wells Fargo  have received a warm welcomeEven oil markets which could be expected to be much more reactive to events in the Middle East have not gone crazyWhy are markets so blasé about geopolitics There are two main reasons one of which is perfectly rational and the other of which is potentially past its expiration dateFirst the rational explanation It is very hard to translate a geopolitical crisis into a set of known or highly probabilistic outcomes to which a tangible value can be attachedIf we consider those three major flashpoints in todays world  UkraineRussia ChinaTaiwan and IsraelHamas  there is much more fog than clarity about A how the conflicts might be resolved and B what the downstream knockon effects of any such resolution might beThis is a vastly different problem from say mapping out valuation scenarios for growth equities in the technology sector following a onepercent change in interest rates When in doubt leave it out is another one of those old chestnuts shared around securities firm trading floorsThe second reason for the markets usual indifference to world events stems from a longstanding and by now in our opinion outdated assumption that the background scenery of the global political order doesnt change at anything more than a glacial paceThis assumption is rooted in the socalled Washington Consensus that gained popularity back in the 1990s  the belief that free movement of capital lighttouch regulation free trade and globalizationfriendly political systems under the benevolent leadership of the United States was and would continue to be the way of the world That assumption is no longer relevant but it is entirely unclear what is going to replace itWall Streeters often talk of a wall of worry when listing things that while individually perhaps not packing much of a punch pose a threat to asset price trends when added togetherWe would add geopolitical uncertainty to whatever else is piling up on investors wall of worry and are not inclined to dismiss it as irrelevantWe remain comfortable with where our portfolio positioning is today but at the same time we are prepared to expect more rather than fewer surprises in the year ahead The sum,0,2023-10-25,2,0.9794,-0.4117646816609011
182,182,My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,Through September the economy remains solid but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead Currently with the funds rate at 55 and the core CPI at 41 the real funds rate is 14 ThatThe Fed can resume its finetuning operation later if the need arises but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go Ill agree that the bulk of the Feds work is done BUT I dont believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a lastminute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded The firstever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mixraising the odds of a government shutdown in midNovember While this situation wont affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that willThe political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics fiscal spending and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors rating agencies and voters Now to be fair the governments deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yieldsthe markets way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order And the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the governments outofcontrol spending the worse the situation will getIn an era of low inflation and zerolow interest rates Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10year Treasury yield now hovering around 49 With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road fiscal austerity would become a nearterm headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates However that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2 target so this growthinflationinterest rate issue isnt going to be so easy to solve However as I will explain later an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced beforeThe auto workers union is making in my opinion some outrageous demands They are asking for a 40 increase in wages over 4 years a 20 reduction in the workweek from 400 to 320 hours and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of allelectric vehicles The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands poisoned any goodfaith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainableAt the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rankandfile union members The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President Against this background it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly As it progresses the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparentWhile investors seem to be pricing a soft landing history is not on their side The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history and the market is still trying to absorb the impact This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by nearterm macro events As rates have spiked so too have longterm yieldsYield spreads also bear monitoring The spread or difference between 2year and 10year Treasury yields has been negative all year ie an inverted y,4,2023-10-14,3,-0.879,-0.5652173667296797

186,186,Geopolitical Shocks And Portfolio Construction,After Hamas launched horrifying surprise attacks inside Israels borders last weekend theThis has been a week of escalating tragedy on one of the worlds oldest and most violent political and geopolitical fault lines It is the biggest military intelligence and political shock for Israel in decades and it comes on top of deepening internal divisionsToday we consider how investors and asset allocators should think about and respond to events like theseGiven the horror of the attacks the intensity of the response the rolling newsfeed and the history of the region the muted impact onThe ArabIsraeli Yom Kippur War of 1973 has obvious and disturbing similarities to last weeks events Back then initial stock market losses were recovered within a week but the fallout including an oil embargo and numerous policy mistakes worldwide helped trigger stagflation and a multiyear bear marketInvestors appear to recognize that broader ArabIsraeli relations are very different now than they were in 1973 that the world is much less reliant on the regions fossil fuels and that Israel while a much bigger and more advanced economy than it was 50 years ago is still not large enough to roil global marketsThe caveat to this view was ably provided by Admiral James Stavridis NATOs 16th Supreme Allied Commander the 15th Commander of the US European Command and a member of the boards of the Neuberger Berman funds in Admiral Stavridis thinks this conflict is likely to remain a one or twofront war between Israel Hamas and possibly Hezbollah He noted that both Hamas and an emboldened Iran want to derail the potential rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia but anticipates a tactical pause rather than a break in those talks And he assigns a low probability to conflict between Israel and Iran which would likely follow any proof of a direct causative gavetheorder link between Tehran and the Hamas attacksBut he added a stark warning As an investor that is the indicator to watchShould Israel feel compelled to confront Iran the US will be engaged Russia will lean in this instance toward Iran and China which has recently been trying to build a presence in the region could find itself torn awkwardly between alliancesThis is the key point for investors in our view The risk is that ArabIsraeli distrust of Iran may become a more prominent front in tensions among the US China and Russiathe global players involved in existing geopolitical standoffs and the increasing segmentation of the global trade ecosystem Like one in a line of dominoes it has the potential to feed upon and add momentum to existing negative economic and geopolitical trendsWeve been writing about the current environment as In our view an extended period of globalization political and geopolitical consensus and low inflation is giving way to an age of deglobalization populist agitation global tension and higher inflation Weve described the  starting with the Global Financial Crisis followed by the 2016 Brexit and US Presidential votes COVID19 and the invasion of UkraineWe believe those trends are heightening the role of governments in the economy and making economic actors prioritize security over efficiency and prosperity Companies are shortening localizing and simplifying their supply chains where possibleThat is likely to sustain a higher baseline for inflation and make business cycles and markets more volatile all other things being equal We saw further evidence of this with Thursdays US inflation data which showed prices still rising twice as fast as the prepandemic averagenot to mention twice as fast as the central banks targetFrom this dominoes perspective the events in Gaza sit alongside other recent headlines such as the success of the populist Alternative für Deutschland AfD party in last weeks German state elections the unseating of the Speaker of the US House of Representat,2,2023-10-17,2,-0.9825,-0.6999999650000017

188,188,4 Reasons I'm Shorting The VIX Despite Geopolitical Risks,The unexpected attack on Israel reminds us thatBut as investors we must look at the implications for markets and despite the shock I think Israels military dominance is ultimately unshaken by these attacks The blow was psychological and tactical not strategic Israel is a mighty country and I think her military prowess gives potential regional state adversaries pause which limits the potential for a regional conflagration Of course the last two significant eventsWe should all be praying for the victims and their families and we should all be asking ourselves stark questions about the future of the Middle East Still we should also remember that financial volatility while redolent of physical volatility is not the same thing We must remember that the markets collective wisdom shrugs off our individual emotional experiencesThe Hamas attack was deadly and it will have profound implications However it does not look like the type of stateversusstate implications on trade from the Yom Kippur War in 1973 will materialize Furthermore the history of fighting in the ArabIsraeli conflict has typically been marked by short duration rather than the type of resourceintensive stalemate that is going on in UkraineHowever war and the deterioration of foreign relations raise prices theres often no way around it So if this issue expands and intensifies it certainly could raise inflationary pressure so I will keep a close eye on this risk as the events momentum becomes more apparent in the coming days and weeks Im assuming that despite the shock factor of the Hamas attack the effect on markets will be broadly similar to other highintensity periods in the ArabIsraeli Conflict during the 21st centuryWhile the relatively lowintensity conflict between Arabs and Palestinians slowly rumbles through time it doesnt have the same profound economic effects as when a conflict interrupts food production in one of the worlds largest grain producers So I think as devastating and sickening as these attacks were the ultimate effect on global commerce will be much less than Russias Invasion of UkraineIndeed the market has sent two overwhelmingly bullish messages in less than a weekAnecdotally when markets rally on bad news Im typically heartily encouraged I have found this indicative of turning points in the postCOVID markets These two events alone make me very bullish on the disposition of the market into yearend but there are four significant reasons why I will be shorting volatility into the end of the yearI have written extensively before on why I believe have led to the VIX being a somewhat obsolete instrument for catching volatility and why many who expect spikes of levels similar to those seen in COVID19 and the Global Financial will likely be  This is the primary reason why many investors have been fretting about a suppressed VIX To sum up a key conclusion of my prior workOf course a crucial distinction must be made when talking about why the VIX has been suppressed In my past two articles on the VIX I mainly focused on the structural reasons why volatility was relatively more suppressed while navigating an ominous group of postCOVID19 risks than in previous periods when the market faced similar risksYou can see this at play during the recent VIX spike on interest rate fears and volatility that appeared to peak last week The VIX briefly got above 20 but I think it will continue to retreat into yearend given several factors While I am still convinced the structural and market efficiency factors contribute to a more suppressed VIX I think many factors that will work with them to contribute to a suppressed VIX for the rest of the year are also fundamental and seasonal Here are four reasons why I think the VIX will remain suppressed until the end of 20231 The soft landing thesis appears intact The jobs market is proliferating but these arent highpaying jobs that drive inflati,8,2023-10-10,0,-0.8608,-0.6296296063100145

194,194,Why Gold Is A Bad Investment,The ageold debate over whether gold is a worthy investment has continued to occupy the minds of investors even decades after the  was abandoned in 1971 The debate is a rather extensive one encompassing multiple aspects of gold as aAs the investment environment enters a new age marked by monetary policy normalization and escalating geopolitical risks it may be worthwhile to reassess golds potential as an investment not just on its own but also within the context of a diversified portfolioIn this article we shall explore popular arguments both in favour of and against gold as an investment Crucially we shall attempt to debunk some of theBefore we begin it is crucial that we first separate investing from speculation While it is quite common to see investors actively managing their exposure to gold in response to changing macroeconomic fundamentals some firmly believe that gold deserves a permanent allocation within their portfoliosGenerally we identify an investor as someone who intends to maintain a strategic allocation to gold over the entire investment horizon This means that gold is considered a permanent allocation within their portfolios over time while active tactical positioning to moderately increasereduce exposure to gold is acceptable for enhancing returnsIn contrast we associate speculation with the intention to profit from shortterm price action or momentum in gold prices Another telltale sign of speculative behaviour is allornothing trades where a position in gold is bought and sold in its entirety usually in an attempt to profit from a temporary view on prices Below is a table summarising other key differences between the two approachesLet us first explore the reasons why gold may be a good investment Arguments that are in favour of investing in gold typically focus on its ability to provide some form of risk mitigation rather than its ability to generate returns over time These risks include the loss of purchasing power inflation fluctuations in the value of other asset classes diversification and the potential loss of accumulated wealth as a consequence of war geopoliticsOne of the most popular arguments in favour of investing in gold is that the value of the precious metal has held up well over time relative to inflationThe chart below shows how gold in US dollar terms has performed versus the US CPI Index since 1970 Gold has gained by a staggering 5151 to date while the US CPI Index has risen by only 716 We have also added data on the Thomson ReutersCoreCommodity CRB Indesince 1994 which shows that broader commodities prices have risen by a modest 140 to dateClearly gold has demonstrated its value in outperforming inflation over long periods of timeIn the next chart below we have highlighted periods in which the US economy experienced high inflation specifically when US CPI is above 5 We plotted the same set of data on a logarithmic scale to better visualise the magnitude of changes during those periods These include the  of the 19701980 which saw inflation peak at 14 in 1980 and the most recent episode when inflation peaked at 91 in 2022Here the evidence of gold as an effective hedge against inflation in the shorttomedium term is mixed As we can see gold prices actually declined during the period between 1990 to 1992 when inflation averaged around 6 and gold has seen only modest gains from 2021 to dateOverall it seems to us that golds widely touted quality of being an effective hedge against inflation is nothing more than a myth We can certainly make the argument that gold prices have simply risen over time and therefore gold has historically outperformed inflation by a wide margin But this says nothing about gold being endowed with certain qualities that would make it especially effective as a hedge against inflation The evidence we have presented also supports our longheld suspicions that tactical advice encouraging investors t,9,2023-10-10,0,0.9975,-0.21428570663265334

HEFA: Hedging International Exposure Still Working,I just doubled the assets in my traditional IRA by transferring funds from my Pretax 401k plan With funds to invest and my only international exposure in that account being the 33 allocation the With the additional risk an investor takes on when investing outside their home country as EFA would do for any investor in different increments is you take on currency risk For USDbased investors owning the   instead of the EFA ETF helps eliminate that risk When the USDI use the term risk in the sense that there is an extra variable to consider as hedging should cut both ways That said results since 2014 clearly show that owning HEFA was the better choiceThis article builds on and updates this same comparison I did last winter  I chose to be more focused this time so reading the prior article next is suggestedThe only difference with the indices used by these two ETFs is one is USDhedged the other is not MSCI provides this description and facts on the IndexSource Currently the index includes the following 21 countries notice EM ones are excludedAs of the end of July the Index sector allocations and top country weights were and these are reflected in both ETFs reviewedSeeking Alpha describes this ETF asEFA has 94b in AUM and has 33bps in fees The TTM Yield is 22Since the ETF holds the Index in the same allocations I chose not to repeat what is shown in the above pie charts only include additional details The Index Country allocations shown above does not reveal the currency risk EFA holders have Since all currencies do not move the same against the USD this information could be important to some investorsThe EURO and Japanese Yen account for over half the currency exposure with the British Pound and Swiss Franc accounting for another 26 The USD represents both cash and ADR holdingsWith over 800 positions the Top 20 stocks still account for 23 of the portfolio The 400 smallest positions come in at 14 of the weight little but still somewhat meaningfulSeeking Alpha Quant grades EFAs distribution history as a C The EFA ETF shows no pattern of growing its distributions over the past decade With a yield near 2 this might not be a concern as incomeneeding investors would look elsewhere for that goalSeeking Alpha describes this ETF asHEFA has 35b in AUM and the fees are 35bps only two more than EFA The large yearend payout makes the current TTM Yield meaningless A more typical yield is between 24 While it should have payouts close to EFA plusminus hedging income we see later that is not always the caseWith the goal to hedge the MSCI EFA Index the only equity holding HEFA has is owning the other ETF reviewed here that accounts for 98 of the portfolio weight All the other assets are designed to provide for the hedging strategy which has 2 positions for each of these currenciesWhen you compare the hedging weights to the currency weights shown for EFA they are not 100 aligned I assume there are reasons for that that a hedging expert could explain HEFA also has several futures contractsI will compare the two payout levels later but one difference is HEFA has a history of making yearend mostly additional payments sourced from ST  LT Capital Gains as was the case last year Since the only real difference is the hedging strategy these must come from those profitsSince HEFA owns the EFA ETF except for hedginggenerated income I would have thought the regular payouts would match up well they do not I lined up the payments dates as best I could to ease the comparisonsPicking a yield for the HEFA is tough as the TTM yield thanks to the large CG payment is shown as 21 not realistic going forward iShares lists the SEC yield for HEFA as 18 versus 21 for the EFA ETF Not counting 2022 HEFAs income distributions were more each year than for EFA but not by enough to make a real difference or reason to own HEFA over EFAThe next chart includes income a,4,2023-08-10,0,0.9527,0.0

206,206,The Present Geopolitical Situation Is Impossible To Predict,Just as the stock market was trying to shake off spiking bond yields Hamas decided to attack Israeli civilians and Israel understandably has retaliated This situation is moving oil bonds and stocks as the worstcase scenario is a massive oil price spike whichIf this war remains contained to Gaza and Israel and if Hezbollah doesnt attack from Lebanon and if Israel does not bomb Iranian targets making this a broad regional conflict  thats too many ifs  then a fourth quarter rally may still be in the cardsBut we went from worrying about bonds to worrying about a war that just 10 days ago no intelligence agency had any idea was comingIs it possible that Hamass objective from the beginning was to trigger just such a regional war based on the expected Israeli response This is my biggest worry at the moment as a prolonged war will surely impact global financial markets starting with a spike in the oil priceA worstcase scenario would be bullish for bonds no matter what happens to the price of oil as it will cause a deflationary shock I think we saw some of that action last Friday when the bond market rebounded quite significantly from its Thursday selloff and the stock market sold off notablyThe strong correlation we had for most of September and October  where weak Treasury futures meant weak stock index futures  completely disappeared last FridaySome commentators tried to pin the stock market action on weak consumer confidence and higher inflation expectations based on economic releases that came out at 10am that dayI dont believe that for a second It was the stock market being worried about what might happen over the weekend in this explosive geopolitical situationA lot will be decided this week It will be a big positive if the SP 500 holds its October lows It will be an even bigger positive if we make further progress to the upside but I fear that this will all be contingent on whether or not the Israeli situation escalates past GazaWhen the stock market bottomed last October and began to rally it held its key 10 and 20day moving averages all the way until December Investors bought stocks on every pullback After the sharp selloff at the end of last week the SP 500 is sitting on those key moving averages  as of this writing Sunday After I wrote this I saw the US index futures open rather strong on Sunday night with oil and bonds marginally down It looks like the unwinding of the fear trade from Friday I think as long as this war lasts there will be many twists and turns but avoiding a worstcase scenario can lead to the fourth quarter rally Navellier may hold securities in one or more investment strategies offered to its clients Please  for important disclosures located in the About section of the Navellier  Associates profile that accompany this article The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors,3,2023-10-17,0,-0.9616,-0.36842103324099823
207,207,Managing Risk: How Geopolitical Concerns Could Impact Markets,Greg Bonnell Well the conflict involving Israel and Hamas has some assessing how to manage risks in the current market We also have bond yields sitting at around 16year highs So theres a lot going onFor more on how to view these markets joined now by Alexandra Gorwitz vice president and director of active fixed income portfolio management at TD Asset Management Alex great to have you back on the programAlexandra Gorewicz Thanks Greg Great to be hereGreg Bonnell All right so heading into this weekend you and I actually had a conversation about whatAlexandra Gorewicz That theres a lot of uncertainty And how we price that uncertainty is a big unknown right If we think about what happened in September with the huge rise in bond yields and then we had jobs numbers come out both in Canada and the US in early October and is just showing a lot of resilience This tightening of financial conditions this tightening of monetary policy just doesnt seem to be having an impact on the real economyAnd so investors are saying look the future is really uncertain and the things that I thought would happen by this point are not happening The slowdown of the economy is not really coming through So maybe we need to charge more risk premia for the uncertainty and thats manifesting in higher bond yields particularly at the long end of the yield curve 10year and 30year government bondsGreg Bonnell Now when you see a geopolitical risk event of this magnitude you do see the move into gold You see the move into bonds We saw that play out But at the same time we got some dovish comments from Fed speakers talking about that dramatic bond selloff the rise in rates and saying well maybe now Alexandra Gorewicz RightGreg Bonnell The bond market has done our work for usAlexandra Gorewicz Correct So you have these multiple narratives right now that are making it difficult to say with any kind of conviction what is actually driving these moves in markets Obviously the conflict in the Middle East is still very early  too soon to tell whether it becomes more of a regional conflict If it does I think that has the potential to generate a riskoff sentiment globally across financial markets across asset classesBut in the US specifically those call it dovish comments that you were referring to when I said that bond yields have risen that investors are demanding higher risk premium or more yield to hold government bonds with longer durations what Fed members are interpreting that to be is what we call the term premium In other words demanding more compensation for holding longer duration riskAnd for them that does translate ultimately into a tightening of financial conditions or a tightening of credit conditions for the real economy whether its corporations that have been delaying issuing new debt or refinancing because they kept expecting interest rates to come downOr whether its households that have delayed those home purchases in the expectation that mortgage rates would come down Well now that longer bond yields are higher the probability of both of those segments of the economy seeing an alleviation from higher yields is a lot lower And so from the Feds perspective that means that really the bond market its doing its work for themGreg Bonnell So after a year and a half of aggressive central bank rate hikes and then a bond selloff that pushed yields in the bond market to 16year highs are we at a point now where we could say perhaps we have over tightened This has gone too farAlexandra Gorewicz Even before this move in the last several weeks one could have made the argument that there was already over tightening And again like I mentioned you would never know that there was over tightening if you just looked at the labor market although the details even within the labor space are not strong per se Headline numbers are strong but not necessarily the details underne,1,2023-10-11,0,-0.9229,-0.7647058373702448
208,208,Devon Energy: Love Is In The Air,Devon Energys  stock has been beaten down this year as earnings have declined We believe that the selloff is overdone The company is trading at an attractive valuation and is set for positive earnings momentum going in H2 thanksFor those unfamiliar with the company Devon Energy is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company whose operations are focused onshore in the United States Devons operations are located in five geographic areas the Delaware Basin Eagle Ford Anadarko Basin Powder River Basin and Williston BasinAssets located in the Delaware Basin are Devons most valuable assets andThis year Devon has been punished by the market and their stock is down much more than similar firms A potential reason the market may be discounting Devon is  about the quality of their assets and outlook for growth and fears about where we are in the cycle The market may view competitors as being in a stronger position than Devon but we believe even if that is the case the current discount is too wideIn their most recent quarter Devon earned 690 million down from 1932 billion in the year ago period This comparison is a little misleading as commodity prices spiked hard in the year ago period and were at relative lows during Q2 2023 This pattern of lower earnings is common among all oil and gas exposed companies Thanks to higher commodity prices the outlook for Devons operating profitability is looking much better for the second half of this year than it did in the first Analyst estimates are calling for 580 in earnings over the next twelve months We will be referencing this 580 earnings estimate when talking about forward PE for valuation purposesThe decline in Devons earnings does not warrant such poor year to date performance and the stock should be tracking their peers more closelyDevons valuation has continued to get more attractive relative to peers and now trades at an attractive forward PE of 847 Most notable is their discount to Pioneer  as Pioneer is set to be acquired by Exxon  This sets the standard for what sector valuation multiples should trend towards and it is likely that Devons valuation trends higher to narrow that gap Their valuation discount could make Devon an acquisition target In the event of an acquisition it seems reasonable to assume that this discount would narrow considerably could open the door to more MA in the oil and gas sector Chevron  has been looking to get active in MA and apparently  acquiring Occidental  These two events are a sign that activity is set to heat up in the sector and company managements are looking to make moves from a position of strength Now that Exxon has officially made their move it puts pressure on other supermajors and midsized firms to strengthen their asset base or risk getting outcompeted These competitive forces are even stronger in commodity markets than other areas of the economy and as a result deal activity can spread like wildfireDevons assets are complementary to many US oil and natural gas operators as there is a bit of infrastructure overlap in the industry Due to their discount to peers and attractive Delaware Basin assets Devon is no doubt looking like an attractive acquisition target This could help to put somewhat of a floor on the stock and could stoke investor appetite for the sector For Devon investors the main benefit of MA activity heating up is that it adds optionality to what is already an attractive investment In this way MA can be a rising tide that lifts all boatsOur bullish thesis on Devon isnt reliant on MA and the possibility of MA is merely a bonus We believe that Devon represents an attractive buying opportunity for a few reasons The company is fundamentally undervalued relative to their peers The outlook for oil and gas is improving into the end of the year MA activity in the sector could favor Devon due to the nature of their assets and discounte,56,2023-10-18,0,0.998,0.35999998560000057
209,209,Consol Energy: Coal Rebounds As A Hedge Against Geopolitical Strife,Global energy markets are the most sensitive to changes in the geopolitical environment In light of the renewed Middle Eastern crises were seeing bullish strains on oil and a more significant rebound in Eurasian After years of poor performance investors have also become very attracted to coal mining stocks One notable example is CONSOL Energy  historically a leading producer of US thermal coal CEIX has risen by around 91 this year and is stupendously 30 times higher than it was in its 2020 lows CONSOLThe stocks performance has defied the general trend in coal prices As seen in the coal mining producer price index coal miner profit margins have likely declined in 2023 CONSOLs EPS has remained high probably due to price contracts However its stock price has risen dramatically in recent months despite stagnation in its EPS trend See belowGiven the situation I believe it is an excellent time to take a closer look at CONSOL and the US thermal coal market to determine whether or not CEIX is in a price bubble or is simply rising toward its fair value after being undervalued for too longFor the past two decades thermal coal has been the ugly duckling a much disliked energyproducing commodity due to its less clean nature Most Western countries have aggressively shifted toward natural gas which produces less CO2 and other byproducts than coal In 2020 it was generally viewed that Asian countries would quickly follow suit causing thermal coal to become a relic of the past However as global instability rose with the lockdowns and subsequent geopolitical conflicts coal has returned as a more viable commodity Compared to natural gas coal is far more abundant  and most importantly is not exposed to the immense conflict risks of natural gas as gas pipelines become a primary geopolitical target  As Europe has lowered its Russian gas imports it has dramatically increased US LNG imports causing far less US LNG to flow toward Asia As such Asian countries have significantly increased coal imports to offset lost LNG  be record years for global coal consumption Unsurprisingly CEIX has risen in response to the IsraelHamas war up around 9 since October 6th Fundamentally any threats to the EuropeanMiddle East natural gas trade will create upward pressure on Asian coal demand as  toward Europe instead of AsiaOf course with CEIX being so expensive today compared to its 5year range we must consider whether or not it is reasonably priced to that response For one coal prices are still far below 2022 levels The company is producing around the AppalachiaIllinois area which has seen coal prices drop by over 70 since the 2022 peak See belowThere is a vast difference between CONSOLs EPS and the coal miner PPI and spot coal prices because most coal miners use fixedprice contracts and derivatives to minimize income volatility CONSOL also directly exports around twothirds of its production abroad so its sales are often at European and Asian prices are around 70ton higher typically holding the same pattern as US spot prices Since it owns a central marine terminal it also earns around 100M in quarterly sales 16th of the total from fees from other coal miners using its infrastructure Thus while the general trend in coal spot prices is essential CONSOL is diversified and has a significant edge against most US competitorsAs the  mentioned all of its 2023 production was contracted while 176M of its 2024 production or 6575 of the total was contracted For the most part we can expect that CONSOL will earn income in any given quarter based roughly on prices one year prior  the company realized an average price of 8127ton at a cash cost of 3633 per ton both in line with guidance figures The company also mentioned that its 2024 pricing was in the  but has not given specific price points since it was still making contracts Its contracts will likely be around that l,2,2023-10-19,0,0.4216,-0.4444444197530878

213,213,"Stock Market: We Ain't Crashing, And Here's Why",Market commentators including some writers on Seeking Alpha are stepping up quantity and intensity of crash predictions I understand analysts like to point at concerning 1 signals in technical analysis 2 events in the Middle East and broader global geopolitical tensions 3 inflationTechnical analysis is a methodology that involves studying historical stock price and volume data with the goal of predicting future price movements With that said a look at the SP 500 chart reveals a concerning situationIgnore technical analysis if you want to make money with stocks Thats right go ahead close those charts wave goodbye to those oscillators and toss those Fibonacci lines into the trash As I see it and you may of course agree technical analysis doesnt predict future events or factors that may affect stock prices such as economic developments or company performance I have a feeling that technical analysis predicted 78 out of the past 3 crashes Moreover technical interpretation of charts and patterns can vary between analysts leading to very subjective judgments Whatever I argued above on a monthly weekly and daily basis is likely not be echoed by another student of chartsAs a key argument for a stock market crash market commentators like to point to the risk brought about by the recent outbreak of fighting in Israel and Hamas Reasons for concern include potential for geopolitical tensions as well as a probable oil price rally on supply chain disruptions However most of the concerns relate to a broader conflict in the Middle East beyond Israel and Hamas that engages the US and Iran in a proxy war As I see it this consideration is more of a tailrisk rather than reasonable future projections And prematurely responding to this with a stock market crash would be nothing short of stupidMoreover while the conflict in the Middle East is very unfortunate from a market perspective there is little argument for concern In a previous article I have  what happened to US equities during major Middle East conflicts covering 1 the SixDay War of 1967 2 the Gulf War 19901991 3 the Iraq War 20032011 and 4 the Arab Spring 20102011 The takeaway was quite consistent Stocks are do not show a tendency to go bearish on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East In fact following an initial period of elevated market volatility US equities like to make new highs within 1218 months from the conflict outbreakMarkets are forward looking Markets are rarely interested in trends that happened in the past What is interesting to markets is the rate of change And as I observe it the rate of change in both inflation and interest rates is favorable Latest data points on core inflation show the CPI trending towards 3 YoY growth Meanwhile wage growth is dropping towards the 50year historical average of 4 YoY These easing pressure points on pricing contribute to a favorable rates outlook as by JP Morgan With this context investors should consider that if the aggressive  past hiking path in interest rates didnt crash the markets although it did in 2021 then the next leg in the path forward namely rates going down wont do it eitherAdmittedly even though inflationary headwinds and rates pressure are easing the high implied time value of money is still a concern to many investors However investors concern on rates will likely be a headwind to upside it wont be a catalyst for downside And what I am saying in this article is not that we are rallying but that we aint crashingFinally investors are concerned about the valuation of the SP 500 citing an implied 2024 PE of close to 18x But I have a very hard time buying the valuation story First I point out that on an aggregate level the valuation of US equities is relatively in line with historical metricsIn that context the graph below provides a comparative assessment of major asset classes and styles in relation to,22,2023-10-28,0,-0.8968,-0.7272726942148775

216,216,"The Fed Is Done Hiking, And The Holidays Are About To Begin",Last week Jay Powell gave a critical speech where he got pretty frank about monetary policy One of the simplest things he said that anyone can understand is that the Fed takes the economy as it comes Stating it another way he affirmed that theyHowever the economic strength seen so far has mainly been positive and the strength of the consumer has been impressive Particularly since productivity and participation have trended in a good direction too The conversation Powell had was primarily received as a bearish development by the market but IThe probability of the next meeting of a hike is technically  by some measures Of course these are always implied probabilities that should be taken with a grain of salt though Furthermore something has cropped up on many Fedwatching tools that havent been there for a while The probability of easing has started to filter back into the modelsSo while the Fed has maintained a dedication to vanquishing inflation if it crops back up the data has shown the fight has largely been one The core inflation crucial to Fed decisionmaking is under 3 now at the 3month and 6month intervals as  in his speech But the reaction function has begun to evolve As you can see below by May 2024 the expectation shifts to a more significant probability of cuts than hikesSo the Fed has maintained the tough talk and if you think about it had to One of the things Powell mentioned in his speech at the Economic Club of New York was that 50 years ago when Milton Friedman came up with the phrase the relationship between the Fed and the market was fundamentally different But based on what the market is currently saying and how inflation is currently trending this hiking cycle is likely overNot only that but the economy has proven  to high rates which is also a further implication If the economy faces a significant risk the Fed has plenty of bazooka rounds to help cushion the economic impact of it This was not the case for much of the last couple of decades Higher rates specifically higher rates driven by the term premium rather than economic strength are helping the Fed ensure inflation doesnt pop back up without another hikeThe market essentially responded to Fed open market operations after their occurrence instead of anticipating them in the past When you think of the consequences from the vantage point of the Fed Chair youll want to wear your pistol where people can see it lest their behavior gets too far away from where you want it to be In my last piece about the Fed I mentioned some other ways the economy had changed and why that might explain how some people have very different thoughts about how prevalent inflation is vs Theres a famous quote by contrarian investor John Templeton  I consider myself a contrarian investor and I greatly respect the distinguished and honorable Mr Templeton and the critical insight he was trying to convey I would summarize the critical insight from this quote as always being cognizant of how the perennial driver of human psychology will repeatedly lead to maniacal thinking concerning investmentsBut its also important to consider other things that will be consistent like seasonal factors The fact that there will likely be seasonal relief on gasoline should mitigate the chances of a problematic spike in inflation expectations for instanceAnd Powell has said clearly that the evidence so far is that financial conditions do not appear overly tight I agree with what Fed President  Absent a stark turn in what I see in the data and hear from contactsI believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are All indications are that American consumers and businesses have been strong enough to weather these financial conditions Countervailing forces of government spending should help mitigate the depth of a typical cyclical slowdownOf course a monetary policy lag could sucker punch the economy but I don,47,2023-10-27,0,0.9907,0.3333333055555579

218,218,Warren Buffett's Simple Path To Wealth: 'Just Sit And Think',Billionaire investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway  once He also These quotes are very relevant to investors today given the current rhetoric and volatility gripping markets right now In this article we will look more closely at the meaning and implications of Mr Buffetts quotes and then share how it is impacting our investment decisionmaking process right nowThe two aforementioned WarrenWith the AI boom rising interest rates uncertainty about the future direction of inflation a wall of corporate and commercial real estate debt maturing in the coming years signs of cracks beginning to form in the economy and two ongoing major regional conflicts in Ukraine and Israel that are threatening to expand into much broader conflicts there is plenty to get crazy about in todays stock market As a result many investors are tempted to react impulsively to these trends by selling their plummeting REITs  utilities  and other highyielding dividend growth stocks and instead put it all into the soaring technology stocks that are benefiting from the AI boom like NVIDIA  Palantir  and Meta However Buffetts quote reminds us that such emotional reactions can be detrimental to ones longterm financial successInstead the Oracle of Omaha urges investors to adopt a calm and rational approach by ignoring the markets maniacal behavior driven by a myriad of factors such as news events emotions and speculation Instead of constantly chasing the hot stock or sector of the moment Buffett suggests that investors should keep their emotions in check and stay focused on their longterm investment goals Many times this involves simply doing nothing even when our greatest emotional urges tell us to sell all of our losers and chase the markets recent winnersSitting and thinking can also help an investor not succumb to impulsive decisions and instead stick to a wellthoughtout investment strategy with the longterm in view Successful stock market investing is not about outperforming the market every day week month or even every year It is about buying good businesses at discounts to their intrinsic value and then being willing to sit back and wait patiently until the market gives you an attractive offer for your businessAs a highyield dividend investor this approach is even psychologically easier for me since I can keep my focus on the passive income stream rather than the daily market value of my portfolio Since I view my portfolio as a cash flow machine at the end of the day I crave market volatility since it often provides me with opportunities to separate myself from the pack by behaving in a contrarian manner and accelerating the growth of my passive income snowballRather than changing my investment strategy with each new bubble  which would have required me to be a Bitcoin maniac  in 20182019 a disruptive technology  maniac in 20202021 and an AI bull in 20222023   and risk buying the top and selling the bottom each time I have chosen the simpler and more boring path of buying highly profitable businesses that pay out attractive dividends to shareholders whenever they fall out of favor with Mr Market This approach requires me to do nothing through the evershifting cycles of market manias and panics and instead reinvest my dividends into whatever the most attractively priced dividend stocks are at the time For me  and Mr Buffett  time in the market is far more important than timing the market As my passive income snowball grows ever larger its rate of growth also accelerates due to having more passive income to reinvest each quarter resulting in an exponential growth curve for my income streamSo how is that translating into my investment decisions today Well given that the majority of my portfolio is invested in utilities yield cos REITs midstream and other infrastructure  almost all of whom have traded down in recent weeks and months while tech stocks ,5,2023-10-18,0,0.9878,0.14285713605442207
219,219,UVXY: Potential Middle East War Is A Tail Event (Ratings Upgrade),In my most recent  on the ProShares Ultra VIX ShortTerm Futures ETF  I recommended investors avoid the UVXY ETF because of its extreme value decay in the long runHowever I did note that during timesWith an escalating IsraelGaza war potentially morphing into a tail event I am raising my prior sell rating in the UVXY ETF to a  rating as I believe the nearterm upside and downside risks are more balanced at the moment Historically warsWhile I do not recommend longterm investors get involved in the UVXY ETF shortterm speculators can consider a long position in the UVXY ETF provided they understand the bet they are making Furthermore the UVXY ETF may be useful as a shortterm hedge for investors with long equity exposureOne of the most leveraged investments to shortterm volatility is the UVXY ETF The ProShares Ultra VIX ShortTerm Futures ETF invests in shortdated VIX futures with a weighted average maturity of 1 month to provide 15x exposure to shortterm VIX futures Currently the UVXY ETF holds a 135 weight in VIX November futures and a 15 weight in October futures Figure 2As time passes and the VIX futures get closer to maturity the UVXY ETF will sell the nearest term future and redeploy the proceeds into the secondmonth future to maintain 15x exposure to the weighted average maturity of 1 monthThe constant selling and buying of nearterm futures to maintain its 15x leverage cause the UVXY ETF to suffer from volatility decay Furthermore since the VIX futures curve is generally in contango ie futures further out the curve are priced higher see Figure 3 that means in general the UVXY ETF must sell lowerpriced expiring contracts to buy higherpriced futures farther out in maturity losing money in the processThe combination of these two effects contango and volatility explains why the UVXY ETF has compounded at 828 pa since inception Figure 4The UVXY ETF is definitely not a buyandhold investment A million dollars invested at UVXYs inception would be worth less than 1 In fact most of the time I recommend investors stay as far away from the UVXY ETF as possibleHowever as we noted at the beginning of this article during tailrisk events the UVXY ETF can deliver phenomenal returns in a short period of time and some investors may wish to take advantage of UVXYs properties to hedge their portfolios The ongoing IsraelGaza war could be one such tail eventTo preface I am not a geopolitical expert and this article is not meant to support either side in this war I am merely analyzing the developing war from the perspective of financial marketsThe latest phase in the longstanding IsraelGaza conflict began in the early hours of October 7th 2023 when the Hamas militant group  a surprise attack on Israel killing and kidnapping thousands of civilians Israel retaliated against the attack by bombing and laying siege to the Gaza Strip where Hamas is basedAfter a week of bombings speculation is that Israel will soon  a groundbased invasion of Gaza to wipe out Hamas However Iran  of farreaching consequences if Israel proceeds with its invasion Furthermore Israel has  Syrias Aleppo airport potentially escalating this war into a regional conflict with multiple opponentsAside from the humanitarian disaster an escalation of the IsraelGaza war threatens regional stability in the Middle East and oil prices Recall that the OPEC oil embargo in 1973 was  by OPEC in response to the United States siding with Israel during the Yom Kippur War Oil prices quadrupled in the aftermath of the embargo sparking a recession in the US Figure 5Even without an oil embargo oil prices can still spike on wars For example when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 oil prices spiked to over 120  barrel 25 increase and the VIX Index rallied to over 36 Figure 6Similarly during the first Gulf War the SP 500 declined by 20 when oil prices more than doubled to 40  b,102,2023-10-26,0,-0.996,-0.8181817809917372

226,226,"IWM: Long Small Caps, Short Mega Caps As The 'Concentration Bubble' Unwinds",Over the past decade stock market performance has been substantially skewed toward larger capitalization companies The current tenyear total return for the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF  is 227 while it is only 99 for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF Clearly some trend is pushing Mega Cap performance that is not impacting smaller equities The discrepancy is not apparent in their fundamentals The Mega Cap ETF MGC currently has a TTM weightedaverage PE of 24XFurther from a discounted cashflow standpoint MGC is subject to greater cashflow discounting devaluation due to the rise in interest rates more so than IWM As we saw in 2022 higher interest rates usually upset the prices of highvaluation stocks much more than lowvaluation ones such as those in IWM However both ETFs had a negative performance of around 20 in 2022 however IWM has maintained its discount while MGC has recovered despite the continued increase in interest ratesThose who follow my research likely know I am extremely bearish on megacap stocks due to their immense valuation growth Since small caps and large caps have been in a seesaw relationship for some time the bearish potential for the most expensive stocks may finally lift the valuations for smaller capitalization firms Of course while IWM appears extremely cheap negative economic trends could weigh on its fundamentals So we must gauge the macroeconomic outlook and IWMs exposures to discern if it is appropriately discounted for potential earnings trendsTo me it appears that these companies such as Apple are rising due to momentum created from excess ETF concentration Essentially because almost all ETFs are marketcapitalization weighted stocks with high market capitalizations will naturally see more significant inflows from ETFs as they rebalance creating a positive feedback loop that can push valuations to extremes Today this trend has reached such an extreme that half of the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  is just two stocks Apple  and Microsoft  Of course while this trend may continue for some time I expect it will end very poorly for many investors because should the megacaps begin to fall the opposite pattern should arise as ETFs automatically rebalance away from these firms creating an adverse feedback loopGoing back at least 30 years we can see a very interesting pattern between large caps in the SP 500 and small caps in the Russell 2000 During the end of the 1990s when the first technology bubble occurred small caps underperformed dramatically As the bubble popped and value stocks returned in vogue in the 2000s small caps total performance was strong enough to erase all underperformance created in the 1990s Since 2012 the market has looked more like it did in the 1990s with larger companies seeing massive inflows while small caps fall by the waysideToday most of the recovery in small caps from the 2000s has reversed with the total performance ratio nearing 2000 minimum levels or when the Dotcom bubble peaked Assuming this pattern will continue we can expect around 4060 in outperformance from IWM compared to the SP 500 over the coming five to ten years Of course that is merely based on the total return pattern That said it seems reasonable considering IWM is trading at a 50 valuation discount to megacaps If the threeyear forward valuation in IWM equaled that of MGC IWM would need to outperform by  100 However if we account for the fact that IWMs constituents naturally have greater negative EPS exposure to the economic cycle it is reasonable that it should trade at a lower valuation than MGC and the SP 500 however a 50 discount is to me entirely unreasonableIn general the largest companies in the US stock market are multinational firms such as Apple Amazon  Microsoft Google  Tesla  and others The direct cyclical exposure of these firms EPS to the GDP growth rate is vague but w,4,2023-09-18,0,0.912,-0.3846153550295881

233,233,Why Holding About 50% In Cash Equivalents Makes Sense For Investors Right Now,Recessions and bear markets will occur as long as free markets exist Pretending they dont exist or dont matter is not a good way to get betterthanaverage investment returns And those investors who ignore the possibility of long bearHere is how my cash position has progressedAt the beginning of 2022 after being nearly fully investedAt the beginning of this year I thought investors should be prepared for a 30 decline in the SP 500 Here is how the SP 500 ETF  and the Equal Weighted SP 500 ETF  have performed so far this yearAs you can see neither one of them is down 30 even though there is a big divergence between the returns of the two In this article I explain why I have roughly maintained my overall cash positioning this year I still have about a 45 cash equivalent position in my individual accounts and about a 60 cash equivalent position in my 401k I also explain why I think it is wise for most investors to have somewhere between 40 and 60 in cash right nowBefore we get into the likely reasons why the SP 500 has rallied this year its important to point out that bear market rallies are normal and in my opinion we are still in a bear marketThe above chart is of total returns since January 1st 2022 It is important to keep in mind that in the US we have had about 12 inflation during this time as well so in terms of actual purchasing power we need to subtract about 12 more from the displayed returns above The worst performer by far has been longduration government bonds which have lost half their purchasing power in two years These are often pitched as safe to investors or ballasts for portfolios The best thing investors could have done is avoid these at all costs over the past several years Even though the percentage decline in value isnt as bad over this period as Cathy Woods utterly dismal Ark Innovation Fund  the magnitude of losses in government bonds is probably in the hundreds of billions which dwarfs ARKK in terms of total value lost and I dont think even the most gullible investors ever though ARKK was safe Even if the value of these bonds ultimately recovers over the next two decades its hard to imagine how inflation doesnt eat away at least half of the purchasing powerNext we see that Vanguards Balanced Index Fund  which is what I use as a 6040 portfolio proxy is down 11 Even the mighty  and the everpopular Dividend ETF  remain in a bear market Only my preferred cash equivalent  has produced a positive return since January 2022 with a 6 return which is still about 6 less than inflation but its at least close and in 2023 TFLOs return has surpassed that of inflationOverall my individual portfolios are down about 6 over this period even though Ive been consistently adding growth stocks while maintaining about a 45 TFLO weighting So my overall defensive positioning hasnt caused me to suffer much since 2022 relative to QQQ and SPY even with the bear market rally we have seen this yearI think there are four main reasons SPY has rallied this year relative to the equalweighted RSP The first is that student loan repayments were successfully delayed by the Biden Administration for nearly two years until they finally resumed this month These repayments will be a huge drag on the economy and dramatically increase the odds of a recession each month as time goes on as this money is sucked out of the economyThe second reason is there is a mismatch between shortterm interest rates and rates that people and businesses were able to lock in for the long term when rates were very low So what has happened so far is investors in shortduration treasuries money markets and CDs are now collecting about 5 interest but those people like myself with a sub3 fixed mortgage or even people with 4 longterm fixed auto loan which can now be as long as 6 or 7 years are not paying higher rates yet In the short term as a commen,234,2023-10-12,0,0.9316,-0.39130433081285515

242,242,Tesla Is Bound To Move Above $380,Its time for a revisit to   since  of the stock Tesla has increased production above our previous forecasts which is great and has managed to maintain its position as a market leader in termsSo what is needed to take Tesla to new highs The green transition is the main catalyst although we also expect Tesla to maintain a strong market share and improve profit margins We believe all pieces are in place for Tesla shares to continue their positive pathTeslas ability to remain the market leader for the past years manifests as proof of its quality and brand recognition around the world Tesla is alsoHowever the main catalyst for Tesla is the Paris Agreement and the legislative initiatives that stem from it Based on those premises the transition toward an electrified vehicle industry is mandatory and Tesla is perfectly positioned to benefit from itThe company has seen an exponential growth rate since 2016 driven by a strong global demand and Tesla has a bold goal to deliver  If Tesla manages to maintain its exponential growth rate of 50 per annum this target may be reached in just a few years time However we believe 20 million EVs is a bit of a stretch To reach 15 million EV deliveries per annum in the next ten years is realisticTesla is now planning a  this time in Mexico with production estimated to begin in late 2024 or Q1 2025 with an annual capacity of reportedly 12 million vehicles This would take EV deliveries up to 34 million vehicles per year for Tesla Theres no doubt Tesla will keep announcing new factories as global demand continues to surgeContinued demand for electric vehicles is a focal point for Teslas ambitious growth plans The fact is that the  with sales seeing exponential growth rates In 2022 10 million EVs were sold and its market share has more than tripled in the last three years from around 4 in 2020 to 14 in 2022 The IEA expects EV sales to reach 14 million by the end of 2023 a 35 YoY increase This trend should continue as country officials keep enacting on the Paris Agreement and take us toward a more sustainable societyFurthermore global car production for 2023 is expected to end at 70 million vehicles per year and by 2030 well likely see a global production of 100 million cars per year  all new cars and vans are planned to be electric in the EU and we expect 7080 of global deliveries to be EVs by 2040 Hence its highly plausible that Tesla will reach 15 million yearly EV deliveries in the next ten yearsOne important move towards netzero emissions is the European Unions adoption of the new CO2 standards for cars and vans in March 2023 where carbon emissions are to be reduced by 55 and 50 for new cars and vans respectively by 2030 compared to 2021 and 100 for both by 2035 This new legislation poses a strong growth catalyst for Tesla shares Tesla is well positioned to capture on this opportunity through its Berlinbased Gigafactory and most likely one more factory will be announced soon as demand prospects within the EU remain strong We also expect similar legislative initiatives to be adopted around the world in the near future and as mentioned we anticipate 7080 of global vehicle production to be EVs by 2040Tesla also offers geographical diversification in a time of geopolitical uncertainty and when the US EV market struggles with price cuts and rising inventories With its geographically spread Gigafactories Tesla ensures a steady and costefficient supply of its EVs by staying close to the end customer while at the same time capturing the rising trend for global EV demandTurning to valuation total  by an average of 50 for the last three years 2019 to 2022 from 246 billion to 815 billion Revenue growth is highly correlated with vehicle sales which has had a similar growth rate for the same period and we expect automotive sales to be the driving positive factor of future growth  ASP as competition tightens is the ,380,2023-10-16,0,0.9976,0.636363578512402
243,243,"ArcelorMittal: A Solid Steel Play, That Simple",The steel industry may not be the most exciting in the markets right now its not nearly as broadly covered as AI for example But that isnt to say there arent some very good deals in this market currently ArcelorMittal SA The last  showcased the company having some trouble getting shipments up as the pricing environment has become less favorable for it I think however that prices are likely to return higher as interest rates go down not only in the US but around the world and construction projects become more appealing andMT stands as a global powerhouse in the steel manufacturing industry As the secondlargest steel producer worldwide the company achieved a remarkable feat in 2022 with an annual production of 88 million tonnes of crude steel and revenues nearing the 7984 billion mark This impressive scale and financial prowess position MT at the forefront of the steel industry ready to tackle new opportunities and challenges on a global scaleMT is a highly vertically integrated company that encompasses the entire spectrum of the steel industry Its operations span from cuttingedge research and development to mining manufacturing and distribution of steel products The company is wellpoised to capitalize on major global trends such as the substantial increase in construction expenditures which are driving the demand for steel across the world With its diverse capabilities and alignment with these megatrends MT is a compelling player in the steel industryThe  is a key point to watch with MT as it helps gauge the potential they have for growing and expanding As we can see above they have done a fantastic job at bringing down the net debts and growing into a more flexible financial position as a result The interest costs are declining steadily as a result leaving more earnings available for distribution by the company MT has been able to deliver a strong shareholder return thanks to the buyback programs they have begun Since just 2020 the outstanding shares have declined by around 30 This has ensured strong shareholder value and in my opinion is the reason for the continued uptrend the share price has been on recently as wellThe steel market has been quite volatile over the last few years and this has of course affected the earnings of companies like MT In 2021 the earnings exceeded 14 billion the highest in the companys history This enabled them to buy back significant amounts of shares and also pay down debt and end up in a better financial position as wellThe company  to note though that the activity in the industry remains quite lackluster and poor But what is fundamentally going to drive demand in the medium to long term at least I think is the low inventory levels that companies have The real demand for the first half of 2023 remains stable and that is really what anyone could have asked for in my opinion The war in Ukraine has made commodities markets around the world quite volatile and rising interest rates have softened demand somewhat as well If we see a rise in the shipments for MT further I think that is a good indication of trends reversing and we are heading for higher earningsThe steel industry is closely tied to key sectors like automotive engineering and construction However these sectors are currently grappling with significant macroeconomic uncertainties that have the potential to dampen demand Factors such as ongoing global trade tensions evolving government policies and geopolitical events are casting a shadow over these industries These uncertainties are not only affecting steel manufacturers but also posing challenges for the entire supply chain The steel industry must navigate this complex landscape and adapt to changing market conditions to ensure its sustainability and growthMT currently boasts a formidable position which I believe is quite robust With a market capitalization exceeding 21 billion they stand among the industrys giants ,2,2023-09-21,0,0.9963,0.15384614792899431

246,246,Gold Is Not An Ideal Long-Term Buy Yet,With all the headspinning events taking place right now on the geopolitical front investors are having a hard time understanding why golda traditional safehaven in times of turmoilhas underperformed Given the extent of the fear in the news headlines yellow metalBut what market participants often fail to see is that gold is overvalued by a couple of key metrics which partly explains its failure by and large to respond to the growing number of international wars and other political and economic developments notably the persistence of inflationConsider the GraniteShares Gold Trust ETF  which closely tracks the gold price As I noted back in May in a previous Seeking Alpha  since gold is priced in dollars the relentless strength of the US dollar index was a big reasonFastforward to October and gold still faces a major obstacle from the strong dollar due to the yellow metals currency component BAR has rallied in recent days as the above chart shows but this is likely due more to the impact of warrelated short covering and shortterm panic than a genuine reversal of golds bigpicture trendThen theres the competition offered to nonyielding bullion by a runaway rally in US Treasury yields As investors chase higher bond yields gold is largely ignored and has suffered the negative effects of the 16year highs in the 10year Treasury Yield Index TNXBeyond the fact that gold is being challenged by bond market and currency strength is the observation some analysts have made in recent weeks concerning golds unresponsiveness to lingering inflation in the US This is the case made by many analysts who point out that the precious metal has likely already discounted any additional future increase to the US inflation rateHowever a much more compelling explanation for golds sluggish performance was offered by economic blogger Scott Grannis who  that according to inflationadjusted standards gold is actually expensiveIndeed he goes on to note that over the last century gold as measured in todays dollars has averaged about 780 an ounce Today its worth 150 more than that today or 1940 see chart below for an illustration This suggests that until interest rates come down significantly investors wont have much of an incentive to load up on nonyielding gold at current pricesMoreover Grannis goes on to point out that 5year Treasury InflationProtected Securities or TIPS tend to lead gold prices Specifically the inverse of the TIPS real yield shows a longterm tendency to precede major longterm moves in the gold price As the following chart shows theres a conspicuous spread between gold and TIPS with the latter suggesting the former asset could come down even further before eventually attracting attention from bargainhunting investorsIn view of the factors mentioned heremost notably US currency and Treasury yield strengthIm recommending that investors avoid the temptation to start major longterm positions in gold If the analysis discussed here is correct a much better opportunity for purchasing gold should occur when inflation begins to significantly diminish as reflected by falling Treasury yields and a weaker US dollar   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body,23,2023-10-14,0,0.9571,-0.5238094988662143
247,247,Will The Fed Trigger Another Crisis Event?,As the narrative grows the risk of a  event in the economy increases Will the Fed trigger another crisis event While unknown the risk seems likely as the Feds  narrative isSuch is a question worth asking as we look back at the Feds history of previous monetary actions Such was a topic I discussed in  To witHistorically when the Fed hikes interest rates and yield curves invert someone inevitability pushes the But that is also the fallacy in the 1995 scenario the media is currently pinning its hopes on Indeed the economy did not slip into a recession however there were crisis events along the way More importantly the yield curve did not invert in 1995 However it inverted in 1998 and a recession followed roughly 24 months laterThe chart above shows that yield curve inversions occur roughly 1024 months before recognizing a recession or crisis event This is because it takes time for the  of higher borrowing costs to negatively impact the economyWhile the Fed hopes individuals will act rationally as they tighten monetary policy investors tend not to act that way But what the markets are likely missing is that we are not just talking about the Feds monetary policy decisions in isolationWe currently live in the most highly leveraged economic era in US history As of Q2 of 2023 the total measurable leverage in the economy is 97 trillion The entire economy is currently at 222 trillion so it requires 436 in debt for each 1 of economic growth Critically that level of debt has nearly doubled since 2008 when it stood at 54 trillion and the economy was roughly 16 trillion in value In other words in just 13 years the economic leverage rose from 338 per 1 of growth to 436 That massive surge in leverage was made possible by nearzero interest rates during that periodGiven the financial systems leverage the collision of debtfinanced activity with restrictive financial conditions will lead to weaker growth Historically such increases in financial conditions have always preceded recessionary onsets and crisis events Notably those events occurred at substantially lower levels of overall leverageIf we look at the annual rate of change in total system leverage versus changes in interest rates we find about a 36month lag from when rates increase to a crisis event Given that rates started to rise in 2021 such suggests the next crisis event will occur later in 2024As noted above confirmation of the timing of the next recession or crisis event in 2024 comes from the yield curve inversions Historically when yield curves invert the media proclaims a recession is coming However when it doesnt immediately manifest they assume its  We just arent there yet as the  has yet to take holdDue to the amount of stimulus injected into the economy and the stillelevated levels of money supply as a percentage of the economy the recessionary onset likely will be akin to the 2006 episodeSimply just because the collision of higher borrowing costs reduced money supply and slowing economic growth hasnt caused a crisis or recession yet doesnt mean it wontIn  we discussed how a crisis event is possible if interest rates rise the Fed tightens monetary policy or the economic recovery faltersMost importantly over the last decade the primary rationalization  Unfortunately with inflation elevated which shrinks profit margins and high interest rates valuations are likely a more significant issue than most suspectAs At the moment we dont know when the next  will arriveHowever it is only a function of time until the Feds higher for longer causes someone to push the big red button The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editorsAfter having been in the investing world for more than 25 years from private banking and investment management to private and venture capital I have pretty much been there and done that at one point or another I am currently ,19,2023-10-14,0,-0.5971,-0.9999999629629643

251,251,The Time To Plan For Tomorrow Is Today, shows that the vast majority of individual investors  and even the majority of active professional money managers  do not even achieve the total returns of the SP500 let alone beat the market There are of course many reasons why this is the case But theMany years ago I put all my investments into a spreadsheet and began tracking itNow before I go any further and in hopes to minimize the number of comments that will point it out  There are a plethora of factors that should impact any individual investors portfolio decision making age networth workingretired goals risk tolerance taxes  well you get the picture Please keep this in mind when I discuss the sample portfolio structure belowI prefer taking  That is I look at my total liquid networth and allocate capital into the various  for which I want exposure A sample portfolio implementing such a strategy is shown belowThis sample portfolio has allocated 50 toward the SP500 In my case this is accomplished primarily with investments in the Vanguard SP500 ETF  and the Fidelity 500 Index Fund  These are longterm holdings in which I never sell but will typically and readily add to during times of big market corrections as in last years bear marketThe dividend income category for myself is primarily energy stocks ConocoPhillips  Phillips66  Chevron  Exxon Mobil  and Enbridge  These stocks have delivered excellent dividend growth over the decades that I have owned them That said many retired investors have been advised brainwashed into vastly overemphasizing the dividend income category simply because they are retired and despite the fact that many can live just fine on the combination of their pensions social security and investments I discuss this issue in one of my most popular Seeking Alpha articles  From what I gather from writing articles on Seeking Alpha and reading thousands of comments this is probably the 1 reason why retired investors significantly lag the returns that the market is more than willing to give them via the SP500Being an engineer the growth category of my portfolio is primarily directed at the Technology Sector and is my attempt to outperform the market ie the SP500 These stocks include the Invesco Nasdaq100 Trust  Amazon  Google  Broadcom  and Jabil   most of which have beaten the SP500 over the time frames in which I have owned themI question whether or not the sector specific category is worth the time and effort and if I would simply be better off simply moving the proceeds into the SP500 Some of these are legacy positions prior to my change in portfolio strategy and include ETFs in the Defense  Aerospace sector  Consumer Staples  Utilities  Healthcare  and  of course  the Technology Sector the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology ETF  the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF  and the iShares Expanded TechSoftware ETF   among a few others Other than the technology funds these funds give me some diversification but have generally lagged in comparison to the SP500The speculative growth category includes higher riskreward opportunities and typically contains stocks that I watch with an eagleeye For instance one of my speculative investments was in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust  which I invested in after I noticed that PayPal and Square announced they were supporting the crypto see  This turned out to be one of the fastest appreciating investment I have ever made  tripling in a matter of weeks I eventually sold half to cover my original cost basis and later sold the other half on the way down To be fair I have also had my fair share of failures  most recently in Akoustis  a company with great technology but a terrible stock Regardless the goal of the speculative growth category is for the successes to far outweigh the failures such that the longterm performance of the category beats the SP500 More conserva,35,2023-10-21,0,0.9976,0.19999998666666757

253,253,Buy Gold In October 2023: The Planets Are Aligning For Its Resurgence,ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista  yesterday thatIn this article we are going to look at the various factors that are aligning to lead to what we believe will be a resurgence for gold  in the coming months and yearsThe ongoing conflict in the Middle East has sent shockwaves through global markets with investors rushing to shield their portfolios from the ensuing uncertainty that the conflict may spread throughout the region and ultimately even lead to a conflict that embroils two major oil exporters in Iran and Saudi Arabia Gold with its historical precedent of being a safehaven asset has witnessed a significant jumpMoreover the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe between Russia and Ukraine and its Western Allies as well as the growing tensions in East Asia between North Korea and South Korea and between China and Taiwan  with the potential for catastrophic wars to erupt from any of those hot spots  provide additional incentive to own gold during these geopolitically volatile timesGold has traditionally been an  against inflation With the global economy experiencing significant volatility and uncertainty at the moment and various nations still trying to balance fighting off inflationary pressures with trying to avoid falling into recession gold looks like an increasingly prudent investmentDespite the gold price initially falling more than 11 from its May high due to the Feds hawkish outlook the precious metal still holds potential for price appreciation in the coming yearsAnd it has already begun to make a comeback in recent daysMoreover it seems probable that the US Government will continue its runaway deficit spending for the foreseeable future Consequently this will exert significant pressure on the Federal Reserve to eventually reduce interest rates potentially resulting in negative real interest rates in the long run As a result inflation rates are expected to surpass nominal interest rates creating a highly favorable scenario for gold over the long termAnother reason to be bullish on gold right now is that historically gold has demonstrated a pattern of delivering positive average returns of 071 and 13 in November and December respectively due in part to a rise in jewelry demand and a generally weaker dollar in December As a result if history is any guide buying gold in October could be a great riskadjusted moveThe recent surge in central bank purchases of gold underscores the precious metals enduring appeal amidst global economic and geopolitical tumult Central banks both from advanced economies and emerging marketdeveloping economies EMDE are amassing gold reserves at a pace not seen for over 50 years with these entities accounting for 34 of total gold demand in the third quarter of 2022 and their rapid pace of buying continuing into 2023This buying spree was likely prompted at least in part by the geopolitical upheaval caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant sanctions on Russia prompting a reevaluation of US dollar reserves vulnerability This is evidenced by the fact that 42 of banks anticipate a decline in US dollar holdings according to a World Gold Council  Furthermore nations like Russia and China have been aggressively purchasing gold potentially as a safeguard against foreign asset seizures EMDE banks often more proactive in their goldbuying endeavors than their Western counterparts clearly increasingly view gold not merely as a historical store of wealth but as a strategic asset that provides a buffer against potential payment crises arising from current or future sanctions and insulating their often more fragile economies against global financial crisesIf this strong central bank demand continues  which it is showing no signs of slowing down  it will likely provide a pretty strong tailwind for gold prices over the long termThanks to its multimillennia history of being a safehaven asset gold is once agai,39,2023-10-13,0,0.9808,-0.5384615177514801

257,257,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time,1306,2023-08-14,0,0.7537,-0.35999998560000057

259,259,BDC Weekly Review: How A Rising Term Premium Will Impact BDCs,Welcome to another installment of our BDC Market Weekly Review where we discuss market activity in the Business Development Company BDC sector from both the bottomup  highlighting individual news and events  as well as the topdown  providing an overview of the broader marketWe also try to add some historical context as well as relevant themes that look to be driving the market or that investors ought to be mindful of This update covers the period through the second week of OctoberBDCs were marginally up this week as markets whipsawed on geopolitical concerns and higherthanexpected inflation readings Despite a positive week the sector remains down around 25 on the monthValuations have recovered slightly from the recent slide but stand around 5 below the recent peakManyWe can see this rise in the term premium a couple of different ways One academic definition of the term premium shows that its moved into positive territory and is not far off the top of the rangePerhaps a more intuitive definition of the term premium is simply the difference between 10Y and 2Y Treasury yields as shown below This has risen as well but remains well below its longerterm rangeWhat drives the term premium A common answer is the debt load  the higher the debt the higher the term premium investors require and viceversa US debt outstanding has been rising sharply over the past couple of years which has now been followed by a rising term premiumHowever todays dynamic is unusual as historically the term premium behaved in the opposite way than we would expect  higher debt loads coincided with a falling term premium and viceversa This is likely because higher debt loads have been associated with recessions and during recessions inflation falls giving investors more confidence in buying longerdated bonds while at the same time investors also seek safety in higherquality assets boosting demand for TreasuriesRather the historically downtrending term premium appeared to be driven by a stronger level of inflation anchoring due to increased Fed credibility and transparency A subdued level of inflation volatility until recently has also helped as well as strong buying of US Treasuries by foreigners particularly foreign central banks given an increase in global FX reservesForeign holdings as a share of Americas national debt have now been on the decline falling to around 27 while commercial banks have been sellers as well BTFP has mitigated this somewhat and the Fed itself is allowing Treasuries to roll off its balance sheetInflation volatility has jumped sharply though it appears to be slowing down once again Feds credibility has been dinged however longterm inflation expectations remain low suggesting that inflation remains well anchored across markets and the sharp hawkish turn by the Fed has helped shore up its inflationfighting credentialsOverall the term premium will likely remain elevated and higher than what we saw in the decade preceding COVID however two of the three pillars remain mostly in place which suggests that the term premium is unlikely to move back to the top of its multidecade rangeThe most direct impact of an elevated term premium on BDCs is through their cost of debt Many BDCs were able to refinance their fixedrate bonds in 2021 at what now look like incredibly low levels This was because both Treasury yields and credit spreads were both very low in 2021For example BXSL issued 5 bonds in just over 14 months starting in July 2020 at coupons that are miles below todays Treasury yields locking in an amazing net interest margin for yearsOne of these bonds already rolled off in July and others will follow in subsequent years Unless rates collapse from here this means that many BDCs will be refinancing bonds with coupons of 23 to bonds with coupons of 65 in effect more than doubling their cost of funding on each issueSome BDCs like BXSL have longerterm debt ,30,2023-10-20,0,0.992,-0.11111110493827195

261,261,SPY: You Have Been Warned By Jerome Powell,The notion that history doesnt repeat itself but rhymes in the stock market encapsulates the idea that while each financial eraTypically stocks and treasury yields interest rates are inversely proportional As riskfree interest rates rise equitiesHowever as soon as longduration 10year treasury yields broke past previous cycle highs at 425 the SP500 formed a local top in midJuly and has since declined by nearly 8 with 10year treasury yields soaring to new cycle highs of 5001 last weekNow the rally off of October 2022 lows has been characterized by extremely poor breadth with nearly all of the equity market returns from the last twelve months being generated by a select few megacap tech companies that carry heavy weighting in major market indicesInterestingly the rally in big tech has been driven by significant PE multiple expansion and not fundamental earnings growth Given the steep rise in longduration treasury yields such a multiple expansion goes against common sense and financial logic The only reasonable explanation is that investors are piling into big tech names due to their safehaven status massive free cash flow generation and robust balance sheets as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to pile up in the economy In one of my recent notes I shared my views on the significant concentration into bigcap tech and its risks to the Nasdaq100 Now from a historical standpoint I am seeing a lot of parallels between 2023 and 1987  the year of the Black Monday crash In a similar vein to 2023 we can observe a sharp rise in equities and longduration treasury yields through the summer of 1987 an anomalous breakdown of the stock and bond yield relationship And as you can see on the chart below the rally of 1987 ended with a violent crash in the stock market on Black Monday 19th October 1987 with investors fleeing into treasury bonds in a flight to safety trade causing a sharp decline in treasury yieldsIn todays note we will try to find an answer to this question but before we do that lets understand the drivers of this ongoing wild runup in longduration treasury yieldsOn the back of a 40year bull run in the bond market 19822022 treasury yields have spiked up over the last eighteen months as the Fed has tightened its monetary policy to combat the pandemicinduced inflation ending the era of free moneyDuring this tightening cycle the Fed has already raised the Federal Funds rate from 0 to 55 and reduced its balance sheet assets by 1T through runoff of treasury and mortgage securities at the rate of 95B per monthWhile inflation has moderated rapidly since peaking out in 2022 it is still running well above the  target of 2 September CPI 37 yy With persistent labor market tightness unemployment rate 38 and strong economic data central bankers refuse to declare victory in its war on inflation and rightly so given past inflationary episodesFor several months the Fed has insisted that a higher rates for longer policy will be kept in place until the inflation genie is put back into the bottle And in his recent address on monetary policy at the New York Economic Club Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open to more rate hikes despite strong indication of a pause in the hike cycle due to tightening of financial conditions caused by the ongoing surge in long duration treasury yieldsNow as we know the  monetary tightening actions and higher interest rates for longer stance explain the move higher in shortduration treasury yields However longduration treasury bonds have absolutely collapsed in recent monthsAmid a bear steepening longterm interest rates outpacing shortterm interest rates the US treasury yield curve has been uninverting rapidly And as of writing the spread between 10year and 2year treasury yields has narrowed down to just 16 bps from more than 100bps just a few weeks agoHistorical,62,2023-10-23,0,0.9896,-0.6666666296296316

263,263,RTX Corp.: I'm So Bullish It Hurts,On October 12 I wrote an  titled  In that article I discussed my move to buy more Northrop Grumman  stocks and my dedication to overweightSince last week four of my top five holdings are defense companies accounting for 268 of my total portfolio In other words I did put my money where my mouth isOne of my largest defense holdings is the  formerly known as Raytheon Technologies which is the result of a 2020 merger between United Technologies and RaytheonThe company was one of the first holdings of my new dividend portfolio I used the pandemic to aggressively buy this aerospace stock After all its my only defense holding with significant commercial exposure Roughly half ofThis year I was able to step things up as the market presented us with terrific buying opportunitiesWhile I am writing this RTX shares are down 27 yeartodate trading 30 below their alltime highThis is an abysmal performance The SP 500 is up 128 yeartodateAfter shares peaked in 2022 due to slower global growth expectations in general the real trouble started when the company announced its 2Q23 earningsWhile the earnings were strong showing a significant rebound in commercial demand and higher defense orders the company announced that it had found major issues in its commercial engine segment run by its Pratt  Whitney segmentThat was also when I decided to use this opportunity to throw more cash at a company that I believe will turn into one of my biggest longterm winners Both from a total return and dividend growth perspectiveSince then the stock has lost another 15 as RTX has made everything public In a special investor call it explained the cost it would have to deal with and why this would ruin its initial outlookThe good news is that the problems arent likely to impact the companys longterm growth outlook or any of its relationships with Airbus and BoeingWhile I cannot sugarcoat what has happened this article aims to explain why I believe that RTX provides significant longterm value for dividend growth investorsWhenever I write articles that involve major issues at companies that are very important to my portfolio I can honestly say that I am not biased I know that defending poor choices will only cost me money in the long termThe good thing is that Im convinced that aggressively adding to RTX was one of the smartest moves I made this yearThat said in the aforementioned Northrop article I was asked how I would rank the largest defense contractors in the United States Please note that I had to add Lockheed Martin  manually to the screenshot as I forgot to include it in my original answerAlso I want to quickly use this opportunity to thank all of my frequent readers and commenters for providing so much food for thought for myself and everyone engaging in interesting discussionsMy decision to put RTX so high is based on two thingsEssentially RTX needs to recall some of its key products resulting in a massive shortterm financial impactOn July 25 during its earnings call the company mentioned that due to rare conditions in powdered metal it had to accelerate maintenance for some of its commercial enginesLess than two months later on September 11 the company held a special call to put all findings on the table explaining to investors what was going on so investors and analysts knew what was going onCEO Gregory Hayes addressed the root cause of the issue describing it as a manufacturing escape involving contaminated powdered metal He explained that a contaminant made it into the powder during a capacity rampup in late 2015 The issue was due to microscopic elements that inspection techniques couldnt detectTheyve since introduced an angle scan inspection to identify these anomalies and have made process changes to ensure powder purityThe company estimates a potential expenditure of up to 7 billion for engine repairs and compensations to airlines This comes as over 60,82,2023-10-16,0,0.996,0.0
264,264,"InMode: Overblown Reaction On Guidance, A Rare Valuation",InMode  and its stock first came to my attention just a few days ago when I refreshed my Seeking Alpha key High Quality and Bad Momentum stock screener I began to investigate further In the analysis I willIn the past the company was significantly overvalued but that has changed dramatically and I now view it as an excellent bargain for the reasons I will explain later However based on the companys balance sheet I determined that the companys margin of safety is substantial as the Cash and Shortterm investments minus total liabilities calculated per share is close to 7 Compare it to the stock price of 20 this will help you evaluate the situation in which in my opinion Mr Market is wrongThere is a great deal of negative fundamentals which is aggressively dragging the stock price down However I will attempt to determine whether it was caused by psychology or actual events As a future shareholder I view the current events as a phenomenal investment opportunity because as I will reveal in the valuation section the company is facing headwinds but the price has been cut by more than 30 percent in recent weeks In terms of valuation it begins to be truly safe near this point as the margin of safety increases significantly in my viewHowever one of the primary drivers of the most recent price decline is the companys  as reported here on SAAccording to management there are solid  for this including the companys return to normal seasonality in Q3 and economic slowdown as well as the companys observation of a decrease in summertime purchase decisions Additional reasons cited here wereIn conclusion there is a decline of 85 from the highest old estimate to the lowest current estimate but still a substantial margin In a short period of time revenue forecasts for the current subsequent and two fiscal years out have dropped significantly and this trend may continue However despite this decline Forward PE is still very attractiveThe margin is still quite high and in the event of further demand concerns a typical easing in cyclical sectors could occur Nevertheless this is a cyclical point To find out more about the macroeconomic outlook you should read my most recent analysis  I believe the company is on the right track based on its history and the industrys continued growthAs INMD is an Israelbased company the entire stock market experienced a significant selloff led by the stock index TA 35 which fell by more than 10 in the first trading days following Hamass multipronged attack on Israel The Israeli prime minister also declared war Uncertain as to how this will impact the economy as a whole there is a possibility of a consumer shock manifested by decreased consumption retail sales investments and migration From this point forward there may be a significant impact on the Israel business unit Furthermore it is a new geopolitical risk that could result in even more aggressive global tightening if the price of oil reacts by increasingHowever below I provide the companys geographical revenue breakdown from its  filings which indicates that 66 of sales are made in the United States 11 in Europe and 23 internationally My subjective point was that only a fraction of total sales are in Israel perhaps 15 Later the company his up laterIn the initial reaction the stock price fell 6 on the first trading day and then more than 25 after reduced guidance however the company is getting closer to pure value as I term it Currently the stock price is fluctuating near 20 accompanied by a pervasive negative sentimentWhere I see potential risk from the conflict is not in Israel sales but rather in the form of additional pressures on energy prices which could lead to an increase in CPI and potentially a prolonged tightening in tandem with a decline in consumption Many individuals may become more cautious and prefer to delay certain consumpt,17,2023-10-26,0,0.9104,-0.679999972800001

277,277,What Affects The Price Of Gold: Conventional Wisdom Vs. History,People buy gold and silver for a lot of reasons For jewelry and adornment for numismatic coin collecting purposes to store wealth limited industrial applications to protect against inflation and to guard against geopolitical turmoil and related threats to fiat governmentissued currency As it relates to investing the list is narrowed theFirst it must be stated and underscored that there is nothing special about gold that makes it magically go up in value in response to inflation Gold is a commodity and like any other commodity its price rises and falls according to supply and demand dynamics with plenty of interference from gold futures speculation In other words the price of gold only goes up if people are willing to pay more for it And as inputs commodities tend to be the first to feel inflations powerBecause it has been repeated so often that gold protects purchasing power from the ravages of inflation it could be a classic instance of the tail wagging the dog When people hear that inflation is high or going to be high they flock to gold to protect their purchasing power thus driving the price of gold up That increase in price then makes it look like gold did indeed track with inflation but it wasnt the inflation that caused it It was people buying gold due to inflationary fears Its correlation but not causation There have been  where gold went down in spite of inflationIn other words trying to time the market and get in and get out of gold according to inflation reads and inflation expectations could result in considerable money lossHowever using gold as a store of value over extremely long periods of time could indeed achieve the desired result This chart explains it allWith notable periods of divergence gold and to a lesser extent silver have both kept pace with inflation But the problem with this is that we have instruments that allow us to  pace inflation with zero periods of divergence TIPS and Ibonds So gold and silver become lesser vehicles if matching inflation is the stated goal Another issue is that tracking with inflation via gold silver TIPS or Ibonds means that the real return is still 0 Purchasing power was maintained but wealth did not increase If you can use an asset that BEATS inflation why not use itGold and silver are nonproductive assets More than perhaps any other asset class the value of these is inherently tied to how much someone else is willing to pay for it Beyond limited use in industry and electronics gold is just a mineral Unlike stocks which represent proportional ownership of an entity that produces and can produce more of things that humans use need want and demand or real estate that serves a critical function to giving people a place to live work eat etc gold just sits there As Warren Buffett said sure you can fondle gold but dont expect it to respondIn summation for this portion yes precious metals can protect against inflation but only if they are held for the long term But maintaining purchasing power is a far lesser goal than actually building wealth so if you have to hold something for the long term anyway you might as well buy stocks or real estate whose returns smash gold and silverI am of the opinion that investing in precious metals for the inflation aspect alone simply isnt worth it If you want to match inflation buy TIPS or Ibonds Better yet beat inflation by investing in stocks and real estate for the long term However when coupled with a second factor allocating a modest portion of ones overall portfolio to precious metals makes senseLet me put it bluntly if something like World War III starts up and the United States loses our currency will almost certainly collapse With the Russian invasion of Ukraine the hot situation in Israel and Chinas objective of someday retaking Taiwan plenty of folks are prognosticating about an outbreak of widespread war involving major powers If ,24,2023-10-26,0,0.9913,-0.5714285306122479

284,284,ZIM Integrated: The Dividend Lesson (Rating Upgrade),The thesis of this article is twofold and both are relatively straightforward First I want to summarize the lessons Ive learned from   as a dividend investor Second I wantIn the early part of 2023 I wrote  to caution readers against ZIM During that time the overall sentiment on ZIM was bullish and my view was considered contrarian One of the key reasons for the bullish view was the dividend yield more than 100 at that time Of course even the bulls wont expect such dividends to last Therefore the gist of the bullish argument was that the dividend can last long enough to compensate for the risksMy view was simply that it wouldnt be because of the strong headwinds in shipping rates and volume Indeed the company kept bleeding cash The dividend cut came sooner and deeper than expected ZIM investors suffered large total losses see the chart belowLooking forward the picture is still gloomy I do not expect the company to earn a profit in the next 12 years either in terms of accounting EPS or free cash flow As such I do not think there will be dividends either in the next 12 years and ZIMs dividend guidance iswas to pay out 3050 of its net income annually Global shipping rates and volume are still near a cyclical bottom see the next two charts and I anticipate the situation to persist longer given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties eg high inflation and the possibility of a recession and geopolitical conflicts eg the RussianUkraine war and the IsraelHamas conflictHowever as to be elaborated on next I do see a few positive signs in development At the same time I believe the stocks current valuation about 022x of its tangible book value has also priced in all the negatives As seen from the chart below inventory level has recovered strongly in the recent six months across all major shipping categories manufacturing retail trade and wholesalers In the meantime the global shipping volume this year the orange line in the right panel has also recovered substantially from the bottom level compared to 2020 the dark red line By eyeballing the data in the first half of 2023 the global volume has recovered to be about the average in the past five years between 2019 and 2023A full recovery could take longer due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks I just mentioned However if the shipping market does recover I see ZIM as wellpositioned to benefit because of several differentiating features in its business model The top differentiators in my view are its focus on a global niche strategy its relatively young and agile fleet and its use of digital technologiesZIM operates in several selected trade routes in which it has a sizable market share I expect such focusing on a niche to enable ZIM to offer more competitive rates and services to its customers once the overall climate changes ZIM also has a relatively young and flexible fleet which allows it to adapt quickly to changing market conditions such as routes and operation schedules as needed Finally in this mature sector ZIM is a player that emphasizes the role of new technologies more than the average in the way I see things It uses digital solutions to improve its efficiency and customer service such as booking and trackingThe picture is not all rosy and ZIM is not out of the wood entirely There are a few key risks associated with ZIM Some of these risks are common to the shipping sector and some of them are more unique to ZIM The common risks include the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks mentioned above Other key common risks include environmental regulations and government policies Shipping companies who operate a global fleet have to navigate apologies for the pun a web of environmental regulations and government policies from different regionscountries A change in these regulations for example new regulations on emissions or export control could increase their costs or d,1,2023-10-24,0,0.6851,-0.3333333111111126

291,291,SP500: Five Days Later - I'm Short Again (Technical Analysis),Just last week I  the on SP 500  and went tactically neutral Specifically I closed the naked short call position on SP 500 futures My strategy at the time was to evaluate the potential for the endoftheyear rally or to reshort the key breakdown below the 4200 level But this is what happened over the last 5 days  the SP 500 spiked by about 200 points Here is a 1month chartOn a 5year chart the SP 500 touched the key support at the 200dma level and bounced strongly to the 100dma resistance red line More importantly the 50dma green line is at the same level and crossing the 100dma  this isSo I covered the short position at the 200dma support since I did not anticipate an imminent breakdown In my playbook the trigger for the 200dma breakdown would have to be something major such as an imminent recession Given the strong labor market I do not see an imminent recession yetRecently the Fed officials have been talking dovishly suggesting that the Fed could be done with increasing the interest rates  and the Federal Funds futures have priced the Fed pause accordingly The fact that the US economy is still growing strongly and that the Fed seems to want to pause the interest rate hikes increases the probability of the endofthe year rallyThus tactically it seemed appropriate to cover the short position especially the out of money naked call optionSo the bounce happened quickly just like the bear market rallies are  quick and sharp And the bounce stopped at the key resistance Thus rather than waiting for the 200dma breakdown I reshorted at the resistance Again my choice was to short the Dec call option 4400 expiration which actually was the in the money option at the time of the transactionEssentially this call option doubled from around 50 to around 100 over the last 5 days Thus when priced at 100 the option has the breakeven point at SPX 4500 So my new bet is that SP500 will close below the 4400 level for full profit while at the 4500 level the trade is breakevenThis is not a bet that the SP500 will crash its more of a bet that it will not go much higher from these levels This is appropriate for now until SP 500 revisits the 200dma resistance and the 4200 level at which point the probability of crash increases  if the support is broken accompanied by a fundamental triggerFirst of all what caused the selloff in the SP 500  from late July The July selloff was triggered by the decision by the BOJ to allow JGB yields to increase to 1  the tweak in BOJ monetary policy This triggered the trend of higher 10Y yields due to the fears that Japanese investors would start selling US Treasuries Since then there were several events that contributed to the rising US longterm interest rates Most importantly the US Treasury increased the size of bond offering due to the rising US fiscal deficit  and the auctions were weak which supported the theme that the foreign demand for US Treasuries is waning Thus the higher supply of Treasuries has been met with a lower demand  and thats been causing the increase in the real yieldsThe increase in real yields is not good for the overvalued stock market and thus as the 10Y yields continued to rise the stock market continued to fall mainly due to PE valuation contractionSo what caused the bounceAfter the blowout labor market report last Friday the bond market initially sold off which is a normal reaction  a tight labor market might require higher for longer interest rates to bring inflation down to 2However the bond market is notoriously famous to reverse on the laborreportFriday so it reversed last Friday possibly as some traders took profit on the short bond positionsBut then over the weekend a horrible attack on Israel happened which caused some flight to safety to Treasury Bonds and the 10Y Treasury Bond futures continued rising lower interest ratesHere is the chart of Dec 10Y,123,2023-10-23,0,0.9903,-0.6923076390532585
292,292,Buy Alert: Why I Just Massively Increased My Gold Position,While I focus mostly on high yield investments like MLPs  REITs  BDCs  renewable energy Yield Cos alternative asset managers and utilities  I have recently been massively increasingMoreover even if China does not invade Taiwan for many years to come if ever we still believe the outlook for gold is quite bullish In this article we will discuss these reasonsHayman Capital Management founder and CIO Kyle Bass  who is also a China expert  recently that Communist China is likely to invade Taiwan by the end of 2024 He believes that the markets have not even closely priced in this risk because they believe that the economic cost of such an attack is sufficient to deter CCP leader Xi Jinping from launching such an attack However such calculus assumes that Xi is a rational actor that is motivated by economic factors In reality the CCP has shown repeatedly that it is far more concerned with maximizing its domestic and international power than in maximizing its GDPAs Bass pointed outUnfortunately however unlike Putins war in Ukraine if Xi were to invade Taiwan it would have devastating consequences for the global economy and could very possibly bring on world war 3Why is China increasingly likely to invade Taiwan sooner rather than later There are four main reasonsSo why is gold a good hedge against a Chinese invasion of TaiwanFirst and foremost gold would almost certainly outperform the broader stock market  in such a scenario especially if the United States and Japan joined the fight in some capacity I view the US and Japan joining the fight as being very likely given that the CCP would likely want to launch a preemptive devastating attack against US naval and air forces in the region stationed in Japan and Guam in order to delay the USs ability to intervene militarily on behalf of Taiwan and potentially inflict such heavy and sudden losses that the American public may shirk back from entering an allout war with China If China struck US forces on Japanese soil the Japanese would inevitably suffer some collateral damage and would be very motivated to join the war alongside their American alliesThe reason that this scenario playing out would hurt the stock market so much is that the US China and Japan are the worlds three largest economies by GDP and are also the worlds three largest economies by amount of global trade they participate in On top of that Taiwan is the worlds main production center of semiconductor chips Last but not least some of the largest companies in the world are headquartered in the United States and are heavily reliant on China and Taiwan for producing and selling their products Tesla  and Apple  come immediately to mind as examples These businesses and thousands more like them in China Japan the United States and around the world would immediately suffer massive impairments in the event of a war over Taiwan In fact some  put the immediate destruction to the global economy at 26 trillion with the Rand Corporation predicting a global depression and a decline in US GDP of at least 5 which is twice the decline experienced during the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisisMoreover confidence in the US Dollar could take a major hit especially if its military suffers major losses This is because  even if it prevails eventually over the Chinese military which is far from guaranteed in the conflict  its ability to project power around the world and secure international trade will likely be significantly impaired from the heavy losses it will inevitably incur in such a warMeanwhile gold  a proven safe haven during periods of economic distress and geopolitical uncertainty  would likely catch a very strong bid during such a crisis Moreover central bankers would likely be forced to slash interest rates in an attempt to calm markets and prop up faltering economies not to mention reduce the financing cost of fina,241,2023-09-19,0,-0.9898,-0.7857142576530622
293,293,SQM: A Roughly 30% Geopolitical Discount Compared With Albemarle, Chiles government managed to send shockwaves recently through the global lithium mining sector by announcing its presidents aim to nationalize Chiles lithium mining sector Since then Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA  saw itsFor the  of this year net profits declined slightly from 796 million in Q1 2022 to 750 million Revenues increased by 12 for the same period which signals a significant deterioration in profit margins In Q1 2022 the profitstorevenue ratio was over 39 while for the latest quarter it was 33 It is still a healthy profit margin but it went in the wrong directionIt seems that one aspect of the worsening profit margin performance had to do with the weakening price of lithium sold which came on top of declining salesAs is the case with most currently established lithium producers SQM is in production expansion mode given the ongoing steep increase in global demand mostly driven by the EV sales growth trendIt should be noted that while most of SQMs lithium output came from Chile in 2022 as we can see by 2025 as much as 21 of its lithium production will come from outside of Chile It should be noted that by 2030 SQM is supposed to enter into some sort of partnership with the Chilean government under current proposals where supposedly it might lose partownership of those mines If the current trend of SQM branching out its operations outside of Chile continues any such nationalization might have less of an impact on its operations than it is currently assumedIt should be noted that Albemarle is projecting higher production  sales growth rates in its lithium segment compared with SQMAs we can see Albemarle expects to see lithium sales growth double in the 20222025 period while SQM expects its production growth to rise by slightly less than 50 in the same period If there is one viable argument to point to as a reason to have a higher PE ratio for Albemarle it is this higher rate of growthGiven the changing global economic  geopolitical environment most investments should trade at a steeper discount due to the heightened global risk environment in my view SQM  Albemarle in particular are on risk watch because Chiles president announced plans to  the countrys massive lithium mining sector a few months ago It should be noted that the plan potentially affects SQM in 2030 while Albemarle is in a more favorable position for its turn would only come in 2043 and less than half of its production comes from its Chile operationsThe plan vaguely calls for partgovernment ownership not full nationalization with the details yet to be hammered out at the negotiating table Furthermore it is more than likely that the Chilean government would be obliged to pay for any shares it would take over therefore we are not necessarily talking about outright expropriationIt should also be noted that between now and 2030 a lot can still happen in Chilean politics Things could get worse for lithium producers with political forces that favor nationalization potentially gaining ground But things could also go the other way with political winds shifting in a potentially more probusiness direction There are some obvious downsides to the plan including the fact that both SQM and Albemarle are now more likely to invest elsewhere in response to the plan Chiles political elites might consider that it is not worth it for them to continue with this plan which might do more harm to Chile than the benefit it might potentially bringSince the Chilean plans for nationalization were unveiled Albemarles stock price fared much better than SQMs stock priceIt should be noted that once we factor in the dividend that SQM pays even though its stock underperformed so far this year the net result of holding this stock hypothetically from the start of the year has been more beneficial to investorsAs for whether there may be a buying opportunity in the next few months I believe tha,14,2023-10-13,0,0.9746,-0.46666663555555765
