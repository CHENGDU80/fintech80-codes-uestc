0,0,Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,At the close of 2021 a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up in the 2020s decade setting the stage for what she callsStill in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape and shape fortunes throughout thisRegarding the longterm future of the energy sector my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the RussiaUkraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today In my opinion these companies as well as their investors would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020sIn the following sections I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil while also exploring how this affects one of the worlds largest and most vertically integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil Corporation After the forced breakup of Standard Oil an American oil behemoth Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world and produces a large amount of the worlds energy  in 2018 It is vertically integrated and therefore controls the upstream exploration drilling extraction midstream transportation storage refining and downstream retail sales and distribution handling of oil and natural gas While it may not be the worlds largest oil company a title usually held by stateowned Saudi Aramco Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry making it significantly appealing to investorsAs formidable a company as it may be the oil giants past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that timeRevenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the 350400 billion range but declined to the 200250 billion range from 2015 to 2019 Revenues for 2020 were disastrous with the company pulling in only 178 billion that year However 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over 275 billion and in 2022 the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil revenues of Exxon increased to nearly 400 billion since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supplyRegarding net income the trends are about the same with different numbers 32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 1520 billion range from 20152019 with a notable drop to 8 billion in 2016 a disastrous decline to a loss of 22 billion in 2020 a return to form of 22 billion earned in 2021 and a sharp rise to 55 billion earned in 2022Lastly cash flow from operations tells a similar story 45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014 a decline to the 2030 billion range for 20152019 a decline to 14 billion in 2020 and a rise to 48 billion and 67 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectivelyNotwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances Exxons performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry A misstep like neglecting shale shouldnt have been catastrophic for the company in any case considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industrys operations This means however that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse theres a good chance Exxon would follow as its oilbased revenue streams unraveledAs the stock of a wellknown giant in the energy sector I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time,1306,2023-08-14,6,0.7537,-0.35999998560000057

3,3,Exxon Mobil: OPEC+ Is Coming To The Rescue (Rating Upgrade),Exxon Mobil  experienced a sharp dropoff in free cash flow in the second fiscal quarter which is related to the decline in price realizations in end markets Exxon Mobil still generated a solid 5B in free cash flow in theI previously rated Exxon Mobil a sell    since the companys free cash flow likely peaked in FYMajor OPEC countries Saudi Arabia and Russia recently decided to put into action major supply cuts that would see the combined output volume to be reduced by 13M barrels per day until the end of the year Saudi Arabia  that it will reduce its oil production by 1M barrels a day while Russia  that it will also cut its exports by 300 thousand barrels a day The decline in output has reinvigorated fears over energy supplies especially ahead of a new winter season Oil prices have soared on the back of such news climbing back to 90 a barrel which significantly improves the earnings and free cash flow prospects of large energy producers like Exxon MobilExxon Mobil experienced a rather significant dropoff in free cash flow in the second fiscal quarter which has been the result of lower average prices in end markets Exxon Mobils average crude oil price in the US declined 34 year over year to 7137 a barrel while natural gas prices experienced a much sharper drop of 78 year over year to 145 per kcf The second fiscal quarter was also the fourth straight quarter of declining average prices in Exxon Mobils US segment and the third straight quarter of negative growth in the natural gas businessThe deterioration in the pricing environment in the last year has led to a significant dropoff in Exxon Mobils free cash flow The company generated 50B in free cash flow in Q223 which was down sharply from the 22B free cash flow level which was recorded in the third fiscal quarter of FY 2022 But with OPECs recent supply cuts and rapidly rising petroleum prices Exxon Mobil has actually significantly improved earnings and free cash flow prospectsSource AuthorThe biggest competitor for Exxon Mobil in the US is Chevron  and both companies trade at moderate pricetoearnings ratios Exxon Mobil is currently projected to see a 35 dropoff in earnings per share in FY 2023 largely due to lower average prices With price trends reversing lately however Exxon Mobil may see new EPS upward revisions Currently Exxon Mobils shares are valued at 132X FY 2024 earnings compared to PE ratio of 117X for Chevron While I dont believe that Exxon Mobil is a bargain at 132X forward earnings I acknowledge that OPECs supply decisions could have a material impact on Exxon Mobils profit situationThe biggest risk for Exxon Mobil obviously is a decline in average prices for petroleum and natural gas products because the production business accounts for the majority of the firms earnings and free cash flow With declining market prices come weaker profit margins and lower free cash flow however so if the market doesnt trust OPECs output decisions energy prices may declineAlthough Exxon Mobil saw a significant decline in its free cash flow in the second quarter the energy company still reported solid profitability and OPEC looks to come to the rescue of major energy producers Fears over additional or longerlasting supply cuts ahead of the winter season have resulted in oil prices soaring back above 90 a barrel which should provide a decent profit and free cash flow boost to Exxon Mobil in the third quarter While I dont believe that shares of Exxon Mobil are especially cheap with a PE ratio of 132X I believe the change in energy market fundamentals justifies a rating upgrade to hold   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker,40,2023-09-17,1,0.9968,-0.5555555246913597
4,4,Why I Believe $200 Oil Could Be In The Cards,Oil traders and analysts seem to underestimate the IsraelHamas war and its consequences for the worlds economy Indeed neither Israel nor the Gaza Strip have substantial oil reserves but there are not only two sides to the conflict The war is getting moreI have been bullish on oil for a while  on the subject wasThe map below was prepared by  The countries supporting Palestine in the conflict are marked in orange whilst the militias are marked with red dotsAs concerns Saudi Arabia initially wanted  with Israel However as  escalated between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas the SaudiIsrael deal went on ice Moreover Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a telephone call with Iran Israels opponent in the conflict to discuss the situation Simultaneously Saudi Arabia is calling both sides of the conflict to peace and is trying to find a solution In order to achieve this Saudi Arabia and the UAE met to discuss the war  Iran could be involved in the conflict This could affect the Gulf countries national security That is why they have been pressing Western allies and Israel to deescalate tensions in Gaza and lift a siege on the strip in my viewHere comes the biggest risk to the oil markets Iran  nations has shown strong support to Palestine It is highly likely to get involved in the conflict if the war intensifies Yes right now Iran is not having a war with Israel However Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein AmirAbdollahian  settlement of the situation in the Gaza Strip is becoming highly unlikely and warned Iran may take  against Israel The minister also added the country did not initially plan to engage in a military conflict with Israel if Tel Aviv did not strike Iranian territory At the same time Iran may  if Israel launches a ground operation in the Gaza Strip  the latter seems to be inevitableMoreover  with Hezbollah the military group located in Lebanon Hezbollah has vowed to escalate if Israel begins a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip which is likely and Israel said it would retaliate  The point I am making is that the situation in the Middle East might get more complicatedThe situation is not new The IsraelHamas conflict comes 50 years after the Yom Kippur War  the fourth of the ArabIsraeli wars was initiated by Egypt and Syria on 6 October 1973 on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur After that on  immediately after President Nixons request for Congress to make available 22 billion in financial help to Israel the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries OAPEC implemented an oil embargo on the US and started cutting their oil production This made the global oil prices surge nearly fourfold The prices rose from 290 a barrel before the embargo to 1165 a barrel in January 1974 In March 1974 amid disagreements within OAPEC on how long to continue the punishment the embargo was officially lifted The oil prices however still remained highI believe something similar might actually happen now Although I doubt OPEC may implement an oil embargo a potential war between Israel and Iran may lead to massive supply cuts As can be seen from the map above Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz also known as the Gulf The Gulf is used to transport oil coming from the Middle East most notably from countries like Saudi Arabia Iraq UAE and Qatar If there is a fullscale war Iran might well close the Strait of Hormuz for all ships Unfortunately there are limited options to bypass the Gulf Moreover the very fact that there is a war in one country in the Middle East can disrupt oil production in the neighboring countries Nowadays missiles are fired and infrastructure gets destroyed So there is a big risk as wellYou might be wondering why I say that such a high oil price is well possible But let us have a look at the history of oil prices in generalThe diagram below shows the oil prices adjusted for inflation If before the Yom Kippur War th,26,2023-10-24,2,-0.9978,-0.8620689357907263
5,5,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,This followup article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in US energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering 20072022 In this period the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet BCF of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas it is important to first reference some history Before that we want to lay out some relevant terminology Natural Gas not surprisingly is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature It is measured in cubic feet at sea level volume increases or decreases with pressure It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet MCFConveniently one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1036 million BTU one author has a friend who considers this one of the proofs of the existence of God and this makes certain calculations easier for example a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs After this removal the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumersFirst a little bit of simplified but instructive history Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers these phases have been 1 nuisance 2 luxury 3 necessity and 4 national security At first it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually flared In fact one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using noflare orders Natural gas began to be used in cities but this was largely city gas produced from coalIt dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks and pipelines started to make their way across the country All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions So far so goodThen the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and the FPC now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers The experts at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production There were various estimates most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by nowThis policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973 Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels fuels for power plants and in other applications As oil prices rose more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices In addition producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state intrastate gas was not price regulated leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those marketsA complex mess emerged  loved by lawyers and lobbyists but hated by the public Each interstate pipeline had curtailment proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand One point was widely agreed  natural gas could never be used under a boiler i,265,2023-10-09,6,0.9934,-0.6666666111111158
6,6,Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),Over most of the past year I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads I  my longterm bullish take on MarathonHowever as discussed more recently  Ive downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash  in the crack spread As such it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon considering its stock remains generally high However its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopoliticalrelated production cuts Overall investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum depending on how we calculate its forward valuationFor the most part refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly My longterm view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today That said the shortterm outlook has changed as volatility mounts raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022 However oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around 87 per barrel today Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil  Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped Marathon has retained much of its value but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income The crack spread is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs crude oil has crashed particularly for the gasoline spread See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profitLuckily Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of 32barrel to 19barrel today That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above All else being equal this 12barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of 1296 annualized 324B quarterly  have only changed marginally over this period Natural gas has also hardly changed so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathons refining marginsThe company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023 However this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathons current EBITDA See belowHistorically Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around 15 depending on changes in other operating costs Today that spread is below its typical range before COVID19 indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around 15B per quarter from its Midstream segment In comparison its refining margins can vary from negative  seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage Its refining segment EBITDA was 316B in Q2 and may be as low as 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant Combined with an expected 15B from Midstream I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at 142B given limited changes in commodity prices and volumesMarathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the  I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the ,13,2023-10-09,1,-0.9751,-0.6153845917159773
7,7,My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,Through September the economy remains solid but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead Currently with the funds rate at 55 and the core CPI at 41 the real funds rate is 14 ThatThe Fed can resume its finetuning operation later if the need arises but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go Ill agree that the bulk of the Feds work is done BUT I dont believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a lastminute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded The firstever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mixraising the odds of a government shutdown in midNovember While this situation wont affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that willThe political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics fiscal spending and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors rating agencies and voters Now to be fair the governments deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yieldsthe markets way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order And the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the governments outofcontrol spending the worse the situation will getIn an era of low inflation and zerolow interest rates Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10year Treasury yield now hovering around 49 With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road fiscal austerity would become a nearterm headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates However that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2 target so this growthinflationinterest rate issue isnt going to be so easy to solve However as I will explain later an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced beforeThe auto workers union is making in my opinion some outrageous demands They are asking for a 40 increase in wages over 4 years a 20 reduction in the workweek from 400 to 320 hours and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of allelectric vehicles The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands poisoned any goodfaith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainableAt the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rankandfile union members The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President Against this background it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly As it progresses the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparentWhile investors seem to be pricing a soft landing history is not on their side The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history and the market is still trying to absorb the impact This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by nearterm macro events As rates have spiked so too have longterm yieldsYield spreads also bear monitoring The spread or difference between 2year and 10year Treasury yields has been negative all year ie an inverted y,445,2023-10-21,3,-0.879,-0.5652173667296797

11,11,My View Of Wall Street: A Disturbing Macro Scene,It is no secret that many of theSpeaking of a challenge the Fed has been left with a nearimpossible task They are trying to come up with a solution that measures the right amount of restraint needed to bring inflation back was once believed to be a temporary issue beginning in 2021 but the inflation rate defied those forecasts and climbed until reaching a peak in March 2022 The Fed says it is determined to get it back to the 20 mark but it does not   some four years after inflation began to move higher Weve already seen the effects Higher prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services  gasoline food shelter cars hotel room rates and restaurantsThese price increases arent going away anytime soon It would be foolish to believe we wont see this issue having an impact well into next year and perhaps well beyond that The Feds goal is 2 but getting inflation back down to the 20 mark is not good enough  to counter some of the cumulative buildup from the longlasting runup in inflation The Fed will surely stay on course higher for longer but they are once again stuck I doubt the Fed can loosen the reins even after inflation hits its target as they will have to wait until this runup in inflation is reversedInflation spares no one It erodes the consumers purchasing power Unfortunately the ones hurt the most are those at the lower end of the income scale and those relying on a fixed income They cannot easily avoid rising food and energy prices and higher rent which consume a very large portion of their takehome pay The warnings were there Excessive and as it turned out all of the added unnecessary spending to right an economy that was already right may remain a problem that can haunt the MACRO scene for a whileI do not agree with some market pundits assessments that the economy is less interest ratesensitive than it has been in the past Their claim is relatively speaking interest rates are not high when compared to history They have a point but that argument stops there Weve seen how equities  reacted to any movement in the 10year treasury note Its been the speed of these increases that kills their argument If that isnt enough after years of zero interest rates the market will t but this adjustment period will take time There is also another unknown that not many are talking about We have a large contingent of money managers and investors who have never been invested in a stock market where interest rates are moving higher How they are reacting and how they will act when rates dont come down tomorrow is yet to be determinedSo as a result I think it is premature to predict a soft nonrecessionary landing and all systems go for a rousing BULL market With multiple headwinds building on the horizon a recession is more likely How mild it is remains unanswered However if the Fed loses its patience or overstays its welcome some believe they already have the downturn could be more protracted than some of the forecasters expect Ill note that the forecasters referred to in the last statement have dwindled to a scant fewWhat drives the US economy is Consumer spending which makes up nearly 70 of the GDP With the strong labor market good wage improvements and all the pandemic stimulus they could ever want consumers have danced their way through the Feds aggressive rate hikes and higher borrowing costs However there are a few reasons why we can expect things to change For starters the labor market is softening Second excess savings from the pandemic are swindling so consumers no longer have a cushion to support their spending Third with student loan payments set to resume on October 1 likely to subtract 04 from consumer spending in 24 and gas prices rising as oil prices move higher from 68bbl to 90bbl consumers should have less discretionary income to spend going forward There is a positive they do have a job and as l,262,2023-10-14,3,-0.955,-0.4999999791666675
12,12,The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector There has been a shift for the US from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer ThisWeve already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger  acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired There will be more similar opportunities in the future For now lets take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the US energy sectorIn the past 15 years US energy production has skyrocketed Since 2007 we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter We have increased naturalBut today  we dont hear much about this from politicians or in the media It may be that with todays political alignment the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations  and for other reasons the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that factThis article deals with the general effects of this development Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022 Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time periodThere has been a major decline in coal production but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources On a Quadrillion BTU basis the decline in coal production has been roughly 11458 while the increases in petroleum natural gas solar and wind production have been respectively 13969 17320 3504 and 1814 for a total net increase of 25149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly onefourth of our total annual energy consumption This has not been a demanddriven increase in production During these same 15 years the annual energy consumption in the US has stayed roughly equal actually declining slightly from 1009 Quads to 1003 Quads There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables But an equally important shift has been that the US is no longer an energy importer and in fact exports petroleum on a net basis natural gas and coalBack in 2007 the massive US oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which in turn was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices Heading into the Panic of 2008 oil prices briefly reached 145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach 200 a barrel When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day 200 a barrel means more than 700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates confidence in our economy and economic growthThere is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of choke chain on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which in turn produced a recession An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973 1979 1990 and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middleincome and other Americans who had to pay more money for gasolineWhile the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lowermiddleincome Americans especially hard Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spe,562,2023-09-17,6,0.8753,-0.5555555246913597
13,13,Rising Instability And Its Market Impacts,This piece revisits the current US fiscal debt and deficit system in light of the ongoing problems in the US bond market and explores some investment themes amid this very macro heavy environmentLong duration bonds have enduredIve been bearish on bonds for a number of years now see  from July 2019  from April 2020 and  from August 2020 but the nominal degree of this drawdown over the subsequent 34 years has been surprising even to meI think the main part of this drawdown is mostly done for the time being and TIPS are looking interesting here with their positive real yields but the overall fiscal picture remains highly problematicIn various fields of engineering such as control engineering or mechanical structural design the concept of  is very important and it means something quite specificA system is either stable unstable or marginal as shown by the pictures aboveA  system has a bounded output that reduces over time when given a bounded input It tends towards calmness If you hit a metal beam with a force for example the resulting vibrations in the beam will diminish in intensity over time If you have an electromagnet and sensor system trying to  by measuring the position of the ball and automatically varying the power of the magnet accordingly a stable system will be able to reduce the balls oscillations until it hovers motionless If you poke the ball with a small force it will oscillate a bit from the dislocation and then return to calmnessA  system has a bounded output that remains in motion when given a bounded input In other words the system might keep oscillating but the oscillations wont get worse It would be like if you poke a levitating metal ball and it just keeps oscillating but still able to levitate there The control system is keeping it in check but is unable to get it back to calmness Every time it applies a magnetic force it slightly overshoots and then when it pulls back on the magnetic force it slightly undershoots and so the ball keeps getting pushed around but not getting worseAn  system has an unbounded output when given a bounded input The oscillations will keep getting bigger like how if you push a child on a swing at the perfect time while she is already starting to travel in the direction of the prior push then you can apply a pattern of pushes that keeps her going higher and higher each time even though your push strength doesnt change The inputs are  into a larger and larger output oscillation This is how a singer can shatter a wine glass with her voice if applied to the glasss mechanical resonance frequency or how soldiers marching over a bridge can collapse the bridge if their unified footsteps match the bridges mechanical resonance frequencyWhen thinking about the financial system of a developed country like the United States our mental model generally views them as marginal systems a series of oscillations that stay within the same overall bounds Sometimes debt levels go up and sometimes we need to tighten our belts so that debt levels go down Sometimes the central bank tightens monetary policy and sometimes it loosens it The financial system in other words is thought of as being similar to how it was 20 or 40 years agoBut in reality most financial systems are  They have an unbounded output in the sense that sovereign debt as a  of GDP keeps growing over time Fortunately the frequency of these systems is very long so it takes decades for problematic levels of instability to build up to the point where the output gets out of controlWhen it does get out of control the system needs to be reset recapitalized or restructured in some way In other words sovereign bondholders lose purchasing power through nominal default or more commonly through inflation To use the control system analogy the oscillations get out of control the electromagnet drops the ball and it has to be picked back up and put back in with ,172,2023-10-18,8,0.9834,-0.26315788088642733

20,20,Exxon Mobil: Why The Pioneer Deal Is A Game-Changer (Rating Upgrade),Exxon Mobil  last week announced a major acquisition that is set to make a huge impact on the companys production business especially in the Permian a basin that is known for delivering strong production growth and high marginsI previously rated Exxon Mobil a hold due to OPEC members mainly Russia and Saudi Arabia supporting petroleumThe Pioneer acquisition comes at a time of rising prices as well as  related to the conflict in Gaza which could benefit petroleum and gas prices and also help Exxon Mobil achieve shortterm earnings and free cash flow gains Since I see the acquisition of Pioneer favorably I believe a rating upgrade to buy is justifiedExxon Mobil  last week to acquire Pioneer in a 60B allstock transaction Shareholders of Pioneer Resources are set to receive 23234 shares of Exxon Mobil for each Pioneer Resources share they own The acquisition terms imply a takeover price for Pioneer Resources of 253 pershare showing a 9 premium over the firms 30day volumeweighted average priceThe transaction is transformational in the sense that Exxon Mobil expects to rapidly increase its production in the Permian basin which is a key growth play for Exxon Mobil Following the transaction completing Exxon Mobil projects to double its output to 13M BOED The firm has said it expects the closing of the deal in the first half of FY 2024 Additionally the acquisition of Pioneer is set to add an additional 856000 net acres in the Midland Basin further boosting Exxon Mobils production outlook the firm said that it looks to achieve an annual production output of 2 MOEBD by FY 2027The deal comes at a time when Exxon Mobils production volume has dropped chiefly because of asset divestments So the acquisition of new productive assets in a highpotential growth basin like the Permian indicates that Exxon Mobil could see positive production growth going forward Exxon Mobils Permian and Guyana assets provided positive growth in terms of production in the secondquarterThe acquisition strengthens not only Exxon Mobils Permian footprint but its entire core production business which accounted for 57 of the firms yeartodate earnings The remaining earnings were distributed among Exxon Mobils Energy Chemical and Specialty Products businesses The secondlargest business after production was the firms Energy Products segment which earned 65B so far this year and made a 34 earnings contribution yeartodateThe business combination of Exxon Mobil and Pioneer is also set to drive cost synergies which are expected to amount to 20B which is additional money that could be returned to shareholders over time either through dividend growth or share buybacksExxon Mobil is expected to earn 941 pershare in FY 2023 implying a 33 decline in earnings compared to the yearearlier period The decline in estimates is largely driven by weaker petroleum and natural gas prices compared to the yearearlier period which have dropped significantly in the first six months of the yearExxon Mobil is currently valued at 120X FY 2024 earnings while Chevron  has an earnings multiplier factor of 112X ConocoPhillips  is trading at a slightly higher earnings multiplier 123X possibly because the firm is more dependent than its more diversified US energy rivals on market prices for petroleum ConocoPhillips does not own a refinery business ConocoPhillips is a speculative buy for investors that believe that we are heading for a higherforlonger oil price environment The biggest risk for Exxon Mobil from a commercial perspective is that petroleum and natural gas prices decline which would likely lead to significantly lower earnings free cash flow and margins especially in the production business which Exxon Mobil is now deliberately strengthening with the acquisition of PioneerI believe the 60B allstock deal between Exxon Mobil and Pioneer is a gamechanger for Exxon Mobil and transform,28,2023-10-16,1,0.9949,0.0

32,32,Occidental Petroleum: The Advantages Of Leverage,Occidental Petroleum  took full advantage of financial leverage through the acquisition of Anadarko At first this looked like an unmitigated disaster in fiscal year 2020 as oil prices went negative Then it looked absolutely brilliant as oil prices careened past 100Admittedly there is a race of technology advances and operational improvements as well as cost declines against the timeNow the company does not need quite as much in the future for that acquisition to come out ahead Technology appears to be on track to provide a considerable profitability boost in the future Management  the purchase of Carbon Engineering Ltd Occidental already has one of the largest secondary recovering operations in the United States in the Permian Basin As unconventional wells age a lot of carbon dioxide is going to be needed to produce more oil through secondary recovery Management is obviously already thinking about that and that acquisition should increase the value of the Anadarko acquisition even more because more oil will be recoveredFavorable commodity prices always help though Right now it would appear that prices as usual are not acting as predicted Instead they are acting better The more this happens during the early deleveraging process the more likely the company will be able to demonstrate to shareholders the advantages of the acquisitionA large acquisition often needs five to seven years for the full benefits to become apparent That can be disheartening to shareholders that want to see all the results yesterday But it could also mean a very competitive company in the future with competitive benefits that were not available before the mergerThe most obvious place of improvement is the well resultsThe  continues to at least and probably exceed escalating costs elsewhere in the upstream system This is the kind of progress that brings more acreage into Tier 1 territory than was initially assumed at the time of the merger It also makes the acquisition more valuable over timeInvestors often wonder why company results do not reflect this progress where they can see it The reason is that the established production still has the costs at the time of the well drilling Those costs do not disappear simply because the latest well is so much betterThat means that the reported results are a mixture of new and established production It takes time for enough wells drilled the new way so that there are enough of them to report lower costs and hence better profitability corporate wideHere is yet another basin where well performance is improving Elsewhere management mentions for example that wells are getting longer where that is needed or desirable There are some things going on that improve profitability and raise costsAs against that drilling is going faster than I ever thought possible and completion both speed and design advances also exceed my expectationsThe real unanswered question is if the company is gaining against the competition over time Management clearly has some firstrate results But then again they had that before the acquisition Now the question remains if management can translate these gains into superior profitability in the future above what is currently being reportedI personally think that they have a much better chance of demonstrating this in the D J Basin because Occidental is a far superior operator than Anadarko was Therefore the profitability improvement is likely to show itself in a place where Occidental really had no significant exposure before the mergerThe whole second quarter message appears to be that the benefits of the merger and the leverage will be margin expansion at various commodity prices throughout the business cycleA side issue is the upside potential as North America increases the ability to export natural gas to the world Management  that oil is about 51 of total production That would imply some upside potential as North American natur,68,2023-10-23,5,0.9988,0.4736841980609422

34,34,What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,First and foremost the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination This article is not about politics and it will not focus on whats right or wrong Instead we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent as of this writing are up 3 with WTI  trading above 85 and Brent above 87 Initially at the close of Friday WSJ published a report noting that the US is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high Soon after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel If you want to thoroughly review the events Some of you may wonder what does this have to do with oil Historically speaking geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions In this case Israel is not a major oil producer so whats the catch The catch in our view has to do with Irans potential involvement in this whole ordeal WSJ published a piece noting that Irans senior officials helped plan this attack months agoWhile the US has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on IranFor starters we need context to what we are writing In June  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market Since then IEA has confirmed via its figures that Irans oil production is close to 31 million bd Our supply  demand model assumes 33 million bd and official Iranian figures support that production is around 33 million bdPutting all of this together Iran is exporting close to 2 million bd Visible tanker exports account for 15 to 16 million bd while shadow exports account for 400k bdSince H2 2022 the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports As we wrote earlier in the year this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storageWith floating storage gone and crude exports back to 2 million bd 500 to 800k bd below the previous peak whats the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward Perhaps the US does nothing and leaves Iran as is but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view while the risk of a major loss is low we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months We think the average would fall from 2 million bd to 16 million bd In terms of visible tankers this means Irans crude exports would drop closer to 12 million bdWhile it wont be much of a decline it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into yearend and possibly well into H1 2024Looking at our latest supply  demand update we made a few important assumption changesIn essence global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by monthend And if the US starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports then our balance could surprise to the upside But with a deficit of 22 million bd the lack of production decline from Iran wont make that much of a difference eitherOn the other hand with no mega deal on the horizon between Israel and Saudi the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis wont be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least 110bbl With Brent trading at 87 we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a realityIn conclusion global oil inventories should accelerate downward But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession Fund flows will ebb and flow so oil prices wont skyrocket anytime soon Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception Until then we see prices grinding higher with frequent ,125,2023-08-02,2,-0.9951,-0.8571427959183717

40,40,Petrobras: A Return To Bearish Ground As History Comes Full Circle,Over the past few months I have been one of the few Seeking Alpha analysts who have  a bearish outlook on Petrobras   due to various sources of political risks However this pessimism hasMy initial pessimistic stance was primarily rooted in concerns about shareholder control and the potential impact of government decisions on Petrobras especially given the companys historical context Legislative changes such as the injunction that reduced government control over stateowned companies could have substantial implications Its worth noting that Petrobras current CEO is a former politician from the same party as Brazils current president LulaOne of the fundamental questions for theIn light of these factors my outlook remains cautiously pessimistic Its crucial to closely monitor future developments and their potential impacts on Petrobras and the broader oil industry Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of this scenario and observing how the situation unfolds in the coming years will be intriguing Brazils history with past leftwing governments especially during Dilma Rousseffs administration has led to longterm value erosion for PetrobrasWhile its still too early to make definitive predictions I believe its highly improbable that the company will thrive under a management that repeats the same mistakes as those made in the past which clearly had a detrimental impact on its valueThe significance of oil to the Brazilian economy is a topic that deserves careful consideration in my opinion The true nature of this resource is often misconstrued Oil has served as the primary energy source throughout the past century and continues to hold that position Despite the growing shift towards renewable energy sources oil remains indispensable and is unlikely to become obsolete shortlyHowever owing to Petrobras being a stateowned company there exists a misconception that the oil it extracts exclusively belongs to the state This misconception stems from a historical slogan in Brazil Such beliefs lead people to expect low gasoline prices complicating Petrobras management and government decisionmaking Society must grasp that while oil is indeed a valuable resource it is not the sole property of Brazil and international factors influence its priceOil and natural gas constitute the primary sources of revenue for the National Treasury and this trend is expected to continue for many years Oil plays an integral role in Brazils trade balance and its production is rising In 2022 426 billion of crude oil was shipped  13 of total Brazilian exports a share only one percentage point behind soybeans Exploring new areas like the Equatorial Basin is imperative to maintain high production levels Oil is critical in the economies of various nations globally including Russia where it remains vital even during conflictThe Brazilian government often fails to comprehend the economic significance of oil and tends to focus primarily on fuel pricerelated issues People need to recognize that oil is both lucrative and pivotal to the economy and they must understand its relevance in the context of the global economyPetrobras has delivered positive results thanks to effective management in recent years particularly during the presidencies of Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro This has proven advantageous not only for Petrobras shareholders but also for the Brazilian economyThe current government led by President Lula experienced some luck concerning the price of the oil barrel From January until July the price fell to approximately 70 to 73 per barrel enabling Petrobras to lower gasoline and diesel prices However starting in July prices increased again surpassing 90Fortunately once again the exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the US dollar declined offsetting one factor against the other Petrobras still operates with some delays in price adjustments but these favorable factors,47,2023-10-02,2,0.9571,-0.21739129489603065
41,41,Evolution Petroleum Is Going Conventional,  is a small company that has been very conservatively managed for as long as I can remember A no debt  has been a priority until a spate of acquisitions disappointed the market But the company listed weatherrelated and maintenancerelated issues that are part of the business Nothing listed in the earnings report accounts for the market reactionInstead the market should have concentrated on the rather generous dividend that is supported by an extremely strong balance sheet That 12 per share  provides a yield that most investors report on average for a full year return on investmentsEven in a disappointing quarter like the current one cash flow more than supports the dividend Note that accounts payable changes soaked up a lot of cash flow That is a timing issue rather than a permanent cash flow decline It does not as a rule represent a lessening ability to support that dividendBut this little operator has 11 million of cash and basically no longterm debt Not only does the dividend support the stock price longterm but the debt free balance sheet gives management considerable flexibility in the future to go after bargains as it has in the pastThe paydown of liabilities used about 7 million of cash flow in the current quarter That kind of thing will happen with small companies Even with that event which is likely a timing issue the company still reported a decent cash balanceFurthermore the cash flow reported for the fiscal year was a generous approximately 50 million This shows that the diversification program begun a few years ago is successful in lessening the dependence on the Denbury  joint venture Investors have to keep in mind that a small company like this will have lumpy cash flow because expenditures can be rather large for the small company going to be acquired by Exxon Mobil  the immediate future is filled with far more reliability than the Denbury bankruptcy was Exxon Mobil is a renowned operator with a far better reputation than Denbury ever had as a small operator let alone a small one that went bankrupt As management has noted several times Denbury was clearly cash constrained That will not be the case for Exxon MobilProbably the main danger of the Exxon Mobil acquisition is that this joint venture is considered a highcost secondary recovery operation Exxon Mobil is likely to review it for cost improvements and if none are available Exxon Mobil management has a long history of selling interests in highcost operators and reinvesting the cash in lowcost operations So this main source of a decent amount of cash flow may be facing a period of uncertaintyMuch of the conventional assumption is that Exxon Mobil wants the carbon dioxide business of Denbury Therefore that same thought process assumes the secondary recovery business will be sold at some point due to the high costs of the businessEvolution management announced a joint venture with Pedevco This is a conventional opportunity similar to the business run by Ring Energy  This will take the Evolution Petroleum management further into more traditional upstream business while continuing to diversify away from higher cost secondary recovery businessPedevco is a conservatively run company that was hurt badly by the events of fiscal year 2020 The reason was that the company had not finished transitioning to an operating mode from a concept company that was acquiring leases with the idea of developing them This is similar to the Ring Energy story I have covered many times except Ring Energy had more production going into fiscal year 2020That still did not stop fiscal year 2020 from setting a lot of companies back The market changed overnight from relatively friendly to demanding return of capital while becoming very hostile to production growth Since both companies Pedevco and Evolution are financially strong the change in the debt market requirements did not affect either that muchOn the other,63,2023-09-14,8,0.9917,-0.06666666222222252

51,51,Marathon Petroleum: Investing In The Fossil Fuel 'Supernova',The US oil and gas sector has faced significant volatility with littletono correlation to the SP 500 over most of the past three years The sharp rise in oil and gas prices in 2021 led by production cuts the year prior caused most inMarathon Petroleum has significantly outperformed the general energy ETF The crack spread has been abnormally high in recent years for various reasons It also rose rapidly over recent weeks due to refinery outages and a and diesel stockpiles Accordingly those two energy commodities have risen in value compared to crude oil which has also increased in recent weeks See belowThe gasoline spread has been generally elevated since the initial refinery issues in 2020 but has never returned to its preCOVID levels due to ongoing refinery capacity shortfalls The diesel spread was high last year due to the acute shortage of diesel fuel Although that spread declined considerably after it has begun to rise again due to signs that the deficit will likely returnIn my view the situation facing refining margins and profits on other downstream energy segments makes companies like Marathon particularly interesting today MPC is hovering around its peak value but trades at a lower forward PE of 69X indicating it could be discounted today Of course the downstream sector also faces economic technological and regulatory risks which could offset its significant pricing power and tremendous moat The company faces numerous complex factors however I believe its shortterm outlook is solid with decent potential over the coming years Of course the company will likely need to make more significant green energy transition investments in the long run Still those may never drive substantial profits for well over a decade Accordingly I expect MPC will benefit tremendously from the lack of investment in legacy oil and gas until thenMarathons earnings  to lower refining margins that quarter primarily driven by the low diesel crack spread In Q3 its earnings outlook is much stronger due to the recent spread improvement with both showing a strong upward trend However one of the companys major refinery plants will be  due to a recent fire pushing its capacity utilization down to 93 from 100 Of course this issue is a doubleedged sword because it contributes to the lack of available refining capacity pushing the crack spread higher Across the industry refinery capacity utilization is around 93 today a standard level but total capacity is still significantly depressed See belowThe decline in total refinery capacity is the primary reason for the increase in refining profits creating a chronic shortage of refined products due to a lack of production and high demand This was triggered by a large wave of refinery  Refinery shutdowns or production issues will likely continue to grow as no new refineries have  As the country looks to shift toward electric vehicles  due to the immense costs low projected lifespan of refining projects and increased regulatory burden outlookOne company is looking to build a  which will be completed in 2027 however it will not add much to total production 129 refineries I expect that project  and shortages The labor and materials shortage is a significant secondary issue limiting capacity expansion and utilization After that the sharp increase in interest rates limits these companies willingness to borrow money to expand and strongly encourages a return of invested capital This trend is evident in Marathon Petroleum which has slashed the CapEx budget despite high profits and substantially increased its cashflow returns See belowCash from financing are net cashflows from dividends stock buybacks debt repayments being negative and stock and debt sales being positive When compared to Enterprise Value 79B for MPC it gives us a true dividend yield for the company as a whole not just its equity That figure is cu,26,2023-10-24,5,0.9879,-0.3333333209876548

53,53,Petrobras: Why Lula Is Not A Threat,Going forward there are reasons to be optimistic about Petrobrass performance Back in December I published an on the company in which I noted that the political fears that were spreading at that time due to the election of Brazilian President Lula were mostly overblown as it was unlikely that the company would be fully nationalized or be forced to cut its dividends entirely As youll see shortly all of those fears havent materialized and only strengthened my bullish thesis especially after Petrobras managed to generate revenues along with earnings above the 2021 levels while its stock appreciated by 40 since the time my latest article was publishedAt the same time even though the dividend policy was changed last month it didnt really make Petrobrass stock a less attractive investment Under the new policy Petrobras is going to distribute 45 of its FCF as dividends to its shareholders down from 60 before This is not that big of a deal when compared to other oil and gas majors from the United States or EuropeOn top of that theres also a possibility that the oil prices will remain at the current levels as is likely to stick with its policy of cutting oil production so that the oil prices remain relatively high This would make it possible for Petrobras to continue to generate decent profits and reward its shareholders along the way Add to all of this the fact that international investors are becoming more about Brazils economy and accelerate the amount of foreign direct investments into the country and it becomes obvious that Petrobras has more than enough opportunities to try and exceed expectations in the current environmentTherefore by at 4 times its earnings and less than 1 times its sales Petrobrass stock remains a solid stock to own especially when we compare it to its American peers Lets not forget that   and   trade at over 10 times their earnings and the only major reason why Petrobras is not trading at those multiples is the markets fear that political risks could be too high for now However as Ive explained earlier so far the Lula administration hasnt posed any threat to the company and is unlikely to disrupt the businesss operations anytime soon Thats why as institutional investors become more optimistic about Brazils future Petrobrass shares have more room for growth as there are no major reasons to think why the company shouldnt trade at multiples similar to its American peersOn top of all of this even though the company is unlikely to generate the same returns that it generated in 2022 in the foreseeable future due to the normalization of the oil market and the stabilization of oil prices there are to believe that revenues and profits will be above the 2021 levels in the following years Add to all of this the fact that oil prices are likely to slightly rebound in Q3 and Q4 while UBS a 20 dividend yield potential for 2024 and it becomes obvious that Petrobrass additional 10 upside from the current levels is more than justifiedThe world is in disarray and its time to build a portfolio that will weather all the systemic shocks that will come your way  offers you exactly that No matter whether you are a beginner or a professional investor this service aims at giving you all the necessary tools and ideas to either build from scratch or expand your own portfolio to tackle the current unpredictability of the markets and minimize the downside that comes with volatility and uncertainty  for a  today and see if its worth it for you  Bohdan Kucheriavyi andor BlackSquare Capital isare not a financialinvestment advisor broker or dealer HesItsTheyre solely sharing personal experience and opinion therefore all strategies tips suggestions and recommendations shared are solely for informational purposes There are risks associated with investing in securities Investing in stocks bonds options exchangetraded funds mutual funds and money market f,148,2023-08-31,3,0.9728,-0.05882352595155729

55,55,EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc  is a closedend fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations master limited partnerships and other energy infrastructure companies This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most incomefocused investorsAs regular readers will likely recall we last discussed this fund in midSeptember although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17 2023 That was well before energy prices started to tick up in midJuly so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests We can actually see this by looking at the funds performance which has been substantially better than the broader SP 500 Index  since that article was publishedThe difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the SP 500 Index which provides a boost to its overall investment return When we consider this distribution investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 1226 over the past five months compared to 360 for investors in the SP 500 Index That is a pretty significant difference in results Fortunately there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward although perhaps not quite that strongThere have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article Most importantly the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss Therefore let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an incomefocused portfolio todayAccording to the funds  the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return This makes sense because this is a common equity fund which is immediately apparent in the fact that 9806 of the funds assets are invested in common equityAs I have pointed out in numerous previous articles common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle After all investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of timeIn the case of midstream companies and partnerships a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index  which primarily tracks midstream partnerships Here are the comparison figures for the past yearAs we can see the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 1193 but investors in the fund actually realized a 2131 gain on their investment This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments In many years the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this As such we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciationAs regular readers are no doubt well aware I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site As such most re,5,2023-10-10,7,0.9921,0.4999999750000012
56,56,Cautiously Bullish Oil,For the most part indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish  as they have been for much of this yearOn the term structure front both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports reduced production of Saudi heavysour crudes which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline and a number of other factors the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardationMeanwhile WTI calendar spreads represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole The EIAs historically noisy estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen Regardless the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at presentWe can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above as well as looking at refined product crack spreads As we can see below gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firmClearly the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand sideSuch dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline or to reduce runs thus reducing the amount of crude they consume This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market After all refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oilThus all else equal unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the 95100 area in the near future particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lowerThough as we have seen outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic with the DubaiBrent spread a proxy for AsiaChina oil demand continuing to trend lower overall and near parityWhile the various AfricaBrent crude oil differentials also remain strong This is an important relationship to track as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell offWhile the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September Indeed if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages the picture has now turned unfavourable as we are seeing far more builds than drawsIn terms of commercial inventory levels overall total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages as do diesel stocks The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present For me to once again become uber bullish though I remain cautiously bullish persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the normIn terms of the outlook for supply and demand consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4 though to a lesser extent prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024 Although such forecasts are fu,4,2023-10-23,1,-0.9944,-0.23076921301775286

66,66,Halliburton's Rise: Riding The OPEC Wave,When I penned  on Halliburton  the stock was navigating a challenging phase primarily attributed to declining commodity prices My core investment premise hinged on the belief that production cuts would carve out a more favorable environmentThe move is largely due to the favorable production cuts by OPEC to support oil prices in the face of a potential fall in consumption due to a global slowdownThe global energy narrative took a compelling twist as Saudi Arabia and Russia confirmed their decision to extend  cuts removing a consequentialThe cuts saw Brent crude prices surge past the 90abarrel thresholda point unseen since November 2022There is a strong argument that these factors along with a possible conflict in the Middle East will continue to drive prices higher which will support the multiyear bull thesis I laid out in the last article Heres what I expectAlong with the supportive macro environment for oil prices there are other key business driversWe saw these drivers play out in the last earnings report demonstrating that the firm has been collecting its fair share of winsHalliburtons financial snapshot for 2023s second quarter is a testament to their resilience and adeptnessThis was a strong report and one can argue that the stock deserves to be up more despite the strong move due to supply and demand dynamics supporting a favorable outlookHalliburton will report Q3 earnings on Tuesday October 24 Investors should look for strong EPS figures greater than 075Share but the highlight will be how the changing supply and demand dynamics from OPEC are affecting the business I would expect a strong yearoveryear performance across the board with less sensational improvements quarter over quarterAs you might guess analysts agree that EPS figures will continue to trend upwards and Halliburton has managed to beat expectations in each of the past five quartersIt is likely that we will see the expected growth materialize as the major economies are essentially fully opened and we are unlikely to see any relief from OPEC in the medium turn There is a risk that if a conflict should deepen between Iran and the US following the horrific attacks in Israel Iran could aggressively ramp up production as it has in the past to raise funds This would soften oil prices slightly but a collapse would be unlikely without support from OPEC It is likely that Energy will become a hot theme over the coming months due to these tensions and firms like Halliburton could see some uncharacteristic volatilityHalliburton has undoubtedly proven its mettle amidst fluctuating commodity prices with the stock showcasing an admirable 45 surge in just a year This upward trend fortified by OPECs strategic production cuts and geopolitical intricacies hints at the resilience and adaptability of the company The Q2 earnings report further buttresses Halliburtons prowess in the oilfield landscape However investors should stay alert As global tensions simmer particularly concerning Iran and the US the energy sector might be in for a rollercoaster ride While Halliburton seems wellpoised to benefit from a surge in oil prices a recession could dent consumption and introduce headwinds There is also the tendency of lowcost producers to ramp up production when prices are high That said the trade is a lot clearer than it was a year ago though there is less meat left on the bone I rate Halliburton as a hold   Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institu,1,2023-10-20,5,0.9718,0.11111110493827195
67,67,These 15 Stocks Have Exhibited The Highest Correlation With Oil Prices Over The Last Month,By Andrew ProchnowAs the RussoUkrainian war continues to unfold in Eastern Europe another tragic incident occurred on October 7 when terrorists from the Gaza Strip executed a heinous surprise assault on Israel While the geopolitical consequences of this event areIsrael and the Gaza Strip are not significant crude oil exporters themselves but the broader Middle East region plays a pivotal role as a supplier of global energy resources Its worth noting that estimates indicate the Middle East holds up to 48 of the worlds proven crude oil reserves Consequently the recent escalation between Israel and Palestine presents a threat to global energy markets as it has the potential to trigger a chain reaction of violence in other parts of the regionCurrently a major concern is the potential involvement of Iran in the hostilities which could ensnare other Middle Eastern countries Many experts have suggested that Iran may have supported the terrorist organization Hamas in planning and preparing for the recent attacks on Israel Regardless of the veracity of these claims tensions could rapidly escalate between these historical adversariesThe primary and most pressing concern at the moment is the potential for further loss of life especially among innocent civilians Beyond that there is the risk that Iran may attempt to disrupt the global economy by obstructing traffic in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz This waterway is critical as it lies at the only passage between the Persian Gulf and the open sea Estimates indicate that approximately 33 of the worlds liquefied natural gas and roughly 25 of the worlds total annual oil consumption pass through this crucial waterwayUnfortunately global energy markets are exceptionally vulnerable at this juncture due to the disruptions stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine This means that any additional supply shocks could introduce significant chaos and undoubtedly inject fresh volatility into the prices of crude oil natural gas and other key commoditiesThe heightened risk of further market disruptions helps to explain the recent 18 jump in the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index OVX over the last five days and the more than 60 increase over the past monthCrude oil has been one of the most dynamic commodities in the market in 2023 surging from 70 per barrel to 95 per barrel a 35 increase between July 1 and September 30 However oil prices corrected in early October dropping to as low as 82 per barrel In the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel oil prices rebounded above 85 per barrel and are currently trading around 86 per barrelOn Oct 9 which was the first business day following the unexpected attacks on Israel over the weekend most of the energy sector showed an upward movement in line with the rising crude oil prices Many energy stocks closely followed the trend in crude oilOn Monday oil prices rallied by about 5 The list below highlights the energy stocks making the biggest moves in the immediate aftermath of the recent Hamas attacks on IsraelSome of the above symbols also appear on the list of stocks exhibiting the highest positive correlation with oil prices over the last 30 days Listed below are the 15 stocks sharing the highest correlation with   over the last month and their associated correlation coefficientsJust as a reminder when two assets exhibit a positive correlation meaning they tend to move in the same direction the correlation value falls within the range of 0 to 1 On the other hand when two assets are negatively correlated indicating they move in opposite directions the correlation falls between 1 and 0Correlations are typically classified as nonexistent weak semistrong or strong depending on the extent to which the two assets are linked For instance a correlation of 015 might be considered a weak positive correlation while a correlation of 075 could be termed a strong positive,2,2023-10-16,2,0.7725,-0.428571416326531

75,75,There Might Not Be Another Chance Like This For Years,There is a crazy mismatch in the market right now as it concerns real estate investment trusts REITs between  and Secondquarter REIT earnings releases thus far have been almostCompare the 12month performance of the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  to that of the SP 500  and Nasdaq 100Index The market seems to be convinced that REITs are facing serious and longlasting headwinds that will meaningfully damage their ability to grow in the long run Therefore many investors are avoiding REITs altogether rather than looking for valueWe think this pessimistic sentiment basicallyLets address all three points and finish by taking a look at five highquality REITs trading at what we view as crazy discounts to their fair values and fundamental performancesOn the first point if you watch financial media for any length of time youll inevitably hear commentators equating commercial real estate with office buildings and we all know the difficulties facing office real estate right now amid the new hybrid work environmentEven industry insiders sometimes equate the two See for example the title given to this sentiment survey from the Real Estate RoundtableThe survey is about  CRE but stress in  CRE in particular appears to be dragging down sentiment for all CREWhat about the idea that a big drop in downtown office utilization and values will have a negative effect on the cities in which theyre located Keep in mind that most nonoffice real estate properties and most of the properties in REITs portfolios are located  of downtown areasIt isnt a big leap in the mind of the average investor to go from commercial real estate to REITs You need only look at the occupancy rates of the four main sectors of CRE to discover that REITs do not equal officeWhile office occupancy has indeed plummeted since the onset of COVID19 occupancy of apartments retail and industrial remains at or near their highsThe market treats REITs as totally helpless in the face of rising interest rates almost mechanically discounting REITs as rates ratchet higherBut the market seems to forget that REITs have professional management teams whose job it is to maximize rent and minimize interest costs Most of them do a very good job at thisHence we find that REITs total FFO has surged higher since the onset of COVID19Moreover REITs weighted average debt maturity sits at about 8 years and generally speaking relatively few of their loans mature and require refinancing on any given year During the low interest rate period of 2020 and 2021 REITs very actively refinanced debt pushing out maturity dates as far as they could Many of them like Alexandria Real Estate  and NNN REIT  refinanced expiring debt with 30year bonds during that periodThat is why the weighted average interest rate on REITs debt has only barely budged higher in the last year even as interest rates have surgedOf course the longer interest rates remain elevated the higher their weighted average interest rates will go But while higher rates are a shortterm headwind they can be a longterm tailwind because of the next pointIn the long run higher interest rates combined with higher labor and construction costs act as a massive boon to commercial real estate and especially to REITs because it will result in far fewer new development projects coming to marketAs we all learned in Econ 101 the economy is basically operated on supply and demand If the supply of something stays flat while demand grows the price typically goes up This is true of real estate as much as for any other sector of the economyWhen interest rates and input costs go up development of new real estate properties grinds to a halt which leads to fewer new properties coming to market to compete with the existing stock a year or two down the roadThats exactly what weve seen happening over the last year or so in the CRE development industryHeres a chart showing sentiment a,334,2023-08-17,1,0.9742,-0.7777776913580343
76,76,"EDV: Pricing-In Long-Term Inflation Of 3-4%, Lowering Downside Risk (Rating Upgrade)",Over the past two and a half years I have had a relatively consistent bearish outlook on the longterm bond market  in early 2020 this outlook was due to my view that inflation would rise causing the stockbond correlationCompared to stocks bonds are typically more prone to mean reversion EDV has a solid yield today at 5 compared to the past allowing investors to earn that high yield on their current investment If longterm rates eventually decline EDV should rise back to its previous levels or at least those during the typical 2010s range 100140 or 66 to 130 higher than its current price Thus while its downside risk remains ample we must consider its positive potential should inflation and other factors Depending on our assumptions EDV may be a great investment today or among the worstSince 2020 there has been a considerable increase in the entirety of the yield curve Shortterm rates have risen more significantly than longterm rates but only by around 12 whereas the whole curve has increased by 34 In other words regardless of the bonds maturity its yield is likely around 34 higher The Federal Reserves rate policy effectively sets the short end of the curve while the long end is more sensitive to economic trendsTreasury bonds also come in inflationsecuritized bonds which pay a much lower yield but payout any changes to the consumer price index These lesserknown alternate bonds are essential because they can tell us how much EDV is expected to yield  longterm inflation For example in 2020 when rates were meager this figure almost declined to 1 meaning EDV had a negative expected return after inflation It is around 254 today the highest afterinflation return seen in around thirteen years See belowFundamentally EDV is a better opportunity when this figure is higher so long as we do not expect inflation to continue to run off Should the inflation outlook continue to increase then EDV would lose value as rates would likely rise to keep up with the inflation outlook Importantly for EDV shortterm changes in inflation are not necessary but instead it is the longterm expectations for inflation over the next 25 years That figure is almost always around the Feds 2 target but usually correlates to commodity prices because those inflationary factors are outside the Federal Reserves control See belowThe longterm inflation outlook is elevated today due to numerous enduring inflation forces One is the upward pressure on energy prices coming off very low energy prices during most of the 2010s Technically energy commodities like oil and gasoline are about average compared to consumer prices However in light of  there is some risk that they will rise higher soon and push the longterm inflation outlook Secondarily inflation is likely to remain high over the coming decades due to the governments great need for  inflation due to its extreme debt burden Even  and a shrinking workforcetoconsumer ratio are expected to continue to promote inflation through chronic skilled labor shortagesInflation today is much lower than it was during the peak last year Many attribute that change to success in the Federal Reserves effort to combat inflation through higher interest rates and quantitative tightening Indeed those efforts have moderated inflation QT has also likely significantly lowered EDVs value because the Federal Reserve stopped supporting that market through longterm Treasury purchases However historically inflation can fall before rising even higher This occurred twice during the 1970s likely one of the most relevant periods to today in recent history See belowThe core cause of the inflation spikes during the 1970s was the increase in energy prices stemming from the  which occurred to the week exactly forty years ago The embargo was caused in protest to the US military support for Israel Over has once again called on OPEC to pursue ,6,2023-10-20,1,0.9912,-0.3333333111111126

93,93,"TotalEnergies: Energy Prices And Russia Drag On Earnings, But Still Decent Company",On Thursday October 26 2023 European energy supermajor TotalEnergies SE   its third quarter 2023 earnings results At first glance these results were mixed as TotalEnergies managed to beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of revenueThe fact that TotalEnergies revenues went down yearoveryear is not necessarily anything that we need to worry about After all it was certainly not the only energy company to have experienced such a phenomenon with respect to its results Exxon Mobil  which also reported lastAs longtime readers are no doubt well aware it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a companys earnings results before delving into an analysis of its results This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis Therefore here are the highlights from TotalEnergies thirdquarter 2023 earnings resultsIt seems essentially certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights will notice is that many measures of TotalEnergies financial performance came in weaker during the third quarter of 2023 than they did during the equivalent quarter of last year One of the biggest reasons for this is that energy prices were lower on average during the most recent quarter than they were during the third quarter of last year We can see this quite clearly hereWe can see that the price of oil did finally start to rise during this quarter following several months of suppression partly caused by the United States Federal Government flooding the market from oil using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Basically as I  earlier this year the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia made the decision to cut crude oil production in order to keep the balance between supply and demand very tight In effect what these cuts were intended to do was offset the impact of the sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve The cuts remain in this place to this day yet the Federal Government stopped selling oil from its stockpile back in midJuly As of right now there are 351274 million barrels of crude oil in the nations storage which is the lowest level that has been seen since the early 1980sAs such the United States probably cannot use its national storage stocks to artificially manipulate the price of crude oil anymore After all there is a minimum amount of crude oil that needs to be stored in the salt caverns simply to maintain their structural integrity Thus with the cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remaining in effect the balance between the supply and demand for crude oil became tighter and pushed up energy pricesHowever we still see in the chart above that the average price of crude oil was lower in the third quarter of this year than during the equivalent quarter of last year This is reflected in TotalEnergies results as the company reported that it received an average of 7890 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the quarter compared to 9360 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the equivalent quarter of last year It should be fairly obvious why this would have a negative impact on TotalEnergies financial performance After all if the company received less money per unit of product sold then its overall revenue will be lower all else being equalHowever all else is rarely equal with a company like TotalEnergies As noted in the highlights the company saw its production decline in the most recent quarter compared to the equivalent one last year During the third quarter of 2023 TotalEnergies produced an average of 2476 million barrels of oil equivalents per day That was a 723 decline from the 2669 million barrels of oil equivalents per day that the company averaged during the yearago quarter That also had a negative impact on the companys financial performance After all a lower production means that it h,1,2023-10-30,5,-0.9818,-0.8333332638888947

102,102,Buy Gold In October 2023: The Planets Are Aligning For Its Resurgence,ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista  yesterday thatIn this article we are going to look at the various factors that are aligning to lead to what we believe will be a resurgence for gold  in the coming months and yearsThe ongoing conflict in the Middle East has sent shockwaves through global markets with investors rushing to shield their portfolios from the ensuing uncertainty that the conflict may spread throughout the region and ultimately even lead to a conflict that embroils two major oil exporters in Iran and Saudi Arabia Gold with its historical precedent of being a safehaven asset has witnessed a significant jumpMoreover the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe between Russia and Ukraine and its Western Allies as well as the growing tensions in East Asia between North Korea and South Korea and between China and Taiwan  with the potential for catastrophic wars to erupt from any of those hot spots  provide additional incentive to own gold during these geopolitically volatile timesGold has traditionally been an  against inflation With the global economy experiencing significant volatility and uncertainty at the moment and various nations still trying to balance fighting off inflationary pressures with trying to avoid falling into recession gold looks like an increasingly prudent investmentDespite the gold price initially falling more than 11 from its May high due to the Feds hawkish outlook the precious metal still holds potential for price appreciation in the coming yearsAnd it has already begun to make a comeback in recent daysMoreover it seems probable that the US Government will continue its runaway deficit spending for the foreseeable future Consequently this will exert significant pressure on the Federal Reserve to eventually reduce interest rates potentially resulting in negative real interest rates in the long run As a result inflation rates are expected to surpass nominal interest rates creating a highly favorable scenario for gold over the long termAnother reason to be bullish on gold right now is that historically gold has demonstrated a pattern of delivering positive average returns of 071 and 13 in November and December respectively due in part to a rise in jewelry demand and a generally weaker dollar in December As a result if history is any guide buying gold in October could be a great riskadjusted moveThe recent surge in central bank purchases of gold underscores the precious metals enduring appeal amidst global economic and geopolitical tumult Central banks both from advanced economies and emerging marketdeveloping economies EMDE are amassing gold reserves at a pace not seen for over 50 years with these entities accounting for 34 of total gold demand in the third quarter of 2022 and their rapid pace of buying continuing into 2023This buying spree was likely prompted at least in part by the geopolitical upheaval caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant sanctions on Russia prompting a reevaluation of US dollar reserves vulnerability This is evidenced by the fact that 42 of banks anticipate a decline in US dollar holdings according to a World Gold Council  Furthermore nations like Russia and China have been aggressively purchasing gold potentially as a safeguard against foreign asset seizures EMDE banks often more proactive in their goldbuying endeavors than their Western counterparts clearly increasingly view gold not merely as a historical store of wealth but as a strategic asset that provides a buffer against potential payment crises arising from current or future sanctions and insulating their often more fragile economies against global financial crisesIf this strong central bank demand continues  which it is showing no signs of slowing down  it will likely provide a pretty strong tailwind for gold prices over the long termThanks to its multimillennia history of being a safehaven asset gold is once agai,64,2023-10-23,2,0.9808,-0.5384615177514801

104,104,Occidental Petroleum Continues To Evolve,August 15th proved to be an interesting day for shareholders of   This massive diversified energy firm that has now long been favored by Warren Buffett might be thought of as just another traditional playerRecognizing that its imperative to focus on the long haul management has been for years now investing in preparing the enterprise for a cleaner future The latest evidence of this came on August 15th when management  the purchase of a technology innovator in the carbon capture space Although it will take years before investments like this start to become meaningful to the company the longterm growth prospects from said investments will be remarkable And thatIn a press release issued on August 15th the management team at Occidental Petroleum stated that they entered into an  all of the stock of a Canadian firm called Carbon Engineering Ltd The allcash deal is valued at approximately 11 billion Interestingly the transaction will not be made all at once Instead it will be made in three roughly equivalent payments over a threeyear window of time with the first of these totaling about 367 million occurring at closing some time before the end of this year Of course that timeline could change some since the entity that Occidental Petroleum is purchasing is a Canadian enterprise and is subject to Canadian regulatory oversight on top of any oversight that must be handled here at homeMost people myself included have never heard of Carbon Engineering Ltd before this But if you are at all interested in the alternative energy space you likely have heard of what the company focuses on Since 2019 Occidental Petroleum has been working with Carbon Engineering Ltd When it comes to what is referred to as DAC or direct air capture technology For those who dont know DAC is a process that utilizes large fans in order to suck air into a system that runs that air through multiple filtersThe goal from this process is to extract the carbon from the air after which the air will be released back into the wild The carbon meanwhile will often be converted into a liquid and pumped back into the Earth or it can be used as a feedstock for other purposes It is important to note that theres a difference between DAC and CCUS carbon capture utilization and storage While CCUS focuses on capturing emissions that are currently being ejected into the atmosphere from energy production and other facilities DAC focuses on removing emissions from the atmosphere irrespective of where those emissions came from or when they were ejected Today Occidental Petroleum is focusing on both pathsUnfortunately we dont know much about the company besides this We do know however that management believes this will open multiple revenue opportunities for the company in the years to come In addition to aiding in the further development of Stratos the largest DAC plant in the world the technology will also open up the opportunity for the company to generate revenue from technology licensing and royaltiesThis is not the companys first foray into this kind of work In fact the company has an entire portion of its business dedicated to preparing for a low carbon future On top of making investments in thirdparty entities that are currently developing technology such as NET Power the company also focuses on the development and commercialization of its own DAC technologies For instance as of the end of the 2022 fiscal year the company had successfully achieved zero routine flaring of gas across both its oil and natural gas operations in the US They did this eight years ahead of the 2030 target set by the World Bank They also managed to reduce emissions of methane by 33 compared to what they were in 2020 And they also in 2022 invested 530 million into low carbon businesses technologies and other related opportunities The plan for 2023 had originally been to invest up to 500 million into various projects W,0,2023-10-25,6,0.9899,0.7499999062500118
105,105,The Bullish Case For Oil Is Still Compelling,Not since November of last year have we seen oil prices where they are today We are close by far to the highest pricing that crude has traded at all year As of this writing WTI crude for instance is at 9118 per barrel Not surprisingly Brent crude isThe last article that I published that covered the oil market generally came out in early April of this year At that time I was talking about the new OPEC production cut and how that represented a massive gift to the oil sector Normally when I talk about investing I like to identify individual companies that should rise or fall materially But when it comes to the oil patch there are many different types of companies to choose from with each one having a significantly different risk vs reward payoff compared to the others For some investors it just makes it easier to buy into an ETF that appreciates if oil prices rise or drops if they fallBack then the ETF I chose as the primary emphasis for my article was   But there are plenty of others to choose from each one with its own positives and negatives Examples include           and   To be clear investors would be wise to evaluate each of these ETFs individually to see which one best fits their own investment preferences and risk appetite But in general one thing that these all should have in common is that as oil prices rise they should appreciate This should be true at least in the short termRegardless of the vehicle that each individual investor chooses to play in the oil market a case could be made by some that prices are too high and should drop from here Theres certainly data to support that view Take data provided by the EIA for instance In its most recent ShortTerm Energy Outlook which was published earlier this month the agency calculated that for 2023 global oil supply would come in at about 10118 million barrels per day This would be about 021 million barrels per day higher than the 10097 million in consumption that would be experienced This disparity might not seem like much to some investors But it could have a major impact on global oil markets if true The total excess supply spread over a single year would be 7665 million barrelsNow its important to point out that just because inventories are rising that this shouldnt necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on oil It all depends on how much crude already is out there Generally the range that should be considered healthy for the environment would be between 55 and 60 days worth of supply of crude in OECD nations Whenever this number starts ticking above 60 we start to drift into bearish territory Based on the STEO report issued by the end of this year we should be at roughly 6057 days worth of supply for OECD nations That would translate to excess crude amongst developed nations of 26 million barrels To make matters worse the 2024 calendar year should see global demand of 10288 million barrels per day Thats 055 million barrels per day higher than the 10233 million barrels per day of consumption that has been forecasted That would translate to 20075 million barrels of additional crude throughout the year with OECD inventories climbing to 284 billion barrels or 6214 daysLooking at the most recently available weekly  we see that domestic crude inventories for the US excluding whats in the SPR Strategic Petroleum Reserve are about 127 billion barrels Thats an increase over the 123 billion barrels of crude seen one year earlier However if we include the SPR into the picture domestic inventories would have declined from 165 billion barrels to 162 billion This is because in order to combat high oil prices the US has drained a lot of the oil in the SPR taking inventories from 4226 million barrels last year to 351 million this yearSo to summarize what we have on the bearish side of the equation is the EIA forecasting continued growth in production that,46,2023-08-17,5,0.9629,-0.11111109876543349

107,107,ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,Energy MLP stocks were a bright spot in a challenging third quarter for equity markets with the Alerian MLP Index returning 989 as the SP 500 Index   declined 327 Supply cuts from OPEC combined with lower US inventories pushed oil prices higher fueling further inflation and interest rate concerns  a headwind for broad equities but a positive for energy stocksThe dynamics affecting the MLP market remain unchanged Global economies continue to face multiple headwinds led by a combination of stubbornly high though recently moderating inflation elevated geopolitical uncertainty and lingering supply chain and policy impacts from the COVID19 pandemic In the US we have begun to see the dampening effects on the economy of tighter monetary conditions During 2022 equity markets began pricing in a reasonable chance of recession both in the US and abroad Thus far in 2023 global equity markets have recovered most of the losses incurred during 2022 and expectations are increasing that developed economies might avert a severe recessionCrude oil prices fell from more than 120 per barrel in June 2022 to 70 per barrel to end June 2023 Recession fears left oil market traders fearful of global demand downdrafts for crude oil in 2023 much like those witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis GC A stronger US dollar and largescale releases of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR further pressured oil prices On the other hand demand fear was partially offset by some optimism for a rebound in China consumption with the lifting of COVID19 restrictions The surprise OPEC supply cut of 11 million barrels per day at the end of March also likely puts a floor on oil prices over the near term With better visibility on global demand impacts from rising interest rates oil prices steadied and rose in July August and SeptemberEssentially all of this oil demand growth is expected in developing nations rather than OECD nations We would argue that oil prices of roughly 70 per barrel at the end of June discounted that oil demand growth will not approach levels expected by oil economists in 2023 and 2024 Said differently oil traders seem to expect a material contraction in global oil demand growth rates compared to oil economists A final twist to oil demand analysis remains the timing of the US refilling its vastly depleted SPR After drawing down the SPR by roughly 275 million barrels or 45 in the previous 18 months the US government announced in June initial plans to begin refilling the SPR beginning in September Thus what has been a meaningful source of supply in the crude oil markets will become a source of demand looking forwardIf global oil demand growth does approach roughly 2 million barrels per day in 2023 and another 1015 million barrels per day in 2024 we see upside in oil prices over the balance of 2023 and into 2024 The supply side of the global oil market will meaningfully struggle to meet that kind of demand growth We would also argue that the incremental barrel of oil supply in such a scenario will almost have to be a barrel of US oil  continuing to drive visibility in US oil production growth to the benefit of US midstream companiesLooking at natural gas the shortterm outlook is decidedly negative while the intermediate to longterm outlook remains robust An almost complete lack of typical weather last winter left natural gas storage levels 32 higher at the end of March 2023 than a year before Higher storage levels entering the spring and summer also equates to lower natural gas demand to refill storage levels As a result US natural gas prices fell from above 5 per mmbtu at the end of March 2022 to 2 per mmbtu at the end of March 2023 In our view pricing for US natural gas will not meaningfully recover until the beginning of winter with an effective reset on storage levelsWith continued organic domestic demand growth and inc,8,2023-10-24,5,-0.0045,-0.6363636074380178

121,121,Six Themes On Artificial Intelligence To Consider,One of the big trends in markets throughout 2023 has been artificial intelligence or AII tend to avoid jumping into crowded themes sometimes to my benefit sometimes to my detriment so AI is not something I have written much about publicly I preferI did cover the topic in a May  report and then again partially in a July  report It has been a topic Ive been following closely despite not writing heavily about yet and this issue will draw from those prior reports and more recent information to cover some of the themes that I think are worthwhile to think about that I dont see getting a lot of coverageThe takes on AI have ranged from this is all hype and theres nothing here to its going to kill us all in five years and take over the worldUnsurprisingly I fall somewhere between those two extremes where I think there are clearly major breakthroughs here but any emergent technology will be prone to hype cycles and will get ahead of itself from time to timeAnyone who has taken the time to use some of the latest tools can see the value here which didnt exist a few years ago As the technology matures and becomes ubiquitous of course itll have a significant economic impactHowever any exponential technology is hard to map out with a long timeline But a useful exercise is to figure out what the right  are even if we dont necessarily know all of the  to those questions Theres nothing worse than not even knowing what questions to ask or what the potential bounds or bottlenecks are with regards to what is otherwise a highly complex topic We must strive to have at least a basic map of the terrain in other words even if there are a lot of uncharted areasIm not much of a programmer the last time I wrote any code at all was probably around 2014 so any views I have on it are more from the engineering hardware side or from an economics angle rather than talking about anything software specific And what Im mainly going to be trying to do is to figure out some of the right questions to think about and to start mapping out some of the terrain to see where the bottlenecks or inflection points might beWhen we think of technological development we often imagine a smooth exponential line upwardsIn reality technological development is mostly a series of overlapping stepchanges Certain technological breakthroughs occur cause a multidecade technological  and then run into a hard ceiling and  until the next breakthrough emerges Thats why there are often science fiction stories set at a certain date and by the time we actually reach that date our world isnt as advanced as the writer expected eg the 1968 book  was set in 1992 and its 1982 film adaptation  was set in 2019The reason this is relevant is because without the emergence of a new breakthrough technology within a given industry often underperforms our expectations if we assume a continuous growth model In contrast when there is a new breakthrough technology within a given industry can easily outperform our expectations and change things more quickly than we expectOften the discovery and application of a more concentrated energy source serves as a big stepchange The invention of the steam engine and the associated mining of coal ushered in the industrial revolution which then was compounded by the invention of the internal combustion engine and the associated production of oil This gave humanity enough energy density for highspeed travel broadly available running water and the mechanization of agriculture All of these things freed up most people to leave subsistence farming and to work on other things and to have more sanitary living conditions which led to a boom in industrial productivity and lifespansIn other words a large portion of what we attribute to technology is encapsulated in this chartIn the medical industry the discovery of germs and the associated invention of antibacterial medicine the invention of a,94,2023-09-04,8,0.9838,0.21739129489603065

130,130,The Costs And Investment Implications Of Reshoring,For the past three decades and in some ways stretching back up to five decades the US has been in a relative industrial declineMore specifically the share of the US economy that has been involved with manufacturingWe can see this manifested in our structural trade deficitAnd we can see it in our industrial production per capitaTo some extent this is to be expected as a country grows in wealth it tends to shift a bit more towards services and begins to rely on developing countries to supply it with physical goods However a number of countries like Switzerland Singapore Japan South Korea Taiwan and at least until their recent energy problems Germany have been successful at maintaining largeThe challenge with deindustrialization is that an economy can become hollowedout andor it can face national security issues during a cold war type of environment or during various logistical emergencies In other words its just not just about access to plastic trinkets its about access to critical things we dont think about like medical dyes military components or even just basic tools that we use for everything elseSo the themes of onshoring or reshoring or nearshoring have become a hot topic lately to some extent on the corporate level but especially on the federal level It refers to the idea of moving manufacturing facilities back to the US or to nearby countries so that supply chains in general are shorter less complex and more resilient And along these lines various stimulus efforts have gone into encouraging a boom in domestic manufacturingAnd it  showing up in the data This chart shows annualized spending on the construction of manufacturing facilitiesThe US used to run sub100 billion per year in manufacturing construction expenditure and now it has more than doubled Thats tangible even after adjusting for inflationHowever to provide context to the situation the US is currently heavily reliant on Chinas industrial base that is worth many trillions of dollars So this extra 100 billion just puts us in the first inning here if this is indeed to be the start of a reversalFor decades the United States was a larger trading partner than China for most countries However by the late 2010s China had flipped the US in this regard and it has only tilted further in Chinas favor since thenThe ability to be the worlds largest trading partner requires both making stuff and having the logistics to organize and ship that stuff Along those lines among the  seven are in China one is in Korea one is in Singapore and one is in the Netherlands To find the US on the list we have to dig down into the top 20 and top 30 container portsChina now produces more steel than the rest of the world combined and more than 12x as much as the USChina is by far the world leader in solar panels In terms of market share they are more important for the global solar market than Saudi Arabia is for the global oil marketFor rare earth elements broadly which are widely used throughout the electronics industry including the alternative energy industry China produces more than the rest of the world combined In recent years the rest of the world exUS has been regaining a minority share Rare earth elements are not particularly rare but they are found in low concentrations and thus tend to be environmentally destructive to extract and refine Most wealthy regions dont want to deal with thatJust within the past three years Chinas auto exports have hockeysticked in terms of growth Last year China surpassed Germany and this year they are  as the worlds largest auto exporter We dont see them in the United States but if you travel around the world youll see a lot more Chinese cars on the road than just a few years agoHere in 2023 China also officially put their first commercial airplane  into service The world now has the ABCs of commercial aviation Airbus  of E,161,2023-08-12,1,0.9896,0.24999996875000394

150,150,Suncor Energy: 5 Reasons It's Going Higher,Suncor  is one of the largest oil companies in Canada Somewhat like Exxon Mobil  it produces oil processes that oil into refinery products such as gasoline and diesel and sells those end products inUnlike Exxon it does not drill for oil it extracts oil from oil sands which is more of a mining process than a drilling processSuncor is in what I will call the run out phase of its business It is past needing much exploration and development rather it is extracting its known reserves as we work through the energy transition Over the next few decades Suncor will produce oil and eventually have to transition to another business or cease operations in the middle of the centuryAs a result of lower capex and oilI rate Suncor a buy for Canadians It is worth watching for Americans and is a potential trade however be aware of the 15 dividend tax haircut if you intend to hold it longtermHere are five reasons why I think Suncor is a buy nowAs you can see from the following chart Suncor has 26 years of reservesIn addition it can produce those reserves profitably at an average price of 35 per barrel and still pay the dividend While we have seen 35 oil prices during Covid with the depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and EV adoption still several years away from causing outright demand destruction oil markets are likely to remain on Kirks peak oil plateau versus plungeAnother difference between Suncor and the other oil majors is that it has very little overseas exposure In other words well over 90 of its oil comes from its own sources in the oil sands therefore they are not exposed to what I would call foreign entanglementsThe ability to extract more oil from the sands does not come with significant capex thus margins are relatively high after the sunk in costs which are already sunkSuncor spends very little money on exploration and exploratory drilling Due to Canadian policy Suncor is essentially in a run off phase of its business That is they are simply going to extract their 26 year known reserves over timeThis gives Suncor much higher gross margins than other oil companies such as Exxon This can be seen in the following chart comparing Suncor to Exxon and Chevron Because Suncor has a very low cost per barrel it tends to have very high refinery margins also called the crack spread This means that when the raw material ie a barrel of oil is cracked it is turned into gasoline diesel or other enduser products The differential between the barrel of oil cost and what the end products are sold for is called the crack spreadThe Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is nearing completion This expansion will more than double the amount of oil being transported to the West Coast and from there to Asia including China and India This will be a huge advantage for Suncor as it will enlarge its market which currently is mainly the US market and a minor amount to Europe from the East CoastNow admittedly the Trans Mountain has been under construction for 10 years and has run into all kinds of issues but there appears to be only one left before completion That revolves around Native Americans and environmentalists asking for a route deviation It appears at the moment that this issue will be resolved positively and that Sun Corps will be shipping to Asia sometime in 2024 or 2025 at the latestOver the last few quarters Suncor has bought back 22 of its shares Most investors have heard about Exxons huge 75 billion share buyback and Chevrons huge 50 billion share buyback but neither one has bought back nearly the number of shares on a percentage basis as Suncor hasSince Suncor has dedicated 23 billion per year for its dividend the dividend keeps growing with every share bought back since the 23 billion would be divided by a smaller number Management has said this will go on indefinitely based on free cash flow which is currently substantialSuncor is also paying,28,2023-10-17,4,0.9901,-0.24999996875000394

153,153,Exxon Mobil: Big Market Changes,Exxon Mobil  has long been a leader in accommodating market changes Some changes are obvious like the increase in the price of oil that should lead to a very good third quarter report as well asThe decrease in the  and light oil prices is currently happening because OPEC primarily Saudi Arabia when it comes to heavy oil is cutting back on production as are otherThis movement of oil prices threatens a longstanding US refining industry profit making strategy For a very long time the United States has mostly exported the light crude produced by the unconventional wells while importing the heavy oil even heavy oil with sulfur The industry then made an extra profit by upgrading the heavy oil into the same products that were made with light oil while capturing the extra revenue of the discount to the finished productBut when that discount no longer exists then the industry does not make an extra profit that justifies the assets needed for the extra refining processes If this was a temporary phenomenon then investors could put it down to just the usual volatility in pricing that will soon fix itselfBut the Canadian completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline Threatens to change this relationship permanently This longdelayed project is now over  Even with an expected reroute in some places the pipeline should be in operation within the next couple of years no guarantees of courseThis will allow a significant amount of Canadian production that was available to the United States with the usual heavy oil discount to be exported The volume carried through the pipeline will likely be significant enough to enable the discount between heavy oil and light oil to narrow It may narrow to the point that the profit the United States has long made on importing heavy oil while exporting light oil will decrease or maybe even disappearShould that prove to be the case the refining industry will be in for at least a period of lower profits during cyclical high pointsExxon Mobil normally integrates where it has a decent upstream business As a general rule the company builds the upstream business first and then adds other divisions as a valueadded way to grow for that particular upstream businessIn the case of the Permian the company may have inadvertently begun a refining trend expansion is actually the size of most middlesized refineries standalone So while many talk about the lack of new refineries the industry is working around that by expanding existing refineries to make up for the lack of new refineries It gets the industry to the same point as building new refineriesWhats even more interesting is that this refinery will handle the light crude that the company produces in the Permian This is a variance from the industry strategy noted above of exporting the light crude while importing the heavy crude to make a profit on that spread It could mean that the spread will not be worth the effort in the future What we will have to see is how many more expansion projects happen with the idea of handling light crudeThe third quarter itself is going to benefit from some of the best oil pricing so far in the current fiscal year Most investors remember that prices peaked roughly in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and it was downhill after that This year began with a fair amount of pessimism about oil prices despite the fact that the industry by and large made decent profits at those pricesI have been reporting for some time that well breakeven points have been dropping That should of course lead to lower corporate breakeven points and a more profitable industry at various oil pricesExxon Mobil not only benefits from higher prices but it also benefits from a drive to lower costs This project has been aided by previously mentioned sales of highcost production replaced by lowcost Permian production that the new refinery expansion project will serve in the next slide that Guyana and the Permian ,56,2023-09-27,4,0.7342,-0.09090908264462885

161,161,The Higher-Rates Narrative: A Rebuttal,Tenyear Treasury yields have increased dramatically over the last few months rising from a low of 34 in May of 2023 to a whopping 45 by the end of September Alongside this runup in rates has been the emergence of aInvestors thinking about how to allocate their assets between equities and US Treasuries or fixed income securities more broadly have to understand the higherrates narrative and then decide if they believe it Those who subscribe to the narrative may not find Treasuries attractive because rates could continue to increase thus driving down bond prices Those investors who believe the opposing narrative  thatWith this dilemma facing investors in mind I go through the hedge fund higherrates narrative and argue that while the hedge fund camps arguments are certainly compelling there is a more compelling set of counterarguments for why rates are currently too highTo better understand the issues involved lets now dive into Ackmans higherrates thesisAckman starts out his piece with the following I rearrange the order of some of the statements from the tweet to maintain a better discussion flowThe peace dividend is hardly gone Though there are many tragic counterexamples the global trend towards  that started in the wake of the Second World War is still in place to all of our benefit It is true that outsourcing to China is being reduced  to a large extent because   but global trade and outsourcing  with some countries like Mexico and Vietnam benefiting from the pivot away from China While there is evidence that these trends are leading to wage pressures in the US this is more of a slow transition away from China than an abrupt shift towards deglobalization Furthermore the current UAW strike targeting Detroits big three is driven largely by the unions attempt to  given to the auto manufacturers during the Global Financial Crisis GFC rather than an inflationtriggered demand for higher wages Given the concession catalyst for the UAW strike it is far from clear whether workers in other industries will follow suit or whether they have enough leverage to do soEnergy prices rise and fall with regularity Looking at the last 20 years of WTI prices shows no evidence of a trend towards higher real oil prices though there are many fluctuations over that time It is a market heavily influenced by OPEC and it is hard to imagine that OPEC will not face pressure to increase production should oil prices go substantially above 100 per barrel In addition US shale becomes very profitable at these  which naturally brings supply back into the market The SPR has indeed been  and this will lead to pricesupportive demand in the oil market But the logical conclusion of the sentence that Energy prices are rising rapidly is that this rise will at some point be arrested by market and geopolitical forcesAckman then points to the green energy transition which will certainly be expensive as a force that will lead to increasing inflation expectationsWhile inflationary expectations may rise in the future for a host of reasons they are currently under control and inflation expectations have not contributed to the recent increase in rates The current rise in rates is entirely driven by an increase in real rates as inflation breakevens have stayed largely unchanged presumably because the market believes the Fed will succeed in its inflation fightConsumer inflation expectation surveys also point to moderating inflationThe evidence for rising inflationary expectations is not there Inflation expectations  market and surveybased  are fallingOur national debt is rising as is public debt globally According to an  the US is not a particular outlier among advanced economies There has been a secular increase in public debt to GDP globally for the last 60 years a time of secularly declining interest rates This suggests there is no mechanical relationship between national debt to,31,2023-09-27,3,0.9214,-0.12499999218750048

163,163,Energy Transfer: Strong Income Generator Amid Uncertain Times,I last wrote on Energy Transfer  a bit more than three months ago see the chart below The  argued for a buyFastforward to now the stock has indeed delivered strong returns against an overall market decline To wit the stock has enjoyed aDespite the price rally I see the stock as an even stronger buy at this point and consequently this article will upgrade my rating to Strong Buy In the remainder of this article I will elaborate on two of my key considerations for my upgraded rating First I will argue that a few new catalysts have happened since then and they can provide ET with a better growth potential Second because of such a better growth potential the stock valuation has actually become even more discounted from the Graham PEOil prices have recovered strongly since my last article As seen from the chart below Brent futures were in the 75 range at that time It has since then reached a peak of almost 100 and currently hovers around 87 Now I see a couple of catalysts to keep oil prices or energycommodity prices in general elevated and provide a tailwind for ET in the near futureThe most important catalyst in my view sadly is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas In general geopolitical risks tend to increase demand for oil and commodities for several reasons Geopolitical conflicts tend to disrupt supply transportation and global trading At the same time both the general public and investors may seek to store more commodities as a hedge against the ongoing geopolitical conflictsSpecific to the IsraelHamas conflict I see more immediate impacts on oil and energy prices The conflict could have nonlinear ramifications on other countries in the Middle Eastern region many of which are important oil productionexport countries Iran is the first specific example that came to my mind Iran is a significant oil production country and also a known supporter of Hamas As such its a possible scenario in my view we could see a tightening of restrictions on Iranian oil exportsAdmittedly these catalysts are relevant to the general energy sector and wont only serve as a tailwind for ET However I will argue that thanks to a few differentiating factors ET is better positioned to navigate the ramifications of such geopolitical events than the sector average The top differentiators are its scale and integrated operations ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America Its assets are highly integrated which allows it to achieve significant operational efficiencies For example its pipeline network connects production areas to processing facilities and storage terminals which allows the company to move products quickly and efficiently to marketThis unique strength has provided ET with the resilience to deliver strong results amid market turmoil The following chart shows its recent dividend payouts as a reflection of such resilience As seen the dividend amount has recovered very quickly since the COVID19 pandemic It increased rapidly from 0175 per share in the first quarter of 2022 to 031 per share at this point This represents an increase of approximately 77 and its current payout already is higher than its prepandemic level of 0305 per shareThe stock is currently yielding 906 on an FWD basis Such a high yield when combined with its resilience and discounted valuation argued next makes it a strong income generator in uncertain times like thisFor the valuation of a traditional business like ET I will follow the Graham approach as detailed in his book Intelligent Investor In particular I will start with the socalled Graham PE As detailed in my earlier articleIn ETs case consensus estimates project an EPS growth rate of 1 CAGR at the time of my original article The above projection was too pessimistic in my view But even with a 1 growth rate its Graham PE would be 105x At that time the stock w,37,2023-10-10,2,0.9838,-0.037037035665294975

177,177,A Good Time To Be An Energy Bull,In terms of oil market fundamentals things remain relatively bullish at least in the short term Starting with commercial inventories the EIA reported another 22 million barrel draw this past week following a 21 million barrel draw last weekFollowing what has been a few months of persistent inventory drawdowns crude oil supplies in the US are becoming increasingly tightNot only are commercial inventories overall reaching the lows of 2022 prior to the Biden Administration draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but crude oil levels at Cushing Oklahoma have fallen to only 22 million barrels down from a twoyear high of 43 million barrels in JuneSuch stockpiles are worryingly close to minimum operating levels a point which brings into question the quality of remaining stocksWith inventories continuing to track well below their fiveyearWith the inventory picture suggesting excess demand relative to supply other indicators of the physical market also confirm this notion Notably the crude oil futures term structure is currently at its highest level of backwardation in over a yearBackwardation implies there is a supply deficit as market participants are willing to pay a premium for instant delivery despite the associated delivery and storage costs As a result any deficit will need to be met via drawing down inventories Clearly this is exactly what is unfolding at presentNot only is this true of the term structure as a whole but frontend prompt spreads are also suggesting the oil market is tightHowever while backwardation is bullish for prices extreme backwardation and significant spikes in prompt spreads also tend to coincide with shortterm peaks in price something energy bulls should be aware ofThe fact that crack spreads have diverged lower throughout September despite higher prices is one physical market indicator suggesting a correction in the oil price could be on the cards particularly as we are entering refinery maintenance seasonCrack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined productsOne of the big drivers of this recent rally has been the significant level of speculative buying we have seen from hedge funds and CTAsAfter being caught bearish to the highest degree in nearly a decade earlier this year managed money positioning in the futures market has quickly gone from extreme bearishness to extreme bullishnessIf we measure managed money positioning as a percentage of longs relative to total managed money we can see hedge funds and CTAs are now equally as long oil as they have been in yearsSimilar spikes have at the very least coincided with shortterm pullbacks in price Given how swift this rally in oil prices has been I suspect we are due for some kind of pullback if only minorWhile a shortterm correction may be due the mediumterm outlook remains bullish Indeed not only do the realtime indicators of supply and demand remain favourable but forecasts for the remainder of 2023 suggest this deficit is set to continueNotably the EIA  who are notorious for underestimating demand  continue to see a deficit through Q4 of this yearA view eschewed by Morgan StanleyMeanwhile oil analysts at Standard Chartered continue to call for a 13 mbd deficit through Q4 and expect inventory draws to continue into 2024Although such forecasts are inherently difficult and errorprone it seems we are likely to continue to see a supply and demand imbalance toward the bullish side of the spectrum as we close out 2023 an environment that should help put a floor under the oil priceFrom a price action perspective the daily chart for crude continues to trade bullishly The downtrend that encompassed the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023 is clearly behind us with the major moving averages now turning up and the important 8285 resistance level well and truly brokenHowever as I have stated it seems ,120,2023-10-12,5,-0.9828,-0.5294117335640156
